Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and\
      \ Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;\n    for the Lord has spoken:\n\
      “Children have I reared and brought up,\n    but they have rebelled against\
      \ me.\n"
    3: "³ The ox knows its owner,\n    and the donkey its master's crib,\nbut Israel\
      \ does not know,\n    my people do not understand.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Ah, sinful nation,\n    a people laden with iniquity,\noffspring of evildoers,\n\
      \    children who deal corruptly!\nThey have forsaken the Lord,\n    they have\
      \ despised the Holy One of Israel,\n    they are utterly estranged. \n"
    5: "⁵ Why will you still be struck down?\n    Why will you continue to rebel?\n\
      The whole head is sick,\n    and the whole heart faint.\n"
    6: "⁶ From the sole of the foot even to the head,\n    there is no soundness in\
      \ it,\nbut bruises and sores\n    and raw wounds;\nthey are not pressed out\
      \ or bound up\n    or softened with oil. \n"
    7: "⁷ Your country lies desolate;\n    your cities are burned with fire;\nin your\
      \ very presence\n    foreigners devour your land;\n    it is desolate, as overthrown\
      \ by foreigners.\n"
    8: "⁸ And the daughter of Zion is left\n    like a booth in a vineyard,\nlike\
      \ a lodge in a cucumber field,\n    like a besieged city. \n"
    9: "⁹ If the Lord of hosts\n    had not left us a few survivors,\nwe should have\
      \ been like Sodom,\n    and become like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord,\n    you rulers of Sodom!\nGive ear to the\
      \ teaching of our God,\n    you people of Gomorrah!\n"
    11: "¹¹ “What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\n    says the Lord;\n\
      I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\n    and the fat of well-fed beasts;\n\
      I do not delight in the blood of bulls,\n    or of lambs, or of goats. \n"
    12: "¹² “When you come to appear before me,\n    who has required of you\n   \
      \ this trampling of my courts?\n"
    13: "¹³ Bring no more vain offerings;\n    incense is an abomination to me.\n\
      New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations—\n    I cannot endure iniquity\
      \ and solemn assembly.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your new moons and your appointed feasts\n    my soul hates;\nthey have\
      \ become a burden to me;\n    I am weary of bearing them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ When you spread out your hands,\n    I will hide my eyes from you;\neven\
      \ though you make many prayers,\n    I will not listen;\n    your hands are\
      \ full of blood.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;\n    remove the evil of your deeds\
      \ from before my eyes;\ncease to do evil,\n"
    17: "¹⁷     learn to do good;\nseek justice,\n    correct oppression;\nbring justice\
      \ to the fatherless,\n    plead the widow's cause. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord:\nthough your sins are\
      \ like scarlet,\n    they shall be as white as snow;\nthough they are red like\
      \ crimson,\n    they shall become like wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you are willing and obedient,\n    you shall eat the good of the land;\n"
    20: "²⁰ but if you refuse and rebel,\n    you shall be eaten by the sword;\n \
      \   for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” \n"
    21: "²¹ How the faithful city\n    has become a whore,\n    she who was full of\
      \ justice!\nRighteousness lodged in her,\n    but now murderers.\n"
    22: "²² Your silver has become dross,\n    your best wine mixed with water.\n"
    23: "²³ Your princes are rebels\n    and companions of thieves.\nEveryone loves\
      \ a bribe\n    and runs after gifts.\nThey do not bring justice to the fatherless,\n\
      \    and the widow's cause does not come to them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore the Lord declares,\n    the Lord of hosts,\n    the Mighty One\
      \ of Israel:\n“Ah, I will get relief from my enemies\n    and avenge myself\
      \ on my foes.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will turn my hand against you\n    and will smelt away your dross as\
      \ with lye\n    and remove all your alloy.\n"
    26: "²⁶ And I will restore your judges as at the first,\n    and your counselors\
      \ as at the beginning.\nAfterward you shall be called the city of righteousness,\n\
      \    the faithful city.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion shall be redeemed by justice,\n    and those in her who repent, by\
      \ righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But rebels and sinners shall be broken together,\n    and those who forsake\
      \ the Lord shall be consumed.\n"
    29: "²⁹ For they shall be ashamed of the oaks\n    that you desired;\nand you\
      \ shall blush for the gardens\n    that you have chosen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For you shall be like an oak\n    whose leaf withers,\n    and like a\
      \ garden without water.\n"
    31: "³¹ And the strong shall become tinder,\n    and his work a spark,\nand both\
      \ of them shall burn together,\n    with none to quench them."
  2:
    1: "¹ The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² It shall come to pass in the latter days\n    that the mountain of the house\
      \ of the Lord\nshall be established as the highest of the mountains,\n    and\
      \ shall be lifted up above the hills;\nand all the nations shall flow to it,\n"
    3: "³     and many peoples shall come, and say:\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\n    to the house of the God of Jacob,\nthat he may teach us\
      \ his ways\n    and that we may walk in his paths.”\nFor out of Zion shall go\
      \ forth the law,\n    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ He shall judge between the nations,\n    and shall decide disputes for many\
      \ peoples;\nand they shall beat their swords into plowshares,\n    and their\
      \ spears into pruning hooks;\nnation shall not lift up sword against nation,\n\
      \    neither shall they learn war anymore. \n"
    5: "⁵ O house of Jacob,\n    come, let us walk\n    in the light of the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ For you have rejected your people,\n    the house of Jacob,\nbecause they\
      \ are full of things from the east\n    and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines,\n\
      \    and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.\n"
    7: "⁷ Their land is filled with silver and gold,\n    and there is no end to their\
      \ treasures;\ntheir land is filled with horses,\n    and there is no end to\
      \ their chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land is filled with idols;\n    they bow down to the work of their\
      \ hands,\n    to what their own fingers have made.\n"
    9: "⁹ So man is humbled,\n    and each one is brought low—\n    do not forgive\
      \ them!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Enter into the rock\n    and hide in the dust\nfrom before the terror\
      \ of the Lord,\n    and from the splendor of his majesty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The haughty looks of man shall be brought low,\n    and the lofty pride\
      \ of men shall be humbled,\nand the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² For the Lord of hosts has a day\n    against all that is proud and lofty,\n\
      \    against all that is lifted up—and it shall be brought low;\n"
    13: "¹³ against all the cedars of Lebanon,\n    lofty and lifted up;\n    and\
      \ against all the oaks of Bashan;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ against all the lofty mountains,\n    and against all the uplifted hills;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ against every high tower,\n    and against every fortified wall;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ against all the ships of Tarshish,\n    and against all the beautiful\
      \ craft.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled,\n    and the lofty pride\
      \ of men shall be brought low,\n    and the Lord alone will be exalted in that\
      \ day.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the idols shall utterly pass away.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ And people shall enter the caves of the rocks\n    and the holes of the\
      \ ground,\nfrom before the terror of the Lord,\n    and from the splendor of\
      \ his majesty,\n    when he rises to terrify the earth. \n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day mankind will cast away\n    their idols of silver and their\
      \ idols of gold,\nwhich they made for themselves to worship,\n    to the moles\
      \ and to the bats,\n"
    21: "²¹ to enter the caverns of the rocks\n    and the clefts of the cliffs,\n\
      from before the terror of the Lord,\n    and from the splendor of his majesty,\n\
      \    when he rises to terrify the earth.\n"
    22: "²² Stop regarding man\n    in whose nostrils is breath,\n    for of what\
      \ account is he?"
  3:
    1: "¹ For behold, the Lord God of hosts\n    is taking away from Jerusalem and\
      \ from Judah\nsupport and supply,\n    all support of bread,\n    and all support\
      \ of water;\n"
    2: "² the mighty man and the soldier,\n    the judge and the prophet,\n    the\
      \ diviner and the elder,\n"
    3: "³ the captain of fifty\n    and the man of rank,\nthe counselor and the skillful\
      \ magician\n    and the expert in charms.\n"
    4: "⁴ And I will make boys their princes,\n    and infants shall rule over them.\n"
    5: "⁵ And the people will oppress one another,\n    every one his fellow\n   \
      \ and every one his neighbor;\nthe youth will be insolent to the elder,\n  \
      \  and the despised to the honorable. \n"
    6: "⁶ For a man will take hold of his brother\n    in the house of his father,\
      \ saying:\n“You have a cloak;\n    you shall be our leader,\nand this heap of\
      \ ruins\n    shall be under your rule”;\n"
    7: "⁷ in that day he will speak out, saying:\n“I will not be a healer;\n    in\
      \ my house there is neither bread nor cloak;\nyou shall not make me\n    leader\
      \ of the people.”\n"
    8: "⁸ For Jerusalem has stumbled,\n    and Judah has fallen,\nbecause their speech\
      \ and their deeds are against the Lord,\n    defying his glorious presence.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ For the look on their faces bears witness against them;\n    they proclaim\
      \ their sin like Sodom;\n    they do not hide it.\nWoe to them!\n    For they\
      \ have brought evil on themselves.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them,\n    for they shall\
      \ eat the fruit of their deeds.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,\n    for what his hands have\
      \ dealt out shall be done to him.\n"
    12: "¹² My people—infants are their oppressors,\n    and women rule over them.\n\
      O my people, your guides mislead you\n    and they have swallowed up the course\
      \ of your paths. \n"
    13: "¹³ The Lord has taken his place to contend;\n    he stands to judge peoples.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord will enter into judgment\n    with the elders and princes of\
      \ his people:\n“It is you who have devoured the vineyard,\n    the spoil of\
      \ the poor is in your houses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ What do you mean by crushing my people,\n    by grinding the face of the\
      \ poor?”\ndeclares the Lord God of hosts. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord said:\nBecause the daughters of Zion are haughty\n    and walk\
      \ with outstretched necks,\n    glancing wantonly with their eyes,\nmincing\
      \ along as they go,\n    tinkling with their feet,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ therefore the Lord will strike with a scab\n    the heads of the daughters\
      \ of Zion,\n    and the Lord will lay bare their secret parts. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands,
      and the crescents; '
    19: '¹⁹ the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves; '
    20: '²⁰ the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets; '
    21: '²¹ the signet rings and nose rings; '
    22: '²² the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags; '
    23: "²³ the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Instead of perfume there will be rottenness;\n    and instead of a belt,\
      \ a rope;\nand instead of well-set hair, baldness;\n    and instead of a rich\
      \ robe, a skirt of sackcloth;\n    and branding instead of beauty.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your men shall fall by the sword\n    and your mighty men in battle.\n"
    26: "²⁶ And her gates shall lament and mourn;\n    empty, she shall sit on the\
      \ ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will\
      \ eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your\
      \ name; take away our reproach.” \n"
    2: '² In that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious, and
      the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel. '
    3: '³ And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy,
      everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem, '
    4: '⁴ when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion
      and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment
      and by a spirit of burning. '
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her
      assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night;
      for over all the glory there will be a canopy. '
    6: ⁶ There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and
      a shelter from the storm and rain.
  5:
    1: "¹ Let me sing for my beloved\n    my love song concerning his vineyard:\n\
      My beloved had a vineyard\n    on a very fertile hill.\n"
    2: "² He dug it and cleared it of stones,\n    and planted it with choice vines;\n\
      he built a watchtower in the midst of it,\n    and hewed out a wine vat in it;\n\
      and he looked for it to yield grapes,\n    but it yielded wild grapes. \n"
    3: "³ And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem\n    and men of Judah,\njudge between\
      \ me and my vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What more was there to do for my vineyard,\n    that I have not done in\
      \ it?\nWhen I looked for it to yield grapes,\n    why did it yield wild grapes?\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ And now I will tell you\n    what I will do to my vineyard.\nI will remove\
      \ its hedge,\n    and it shall be devoured;\nI will break down its wall,\n \
      \   and it shall be trampled down.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will make it a waste;\n    it shall not be pruned or hoed,\n    and briers\
      \ and thorns shall grow up;\nI will also command the clouds\n    that they rain\
      \ no rain upon it. \n"
    7: "⁷ For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts\n    is the house of Israel,\nand\
      \ the men of Judah\n    are his pleasant planting;\nand he looked for justice,\n\
      \    but behold, bloodshed;\nfor righteousness,\n    but behold, an outcry!\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Woe to those who join house to house,\n    who add field to field,\nuntil\
      \ there is no more room,\n    and you are made to dwell alone\n    in the midst\
      \ of the land.\n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord of hosts has sworn in my hearing:\n“Surely many houses shall be\
      \ desolate,\n    large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath,\n    and a homer of\
      \ seed shall yield but an ephah.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to those who rise early in the morning,\n    that they may run after\
      \ strong drink,\nwho tarry late into the evening\n    as wine inflames them!\n"
    12: "¹² They have lyre and harp,\n    tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts,\n\
      but they do not regard the deeds of the Lord,\n    or see the work of his hands.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore my people go into exile\n    for lack of knowledge;\ntheir honored\
      \ men go hungry,\n    and their multitude is parched with thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite\n    and opened its mouth beyond\
      \ measure,\nand the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down,\n\
      \    her revelers and he who exults in her.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Man is humbled, and each one is brought low,\n    and the eyes of the\
      \ haughty are brought low.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice,\n    and the Holy God shows\
      \ himself holy in righteousness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture,\n    and nomads shall\
      \ eat among the ruins of the rich. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,\n    who draw\
      \ sin as with cart ropes,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ who say: “Let him be quick,\n    let him speed his work\n    that we may\
      \ see it;\nlet the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near,\n    and let\
      \ it come, that we may know it!”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Woe to those who call evil good\n    and good evil,\nwho put darkness\
      \ for light\n    and light for darkness,\nwho put bitter for sweet\n    and\
      \ sweet for bitter!\n"
    21: "²¹ Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,\n    and shrewd in their\
      \ own sight!\n"
    22: "²² Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,\n    and valiant men in\
      \ mixing strong drink,\n"
    23: "²³ who acquit the guilty for a bribe,\n    and deprive the innocent of his\
      \ right! \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,\n    and as dry\
      \ grass sinks down in the flame,\nso their root will be as rottenness,\n   \
      \ and their blossom go up like dust;\nfor they have rejected the law of the\
      \ Lord of hosts,\n    and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people,\n    and\
      \ he stretched out his hand against them and struck them,\n    and the mountains\
      \ quaked;\nand their corpses were as refuse\n    in the midst of the streets.\n\
      For all this his anger has not turned away,\n    and his hand is stretched out\
      \ still. \n"
    26: "²⁶ He will raise a signal for nations far away,\n    and whistle for them\
      \ from the ends of the earth;\nand behold, quickly, speedily they come!\n"
    27: "²⁷ None is weary, none stumbles,\n    none slumbers or sleeps,\nnot a waistband\
      \ is loose,\n    not a sandal strap broken;\n"
    28: "²⁸ their arrows are sharp,\n    all their bows bent,\ntheir horses' hoofs\
      \ seem like flint,\n    and their wheels like the whirlwind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Their roaring is like a lion,\n    like young lions they roar;\nthey growl\
      \ and seize their prey;\n    they carry it off, and none can rescue.\n"
    30: "³⁰ They will growl over it on that day,\n    like the growling of the sea.\n\
      And if one looks to the land,\n    behold, darkness and distress;\nand the light\
      \ is darkened by its clouds."
  6:
    1: '¹ In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne,
      high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. '
    2: '² Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his
      face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. '
    3: "³ And one called to another and said:\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;\n\
      the whole earth is full of his glory!” \n"
    4: '⁴ And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called,
      and the house was filled with smoke. '
    5: "⁵ And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and\
      \ I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the\
      \ King, the Lord of hosts!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that
      he had taken with tongs from the altar. '
    7: "⁷ And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your\
      \ guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.” \n"
    8: '⁸ And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will
      go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.” '
    9: "⁹ And he said, “Go, and say to this people:\n“‘Keep on hearing, but do not\
      \ understand;\nkeep on seeing, but do not perceive.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Make the heart of this people dull,\n    and their ears heavy,\n    and\
      \ blind their eyes;\nlest they see with their eyes,\n    and hear with their\
      \ ears,\nand understand with their hearts,\n    and turn and be healed.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “How long, O Lord?”\nAnd he said:\n“Until cities lie waste\n\
      \    without inhabitant,\nand houses without people,\n    and the land is a\
      \ desolate waste,\n"
    12: "¹² and the Lord removes people far away,\n    and the forsaken places are\
      \ many in the midst of the land.\n"
    13: "¹³ And though a tenth remain in it,\n    it will be burned again,\nlike a\
      \ terebinth or an oak,\n    whose stump remains\n    when it is felled.”\nThe\
      \ holy seed is its stump."
  7:
    1: '¹ In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin
      the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to
      Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against
      it. '
    2: "² When the house of David was told, “Syria is in league with Ephraim,” the\
      \ heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest\
      \ shake before the wind. \n"
    3: "³ And the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub\
      \ your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the\
      \ Washer's Field. "
    4: '⁴ And say to him, ‘Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your
      heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the
      fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against
      you, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves,
      and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” '
    7: "⁷ thus says the Lord God:\n“‘It shall not stand,\n    and it shall not come\
      \ to pass.\n"
    8: "⁸ For the head of Syria is Damascus,\n    and the head of Damascus is Rezin.\n\
      And within sixty-five years\n    Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.\n"
    9: "⁹ And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,\n    and the head of Samaria is the\
      \ son of Remaliah.\nIf you are not firm in faith,\n    you will not be firm\
      \ at all.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz: '
    11: '¹¹ “Ask a sign of the Lord your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” '
    12: '¹² But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.” '
    13: '¹³ And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to
      weary men, that you weary my God also? '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall
      conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. '
    15: '¹⁵ He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and
      choose the good. '
    16: '¹⁶ For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the
      land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. '
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's\
      \ house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from\
      \ Judah—the king of Assyria!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ In that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the
      streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. '
    19: "¹⁹ And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts\
      \ of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. \n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the\
      \ River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will\
      \ sweep away the beard also. \n"
    21: '²¹ In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, '
    22: "²² and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds,\
      \ for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey. \n"
    23: '²³ In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth
      a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns. '
    24: '²⁴ With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers
      and thorns. '
    25: ²⁵ And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not
      come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where
      cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Take a large tablet and write on it in common
      characters, ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’ '
    2: "² And I will get reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son\
      \ of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.” \n"
    3: '³ And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the
      Lord said to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz; '
    4: "⁴ for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth\
      \ of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king\
      \ of Assyria.” \n"
    5: '⁵ The Lord spoke to me again: '
    6: '⁶ “Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently,
      and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, '
    7: '⁷ therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the
      River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise
      over all its channels and go over all its banks, '
    8: "⁸ and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching\
      \ even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land,\
      \ O Immanuel.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered;\n    give ear, all you far countries;\n\
      strap on your armor and be shattered;\n    strap on your armor and be shattered.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing;\n    speak a word,\
      \ but it will not stand,\n    for God is with us. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the Lord spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned
      me not to walk in the way of this people, saying: '
    12: '¹² “Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do
      not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. '
    13: '¹³ But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear,
      and let him be your dread. '
    14: '¹⁴ And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling
      to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    15: "¹⁵ And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall\
      \ be snared and taken.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples. '
    17: '¹⁷ I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob,
      and I will hope in him. '
    18: '¹⁸ Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and portents
      in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion. '
    19: '¹⁹ And when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers
      who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they
      inquire of the dead on behalf of the living? '
    20: '²⁰ To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according
      to this word, it is because they have no dawn. '
    21: '²¹ They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when
      they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against
      their king and their God, and turn their faces upward. '
    22: ²² And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the
      gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.
  9:
    1: "¹ But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time\
      \ he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but\
      \ in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond\
      \ the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. \n"
    2: "²  The people who walked in darkness\n    have seen a great light;\nthose\
      \ who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,\n    on them has light shone.\n"
    3: "³ You have multiplied the nation;\n    you have increased its joy;\nthey rejoice\
      \ before you\n    as with joy at the harvest,\n    as they are glad when they\
      \ divide the spoil.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the yoke of his burden,\n    and the staff for his shoulder,\n    the\
      \ rod of his oppressor,\n    you have broken as on the day of Midian.\n"
    5: "⁵ For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult\n    and every garment\
      \ rolled in blood\n    will be burned as fuel for the fire.\n"
    6: "⁶ For to us a child is born,\n    to us a son is given;\nand the government\
      \ shall be upon his shoulder,\n    and his name shall be called\nWonderful Counselor,\
      \ Mighty God,\n    Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n"
    7: "⁷ Of the increase of his government and of peace\n    there will be no end,\n\
      on the throne of David and over his kingdom,\n    to establish it and to uphold\
      \ it\nwith justice and with righteousness\n    from this time forth and forevermore.\n\
      The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,\n    and it will fall on Israel;\n"
    9: "⁹ and all the people will know,\n    Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria,\n\
      \    who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “The bricks have fallen,\n    but we will build with dressed stones;\n\
      the sycamores have been cut down,\n    but we will put cedars in their place.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ But the Lord raises the adversaries of Rezin against him,\n    and stirs\
      \ up his enemies.\n"
    12: "¹² The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west\n    devour Israel\
      \ with open mouth.\nFor all this his anger has not turned away,\n    and his\
      \ hand is stretched out still. \n"
    13: "¹³ The people did not turn to him who struck them,\n    nor inquire of the\
      \ Lord of hosts.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ So the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail,\n    palm branch and reed\
      \ in one day—\n"
    15: "¹⁵ the elder and honored man is the head,\n    and the prophet who teaches\
      \ lies is the tail;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ for those who guide this people have been leading them astray,\n    and\
      \ those who are guided by them are swallowed up.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men,\n    and has\
      \ no compassion on their fatherless and widows;\nfor everyone is godless and\
      \ an evildoer,\n    and every mouth speaks folly.\nFor all this his anger has\
      \ not turned away,\n    and his hand is stretched out still. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For wickedness burns like a fire;\n    it consumes briers and thorns;\n\
      it kindles the thickets of the forest,\n    and they roll upward in a column\
      \ of smoke.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts\n    the land is scorched,\nand\
      \ the people are like fuel for the fire;\n    no one spares another.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry,\n    and they devour\
      \ on the left, but are not satisfied;\neach devours the flesh of his own arm,\n"
    21: "²¹ Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh;\n    together\
      \ they are against Judah.\nFor all this his anger has not turned away,\n   \
      \ and his hand is stretched out still."
  10:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees,\n    and the writers who keep\
      \ writing oppression,\n"
    2: "² to turn aside the needy from justice\n    and to rob the poor of my people\

    3: "³ What will you do on the day of punishment,\n    in the ruin that will come\
      \ from afar?\nTo whom will you flee for help,\n    and where will you leave\
      \ your wealth?\n"
    4: "⁴ Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners\n    or fall among the\
      \ slain.\nFor all this his anger has not turned away,\n    and his hand is stretched\
      \ out still. \n"
    5: "⁵ Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger;\n    the staff in their hands is my\
      \ fury!\n"
    6: "⁶ Against a godless nation I send him,\n    and against the people of my wrath\
      \ I command him,\nto take spoil and seize plunder,\n    and to tread them down\
      \ like the mire of the streets.\n"
    7: "⁷ But he does not so intend,\n    and his heart does not so think;\nbut it\
      \ is in his heart to destroy,\n    and to cut off nations not a few;\n"
    8: "⁸ for he says:\n“Are not my commanders all kings?\n"
    9: "⁹ Is not Calno like Carchemish?\n    Is not Hamath like Arpad?\n    Is not\
      \ Samaria like Damascus?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols,\n    whose carved\
      \ images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,\n"
    11: "¹¹ shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols\n    as I have done to Samaria\
      \ and her images?” \n"
    12: '¹² When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem,
      he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the
      boastful look in his eyes. '
    13: "¹³ For he says:\n“By the strength of my hand I have done it,\n    and by\
      \ my wisdom, for I have understanding;\nI remove the boundaries of peoples,\n\
      \    and plunder their treasures;\n    like a bull I bring down those who sit\

    14: "¹⁴ My hand has found like a nest\n    the wealth of the peoples;\nand as\
      \ one gathers eggs that have been forsaken,\n    so I have gathered all the\
      \ earth;\nand there was none that moved a wing\n    or opened the mouth or chirped.”\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it,\n    or the saw magnify\
      \ itself against him who wields it?\nAs if a rod should wield him who lifts\
      \ it,\n    or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore the Lord God of hosts\n    will send wasting sickness among\
      \ his stout warriors,\nand under his glory a burning will be kindled,\n    like\
      \ the burning of fire.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The light of Israel will become a fire,\n    and his Holy One a flame,\n\
      and it will burn and devour\n    his thorns and briers in one day.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land\n    the Lord will destroy,\

    20: '²⁰ In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob
      will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the Lord, the Holy
      One of Israel, in truth. '
    21: '²¹ A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. '
    22: '²² For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant
      of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness. '
    23: "²³ For the Lord God of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst\
      \ of all the earth. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: “O my people, who dwell in
      Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift
      up their staff against you as the Egyptians did. '
    25: '²⁵ For in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will
      be directed to their destruction. '
    26: '²⁶ And the Lord of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck
      Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will
      lift it as he did in Egypt. '

    13: "¹³ And the word of the Lord will be to them\nprecept upon precept, precept\
      \ upon precept,\n    line upon line, line upon line,\n    here a little, there\
      \ a little,\nthat they may go, and fall backward,\n    and be broken, and snared,\

    14: "¹⁴ Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers,\n    who rule this\
      \ people in Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,\n    and with\

    19: "¹⁹ As often as it passes through it will take you;\n    for morning by morning\

    20: "²⁰ For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on,\n    and the covering\

      \ work his work—alien is his work!\n"
    22: "²² Now therefore do not scoff,\n    lest your bonds be made strong;\nfor\

    26: "²⁶ For he is rightly instructed;\n    his God teaches him. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,\n    nor is a cart wheel\

    28: "²⁸ Does one crush grain for bread?\n    No, he does not thresh it forever;\n\

    7: "⁷ And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,\n    all\

    11: '¹¹ And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book

      says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” '
    12: "¹² And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,”\

    17: "¹⁷ A thousand shall flee at the threat of one;\n    at the threat of five\

      \ “Be gone!” \n"
    23: '²³ And he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and
      bread, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. In that

    29: '²⁹ You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness
      of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain
      of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel. '
    30: '³⁰ And the Lord will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending
      blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire,

    31: '³¹ The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the Lord, when he
      strikes with his rod. '
    32: '³² And every stroke of the appointed staff that the Lord lays on them will
      be to the sound of tambourines and lyres. Battling with brandished arm, he will
      fight with them. '
    33: ³³ For a burning place has long been prepared; indeed, for the king it is
      made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the
      breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
  31:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help\n    and rely on horses,\nwho\

    4: "⁴ For thus the Lord said to me,\n“As a lion or a young lion growls over his\

    6: '⁶ Turn to him from whom people have deeply revolted, O children of Israel. '
    7: "⁷ For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols\

  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came
      up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. '
    2: "² And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah\
      \ at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper\
      \ pool on the highway to the Washer's Field. "
    3: "³ And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,\
      \ and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder. \n"
    4: '⁴ And the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king,
      the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours? '
    5: '⁵ Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do
      you now trust, that you have rebelled against me? '
    6: '⁶ Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will
      pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to
      all who trust in him. '
    7: '⁷ But if you say to me, “We trust in the Lord our God,” is it not he whose
      high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem,
      “You shall worship before this altar”? '
    8: '⁸ Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you
      two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. '
    9: "⁹ How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's\
      \ servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? "
    10: "¹⁰ Moreover, is it without the Lord that I have come up against this land\
      \ to destroy it? The Lord said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it.”’”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to
      your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language
      of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” '
    12: "¹² But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to\
      \ your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed\
      \ with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language
      of Judah: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! '
    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not
      be able to deliver you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord by saying, “The Lord will
      surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of
      Assyria.” '
    16: '¹⁶ Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your
      peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine,
      and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of
      his own cistern, '
    17: '¹⁷ until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
      grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. '
    18: '¹⁸ Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, “The Lord will deliver us.”
      Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the
      king of Assyria? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
      Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? '
    20: "²⁰ Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of\
      \ my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’” \n"
    21: "²¹ But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command\
      \ was, “Do not answer him.” "
    22: ²² Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna
      the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with
      their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
  37:
    1: '¹ As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself
      with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord. '
    2: '² And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary,
      and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son
      of Amoz. '
    3: '³ They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, of
      rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there
      is no strength to bring them forth. '
    4: "⁴ It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom\
      \ his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke\
      \ the words that the Lord your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer\
      \ for the remnant that is left.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, '
    6: '⁶ Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: Do not be
      afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of
      the king of Assyria have reviled me. '
    7: "⁷ Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return\
      \ to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah,
      for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. '
    9: '⁹ Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has set out to
      fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God
      in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given
      into the hand of the king of Assyria. '
    11: '¹¹ Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands,
      devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered? '
    12: '¹² Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers
      destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? '
    13: "¹³ Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of\
      \ Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read
      it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the
      Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord: '
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are
      the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and
      earth. '
    17: '¹⁷ Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and
      hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. '
    18: '¹⁸ Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and
      their lands, '
    19: "¹⁹ and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the\
      \ work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. "
    20: "²⁰ So now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of\
      \ the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the Lord,
      the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king
      of Assyria, '
    22: "²² this is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him:\n“‘She despises\
      \ you, she scorns you—\n    the virgin daughter of Zion;\nshe wags her head\

      \ of Israel!\n"
    24: "²⁴ By your servants you have mocked the Lord,\n    and you have said, With\
      \ my many chariots\nI have gone up the heights of the mountains,\n    to the\
      \ far recesses of Lebanon,\nto cut down its tallest cedars,\n    its choicest\
      \ cypresses,\nto come to its remotest height,\n    its most fruitful forest.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I dug wells\n    and drank waters,\nto dry up with the sole of my foot\n\

    27: "²⁷ while their inhabitants, shorn of strength,\n    are dismayed and confounded,\n\
      and have become like plants of the field\n    and like tender grass,\nlike grass\
      \ on the housetops,\n    blighted before it is grown. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “‘I know your sitting down\n    and your going out and coming in,\n  \
      \  and your raging against me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because you have raged against me\n    and your complacency has come to\
      \ my ears,\nI will put my hook in your nose\n    and my bit in your mouth,\n\

    30: '³⁰ “And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows
      of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third
      year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. '
    31: '³¹ And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root
      downward and bear fruit upward. '
    32: "³² For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band\
      \ of survivors. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. \n"
    33: '³³ “Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall
      not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield
      or cast up a siege mound against it. '
    34: '³⁴ By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not
      come into this city, declares the Lord. '
    35: "³⁵ For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake\

    36: '³⁶ And the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp
      of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these
      were all dead bodies. '
    37: '³⁷ Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived
      at Nineveh. '
    38: ³⁸ And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and
      Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into
      the land of Ararat, Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
  38:
    1: '¹ In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah
      the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the Lord:

    2: '² Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, '
    3: "³ and said, “Please, O Lord, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness\
      \ and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah\

    9: "⁹ A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered\
      \ from his sickness: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I said, In the middle of my days\n    I must depart;\nI am consigned to\

    11: "¹¹ I said, I shall not see the Lord,\n    the Lord in the land of the living;\n\

    21: '²¹ Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the
      boil, that he may recover.” '
    22: ²² Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house
      of the Lord?”
  39:
    1: '¹ At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
      envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been
      sick and had recovered. '
    2: '² And Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. And he showed them his treasure house,
      the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that
      was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm
      that Hezekiah did not show them. '
    3: '³ Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did
      these men say? And from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have
      come to me from a far country, from Babylon.” '
    4: "⁴ He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have\
      \ seen all that is in my house. There is nothing in my storehouses that I did\

    5: '⁵ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: '

      your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing

    17: "¹⁷ Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry,\n    I struck\

    5: "⁵ Is such the fast that I choose,\n    a day for a person to humble himself?\n\

    16: "¹⁶ He saw that there was no man,\n    and wondered that there was no one\

      \ upheld him.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He put on righteousness as a breastplate,\n    and a helmet of salvation\

    18: "¹⁸ Your holy people held possession for a little while;\n    our adversaries\
      \ have trampled down your sanctuary.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ We have become like those over whom you have never ruled,\n    like those\
      \ who are not called by your name."
  64:
    1: "¹ Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,\n    that the mountains\
      \ might quake at your presence—\n"
    2: "²  as when fire kindles brushwood\n    and the fire causes water to boil—\n\
      to make your name known to your adversaries,\n    and that the nations might\
      \ tremble at your presence!\n"
    3: "³ When you did awesome things that we did not look for,\n    you came down,\
      \ the mountains quaked at your presence.\n"
    4: "⁴ From of old no one has heard\n    or perceived by the ear,\nno eye has seen\
      \ a God besides you,\n    who acts for those who wait for him.\n"
    5: "⁵ You meet him who joyfully works righteousness,\n    those who remember you\
      \ in your ways.\nBehold, you were angry, and we sinned;\n    in our sins we\
      \ have been a long time, and shall we be saved?\n"
    6: "⁶ We have all become like one who is unclean,\n    and all our righteous deeds\
      \ are like a polluted garment.\nWe all fade like a leaf,\n    and our iniquities,\
      \ like the wind, take us away.\n"
    7: "⁷ There is no one who calls upon your name,\n    who rouses himself to take\
      \ hold of you;\nfor you have hidden your face from us,\n    and have made us\
      \ melt in the hand of our iniquities. \n"
    8: "⁸ But now, O Lord, you are our Father;\n    we are the clay, and you are our\
      \ potter;\n    we are all the work of your hand.\n"
    9: "⁹ Be not so terribly angry, O Lord,\n    and remember not iniquity forever.\n\
      \    Behold, please look, we are all your people.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Your holy cities have become a wilderness;\n    Zion has become a wilderness,\n\
      \    Jerusalem a desolation.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Our holy and beautiful house,\n    where our fathers praised you,\nhas\
      \ been burned by fire,\n    and all our pleasant places have become ruins.\n"
    12: "¹² Will you restrain yourself at these things, O Lord?\n    Will you keep\
      \ silent, and afflict us so terribly?"
  65:
    1: "¹ I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me;\n    I was ready\
      \ to be found by those who did not seek me.\nI said, “Here I am, here I am,”\n\
      \    to a nation that was not called by my name.\n"
    2: "² I spread out my hands all the day\n    to a rebellious people,\nwho walk\
      \ in a way that is not good,\n    following their own devices;\n"
    3: "³ a people who provoke me\n    to my face continually,\nsacrificing in gardens\n\
      \    and making offerings on bricks;\n"
    4: "⁴ who sit in tombs,\n    and spend the night in secret places;\nwho eat pig's\
      \ flesh,\n    and broth of tainted meat is in their vessels;\n"
    5: "⁵ who say, “Keep to yourself,\n    do not come near me, for I am too holy\
      \ for you.”\nThese are a smoke in my nostrils,\n    a fire that burns all the\
      \ day.\n"
    6: "⁶ Behold, it is written before me:\n    “I will not keep silent, but I will\
      \ repay;\nI will indeed repay into their lap\n"
    7: "⁷     both your iniquities and your fathers' iniquities together,\nsays the\
      \ Lord;\nbecause they made offerings on the mountains\n    and insulted me on\
      \ the hills,\nI will measure into their lap\n    payment for their former deeds.”\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Thus says the Lord:\n“As the new wine is found in the cluster,\n    and\
      \ they say, ‘Do not destroy it,\n    for there is a blessing in it,’\nso I will\
      \ do for my servants' sake,\n    and not destroy them all.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bring forth offspring from Jacob,\n    and from Judah possessors\
      \ of my mountains;\nmy chosen shall possess it,\n    and my servants shall dwell\
      \ there.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks,\n    and the Valley of Achor\
      \ a place for herds to lie down,\n    for my people who have sought me.\n"
    11: "¹¹ But you who forsake the Lord,\n    who forget my holy mountain,\nwho set\
      \ a table for Fortune\n    and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,\n"
    12: "¹² I will destine you to the sword,\n    and all of you shall bow down to\
      \ the slaughter,\nbecause, when I called, you did not answer;\n    when I spoke,\
      \ you did not listen,\nbut you did what was evil in my eyes\n    and chose what\
      \ I did not delight in.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n“Behold, my servants shall eat,\n \
      \   but you shall be hungry;\nbehold, my servants shall drink,\n    but you\
      \ shall be thirsty;\nbehold, my servants shall rejoice,\n    but you shall be\
      \ put to shame;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart,\n    but you shall\
      \ cry out for pain of heart\n    and shall wail for breaking of spirit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse,\n    and the Lord\
      \ God will put you to death,\n    but his servants he will call by another name,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ so that he who blesses himself in the land\n    shall bless himself by\
      \ the God of truth,\nand he who takes an oath in the land\n    shall swear by\
      \ the God of truth;\nbecause the former troubles are forgotten\n    and are\
      \ hidden from my eyes. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “For behold, I create new heavens\n    and a new earth,\nand the former\
      \ things shall not be remembered\n    or come into mind.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But be glad and rejoice forever\n    in that which I create;\nfor behold,\
      \ I create Jerusalem to be a joy,\n    and her people to be a gladness.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will rejoice in Jerusalem\n    and be glad in my people;\nno more shall\
      \ be heard in it the sound of weeping\n    and the cry of distress.\n"
    20: "²⁰ No more shall there be in it\n    an infant who lives but a few days,\n\
      \    or an old man who does not fill out his days,\nfor the young man shall\
      \ die a hundred years old,\n    and the sinner a hundred years old shall be\
      \ accursed.\n"
    21: "²¹ They shall build houses and inhabit them;\n    they shall plant vineyards\
      \ and eat their fruit.\n"
    22: "²² They shall not build and another inhabit;\n    they shall not plant and\
      \ another eat;\nfor like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,\n\
      \    and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\n"
    23: "²³ They shall not labor in vain\n    or bear children for calamity,\nfor\
      \ they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the Lord,\n    and their descendants\
      \ with them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Before they call I will answer;\n    while they are yet speaking I will\
      \ hear.\n"
    25: "²⁵ The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;\n    the lion shall eat straw\
      \ like the ox,\n    and dust shall be the serpent's food.\nThey shall not hurt\
      \ or destroy\n    in all my holy mountain,”\nsays the Lord."
  66:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“Heaven is my throne,\n    and the earth is my footstool;\n\
      what is the house that you would build for me,\n    and what is the place of\
      \ my rest?\n"
    2: "² All these things my hand has made,\n    and so all these things came to\
      \ be,\ndeclares the Lord.\nBut this is the one to whom I will look:\n    he\
      \ who is humble and contrite in spirit\n    and trembles at my word. \n"
    3: "³ “He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man;\n    he who sacrifices\
      \ a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck;\nhe who presents a grain offering,\
      \ like one who offers pig's blood;\n    he who makes a memorial offering of\
      \ frankincense, like one who blesses an idol.\nThese have chosen their own ways,\n\
      \    and their soul delights in their abominations;\n"
    4: "⁴ I also will choose harsh treatment for them\n    and bring their fears upon\
      \ them,\nbecause when I called, no one answered,\n    when I spoke, they did\
      \ not listen;\nbut they did what was evil in my eyes\n    and chose that in\
      \ which I did not delight.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Hear the word of the Lord,\n    you who tremble at his word:\n“Your brothers\
      \ who hate you\n    and cast you out for my name's sake\nhave said, ‘Let the\
      \ Lord be glorified,\n    that we may see your joy’;\n    but it is they who\
      \ shall be put to shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ “The sound of an uproar from the city!\n    A sound from the temple!\nThe\
      \ sound of the Lord,\n    rendering recompense to his enemies! \n"
    7: "⁷ “Before she was in labor\n    she gave birth;\nbefore her pain came upon\
      \ her\n    she delivered a son.\n"
    8: "⁸ Who has heard such a thing?\n    Who has seen such things?\nShall a land\
      \ be born in one day?\n    Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment?\n\
      For as soon as Zion was in labor\n    she brought forth her children.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?”\n   \
      \ says the Lord;\n“shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?”\n    says\
      \ your God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her,\n    all you who love her;\n\
      rejoice with her in joy,\n    all you who mourn over her;\n"
    11: "¹¹ that you may nurse and be satisfied\n    from her consoling breast;\n\
      that you may drink deeply with delight\n    from her glorious abundance.” \n"
    12: "¹² For thus says the Lord:\n“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,\n\
      \    and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;\nand you shall\
      \ nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip,\n    and bounced upon her knees.\n"
    13: "¹³ As one whom his mother comforts,\n    so I will comfort you;\n    you\
      \ shall be comforted in Jerusalem.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice;\n    your bones shall flourish\
      \ like the grass;\nand the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants,\n\
      \    and he shall show his indignation against his enemies. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “For behold, the Lord will come in fire,\n    and his chariots like the\
      \ whirlwind,\nto render his anger in fury,\n    and his rebuke with flames of\
      \ fire.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For by fire will the Lord enter into judgment,\n    and by his sword,\
      \ with all flesh;\n    and those slain by the Lord shall be many. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following\
      \ one in the midst, eating pig's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come\
      \ to an end together, declares the Lord. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to
      gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory, '
    19: '¹⁹ and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors
      to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan,
      to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And
      they shall declare my glory among the nations. '
    20: '²⁰ And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering
      to the Lord, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries,
      to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, just as the Israelites bring their
      grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord. '
    21: "²¹ And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the\
