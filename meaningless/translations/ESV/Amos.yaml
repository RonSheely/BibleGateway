Amos:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning\
      \ Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the\
      \ son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. \n"
    2: "² And he said:\n“The Lord roars from Zion\n    and utters his voice from Jerusalem;\n\
      the pastures of the shepherds mourn,\n    and the top of Carmel withers.” \n"
    3: "³ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Damascus,\n    and for\
      \ four, I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause they have threshed Gilead\n\
      \    with threshing sledges of iron.\n"
    4: "⁴ So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael,\n    and it shall devour\
      \ the strongholds of Ben-hadad.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will break the gate-bar of Damascus,\n    and cut off the inhabitants\
      \ from the Valley of Aven,\nand him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden;\n\
      \    and the people of Syria shall go into exile to Kir,”\nsays the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Gaza,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause they carried into exile a whole\
      \ people\n    to deliver them up to Edom.\n"
    7: "⁷ So I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza,\n    and it shall devour her\
      \ strongholds.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod,\n    and him who holds the scepter\
      \ from Ashkelon;\nI will turn my hand against Ekron,\n    and the remnant of\
      \ the Philistines shall perish,”\nsays the Lord God. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Tyre,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause they delivered up a whole people\
      \ to Edom,\n    and did not remember the covenant of brotherhood.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ So I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre,\n    and it shall devour\
      \ her strongholds.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Edom,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause he pursued his brother with the\
      \ sword\n    and cast off all pity,\nand his anger tore perpetually,\n    and\
      \ he kept his wrath forever.\n"
    12: "¹² So I will send a fire upon Teman,\n    and it shall devour the strongholds\
      \ of Bozrah.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of the Ammonites,\n   \
      \ and for four, I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause they have ripped\
      \ open pregnant women in Gilead,\n    that they might enlarge their border.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ So I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,\n    and it shall devour\
      \ her strongholds,\nwith shouting on the day of battle,\n    with a tempest\
      \ in the day of the whirlwind;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ and their king shall go into exile,\n    he and his princes together,”\n\
      says the Lord."
  2:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Moab,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause he burned to lime\n    the bones\
      \ of the king of Edom.\n"
    2: "² So I will send a fire upon Moab,\n    and it shall devour the strongholds\
      \ of Kerioth,\nand Moab shall die amid uproar,\n    amid shouting and the sound\
      \ of the trumpet;\n"
    3: "³ I will cut off the ruler from its midst,\n    and will kill all its princes\
      \ with him,”\nsays the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Judah,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause they have rejected the law of the\
      \ Lord,\n    and have not kept his statutes,\nbut their lies have led them astray,\n\
      \    those after which their fathers walked.\n"
    5: "⁵ So I will send a fire upon Judah,\n    and it shall devour the strongholds\
      \ of Jerusalem.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Israel,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment,\nbecause they sell the righteous for silver,\n\
      \    and the needy for a pair of sandals—\n"
    7: "⁷ those who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth\n    and\
      \ turn aside the way of the afflicted;\na man and his father go in to the same\
      \ girl,\n    so that my holy name is profaned;\n"
    8: "⁸ they lay themselves down beside every altar\n    on garments taken in pledge,\n\
      and in the house of their God they drink\n    the wine of those who have been\
      \ fined. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,\n    whose height was\
      \ like the height of the cedars\n    and who was as strong as the oaks;\nI destroyed\
      \ his fruit above\n    and his roots beneath.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Also it was I who brought you up out of the land of Egypt\n    and led\
      \ you forty years in the wilderness,\n    to possess the land of the Amorite.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And I raised up some of your sons for prophets,\n    and some of your\
      \ young men for Nazirites.\n    Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?”\n\
      declares the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² “But you made the Nazirites drink wine,\n    and commanded the prophets,\n\
      \    saying, ‘You shall not prophesy.’ \n"
    13: "¹³ “Behold, I will press you down in your place,\n    as a cart full of sheaves\
      \ presses down.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Flight shall perish from the swift,\n    and the strong shall not retain\
      \ his strength,\n    nor shall the mighty save his life;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ he who handles the bow shall not stand,\n    and he who is swift of foot\
      \ shall not save himself,\n    nor shall he who rides the horse save his life;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ and he who is stout of heart among the mighty\n    shall flee away naked\
      \ in that day,”\ndeclares the Lord."
  3:
    1: "¹ Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O people of Israel,\
      \ against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt: \n"
    2: "² “You only have I known\n    of all the families of the earth;\ntherefore\
      \ I will punish you\n    for all your iniquities. \n"
    3: "³ “Do two walk together,\n    unless they have agreed to meet?\n"
    4: "⁴ Does a lion roar in the forest,\n    when he has no prey?\nDoes a young\
      \ lion cry out from his den,\n    if he has taken nothing?\n"
    5: "⁵ Does a bird fall in a snare on the earth,\n    when there is no trap for\
      \ it?\nDoes a snare spring up from the ground,\n    when it has taken nothing?\n"
    6: "⁶ Is a trumpet blown in a city,\n    and the people are not afraid?\nDoes\
      \ disaster come to a city,\n    unless the Lord has done it? \n"
    7: "⁷ “For the Lord God does nothing\n    without revealing his secret\n    to\
      \ his servants the prophets.\n"
    8: "⁸ The lion has roared;\n    who will not fear?\nThe Lord God has spoken;\n\
      \    who can but prophesy?” \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim to the strongholds in Ashdod\n    and to the strongholds in the\
      \ land of Egypt,\nand say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,\n\
      \    and see the great tumults within her,\n    and the oppressed in her midst.”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “They do not know how to do right,” declares the Lord,\n    “those who\
      \ store up violence and robbery in their strongholds.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n“An adversary shall surround the land\n\
      \    and bring down your defenses from you,\n    and your strongholds shall\
      \ be plundered.” \n"
    12: "¹² Thus says the Lord: “As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion\
      \ two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the people of Israel who dwell in\
      \ Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part of a bed. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob,”\n    declares the Lord\
      \ God, the God of hosts,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions,\n    I will punish\
      \ the altars of Bethel,\nand the horns of the altar shall be cut off\n    and\
      \ fall to the ground.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will strike the winter house along with the summer house,\n    and the\
      \ houses of ivory shall perish,\nand the great houses shall come to an end,”\n\
      declares the Lord."
  4:
    1: "¹ “Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,\n    who are on the mountain of Samaria,\n\
      who oppress the poor, who crush the needy,\n    who say to your husbands, ‘Bring,\
      \ that we may drink!’\n"
    2: "² The Lord God has sworn by his holiness\n    that, behold, the days are coming\
      \ upon you,\nwhen they shall take you away with hooks,\n    even the last of\
      \ you with fishhooks.\n"
    3: "³ And you shall go out through the breaches,\n    each one straight ahead;\n\
      \    and you shall be cast out into Harmon,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Come to Bethel, and transgress;\n    to Gilgal, and multiply transgression;\n\
      bring your sacrifices every morning,\n    your tithes every three days;\n"
    5: "⁵ offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,\n    and proclaim\
      \ freewill offerings, publish them;\n    for so you love to do, O people of\
      \ Israel!”\ndeclares the Lord God. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\n    and lack of bread\
      \ in all your places,\nyet you did not return to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    7: "⁷ “I also withheld the rain from you\n    when there were yet three months\
      \ to the harvest;\nI would send rain on one city,\n    and send no rain on another\
      \ city;\none field would have rain,\n    and the field on which it did not rain\
      \ would wither;\n"
    8: "⁸ so two or three cities would wander to another city\n    to drink water,\
      \ and would not be satisfied;\nyet you did not return to me,”\ndeclares the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ “I struck you with blight and mildew;\n    your many gardens and your vineyards,\n\
      \    your fig trees and your olive trees the locust devoured;\nyet you did not\
      \ return to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “I sent among you a pestilence after the manner of Egypt;\n    I killed\
      \ your young men with the sword,\nand carried away your horses,\n    and I made\
      \ the stench of your camp go up into your nostrils;\nyet you did not return\
      \ to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “I overthrew some of you,\n    as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,\n\
      \    and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning;\nyet you did not return\
      \ to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel;\n    because I will do this\
      \ to you,\n    prepare to meet your God, O Israel!” \n"
    13: "¹³ For behold, he who forms the mountains and creates the wind,\n    and\
      \ declares to man what is his thought,\nwho makes the morning darkness,\n  \
      \  and treads on the heights of the earth—\n    the Lord, the God of hosts,\
      \ is his name!"
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this word that I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² “Fallen, no more to rise,\n    is the virgin Israel;\nforsaken on her land,\n\
      \    with none to raise her up.” \n"
    3: "³ For thus says the Lord God:\n“The city that went out a thousand\n    shall\
      \ have a hundred left,\nand that which went out a hundred\n    shall have ten\
      \ left\n    to the house of Israel.” \n"
    4: "⁴ For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel:\n“Seek me and live;\n"
    5: "⁵     but do not seek Bethel,\nand do not enter into Gilgal\n    or cross\
      \ over to Beersheba;\nfor Gilgal shall surely go into exile,\n    and Bethel\
      \ shall come to nothing.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Seek the Lord and live,\n    lest he break out like fire in the house of\
      \ Joseph,\n    and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,\n"
    7: "⁷ O you who turn justice to wormwood\n    and cast down righteousness to the\
      \ earth! \n"
    8: "⁸ He who made the Pleiades and Orion,\n    and turns deep darkness into the\
      \ morning\n    and darkens the day into night,\nwho calls for the waters of\
      \ the sea\n    and pours them out on the surface of the earth,\nthe Lord is\
      \ his name;\n"
    9: "⁹ who makes destruction flash forth against the strong,\n    so that destruction\
      \ comes upon the fortress. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They hate him who reproves in the gate,\n    and they abhor him who speaks\
      \ the truth.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore because you trample on the poor\n    and you exact taxes of\
      \ grain from him,\nyou have built houses of hewn stone,\n    but you shall not\
      \ dwell in them;\nyou have planted pleasant vineyards,\n    but you shall not\
      \ drink their wine.\n"
    12: "¹² For I know how many are your transgressions\n    and how great are your\
      \ sins—\nyou who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,\n    and turn aside\
      \ the needy in the gate.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time,\n    for\
      \ it is an evil time. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Seek good, and not evil,\n    that you may live;\nand so the Lord, the\
      \ God of hosts, will be with you,\n    as you have said.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hate evil, and love good,\n    and establish justice in the gate;\nit\
      \ may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,\n    will be gracious to the remnant\
      \ of Joseph. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord:\n“In all the\
      \ squares there shall be wailing,\n    and in all the streets they shall say,\
      \ ‘Alas! Alas!’\nThey shall call the farmers to mourning\n    and to wailing\
      \ those who are skilled in lamentation,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ and in all vineyards there shall be wailing,\n    for I will pass through\
      \ your midst,”\nsays the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord!\n    Why would you have the\
      \ day of the Lord?\nIt is darkness, and not light,\n"
    19: "¹⁹     as if a man fled from a lion,\n    and a bear met him,\nor went into\
      \ the house and leaned his hand against the wall,\n    and a serpent bit him.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light,\n    and gloom with\
      \ no brightness in it? \n"
    21: "²¹ “I hate, I despise your feasts,\n    and I take no delight in your solemn\
      \ assemblies.\n"
    22: "²² Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,\n \
      \   I will not accept them;\nand the peace offerings of your fattened animals,\n\
      \    I will not look upon them.\n"
    23: "²³ Take away from me the noise of your songs;\n    to the melody of your\
      \ harps I will not listen.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But let justice roll down like waters,\n    and righteousness like an\
      \ ever-flowing stream. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in
      the wilderness, O house of Israel? '
    26: '²⁶ You shall take up Sikkuth your king, and Kiyyun your star-god—your images
      that you made for yourselves, '
    27: ²⁷ and I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord, whose name
      is the God of hosts.
  6:
    1: "¹ “Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,\n    and to those who feel secure\
      \ on the mountain of Samaria,\nthe notable men of the first of the nations,\n\

    2: "² Pass over to Calneh, and see,\n    and from there go to Hamath the great;\n\
      \    then go down to Gath of the Philistines.\nAre you better than these kingdoms?\n\
      \    Or is their territory greater than your territory,\n"
    3: "³ O you who put far away the day of disaster\n    and bring near the seat\
      \ of violence? \n"
    4: "⁴ “Woe to those who lie on beds of ivory\n    and stretch themselves out on\
      \ their couches,\nand eat lambs from the flock\n    and calves from the midst\

    5: "⁵ who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp\n    and like David invent\
      \ for themselves instruments of music,\n"
    6: "⁶ who drink wine in bowls\n    and anoint themselves with the finest oils,\n\
      \    but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!\n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore they shall now be the first of those who go into exile,\n    and\
      \ the revelry of those who stretch themselves out shall pass away.” \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord God has sworn by himself, declares the Lord, the God of hosts:\n\
      “I abhor the pride of Jacob\n    and hate his strongholds,\n    and I will deliver\
      \ up the city and all that is in it.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And if ten men remain in one house, they shall die. '
    10: "¹⁰ And when one's relative, the one who anoints him for burial, shall take\

  7:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord God showed me: behold, he was forming locusts when\

    10: '¹⁰ Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying,
      “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land

    12: '¹² And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah,

    6: "⁶ that we may buy the poor for silver\n    and the needy for a pair of sandals\n\
      \    and sell the chaff of the wheat?” \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob:\n“Surely I will never forget any\
      \ of their deeds.\n"
    8: "⁸ Shall not the land tremble on this account,\n    and everyone mourn who\
      \ dwells in it,\nand all of it rise like the Nile,\n    and be tossed about\
      \ and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?” \n"
    9: "⁹ “And on that day,” declares the Lord God,\n    “I will make the sun go down\
      \ at noon\n    and darken the earth in broad daylight.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will turn your feasts into mourning\n    and all your songs into lamentation;\n\
      I will bring sackcloth on every waist\n    and baldness on every head;\nI will\
      \ make it like the mourning for an only son\n    and the end of it like a bitter\
      \ day. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord God,\n    “when I will\
      \ send a famine on the land—\nnot a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,\n\
      \    but of hearing the words of the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² They shall wander from sea to sea,\n    and from north to east;\nthey\
      \ shall run to and fro, to seek the word of the Lord,\n    but they shall not\
      \ find it. \n"
    13: "¹³ “In that day the lovely virgins and the young men\n    shall faint for\
      \ thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Those who swear by the Guilt of Samaria,\n    and say, ‘As your god lives,\
      \ O Dan,’\nand, ‘As the Way of Beersheba lives,’\n    they shall fall, and never\
      \ rise again.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said:\n“Strike the capitals\
      \ until the thresholds shake,\n    and shatter them on the heads of all the\
      \ people;\nand those who are left of them I will kill with the sword;\n    not\
      \ one of them shall flee away;\n    not one of them shall escape. \n"
    2: "² “If they dig into Sheol,\n    from there shall my hand take them;\nif they\
      \ climb up to heaven,\n    from there I will bring them down.\n"
    3: "³ If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,\n    from there I will search\
      \ them out and take them;\nand if they hide from my sight at the bottom of the\
      \ sea,\n    there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\n"
    4: "⁴ And if they go into captivity before their enemies,\n    there I will command\
      \ the sword, and it shall kill them;\nand I will fix my eyes upon them\n   \
      \ for evil and not for good.” \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord God of hosts,\nhe who touches the earth and it melts,\n    and\
      \ all who dwell in it mourn,\nand all of it rises like the Nile,\n    and sinks\
      \ again, like the Nile of Egypt;\n"
    6: "⁶ who builds his upper chambers in the heavens\n    and founds his vault upon\
      \ the earth;\nwho calls for the waters of the sea\n    and pours them out upon\
      \ the surface of the earth—\nthe Lord is his name. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Are you not like the Cushites to me,\n    O people of Israel?” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n“Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt,\n    and the\
      \ Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir?\n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom,\n    and I\
      \ will destroy it from the surface of the ground,\n    except that I will not\
      \ utterly destroy the house of Jacob,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ “For behold, I will command,\n    and shake the house of Israel among all\
      \ the nations\nas one shakes with a sieve,\n    but no pebble shall fall to\
      \ the earth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword,\n    who say, ‘Disaster\
      \ shall not overtake or meet us.’ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “In that day I will raise up\n    the booth of David that is fallen\n\
      and repair its breaches,\n    and raise up its ruins\n    and rebuild it as\
      \ in the days of old,\n"
    12: "¹² that they may possess the remnant of Edom\n    and all the nations who\
      \ are called by my name,”\n    declares the Lord who does this. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,\n    “when the plowman\
      \ shall overtake the reaper\n    and the treader of grapes him who sows the\
      \ seed;\nthe mountains shall drip sweet wine,\n    and all the hills shall flow\
      \ with it.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel,\n    and they shall rebuild\
      \ the ruined cities and inhabit them;\nthey shall plant vineyards and drink\
      \ their wine,\n    and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will plant them on their land,\n    and they shall never again be uprooted\n\
      \    out of the land that I have given them,”\nsays the Lord your God."
