Revelation:
  1:
    1: '¹ The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants
      the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel
      to his servant John, '
    2: '² who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ,
      even to all that he saw. '
    3: "³ Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed\
      \ are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ John to the seven churches that are in Asia:\nGrace to you and peace from\
      \ him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who\
      \ are before his throne, "
    5: "⁵ and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and\
      \ the ruler of kings on earth.\nTo him who loves us and has freed us from our\
      \ sins by his blood "
    6: '⁶ and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and
      dominion forever and ever. Amen. '
    7: "⁷ Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those\
      \ who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him.\
      \ Even so. Amen. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and\
      \ who is to come, the Almighty.” \n"
    9: '⁹ I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and
      the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on
      account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. '
    10: "¹⁰ I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice\
      \ like a trumpet "
    11: "¹¹ saying, “Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches,\
      \ to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and\
      \ to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning
      I saw seven golden lampstands, '
    13: '¹³ and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with
      a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. '
    14: '¹⁴ The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes
      were like a flame of fire, '
    15: '¹⁵ his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice
      was like the roar of many waters. '
    16: "¹⁶ In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged\
      \ sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right
      hand on me, saying, “Fear not, I am the first and the last, '
    18: '¹⁸ and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have
      the keys of Death and Hades. '
    19: '¹⁹ Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those
      that are to take place after this. '
    20: ²⁰ As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and
      the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,
      and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
  2:
    1: "¹ “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of him who holds\
      \ the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² “‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot
      bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles
      and are not, and found them to be false. '
    3: "³ I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and\
      \ you have not grown weary. "
    4: '⁴ But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at
      first. '
    5: '⁵ Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works
      you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from
      its place, unless you repent. '
    6: '⁶ Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. '
    7: "⁷ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To\
      \ the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in\
      \ the paradise of God.’ \n"
    8: "⁸ “And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‘The words of the first\
      \ and the last, who died and came to life. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander
      of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. '
    10: '¹⁰ Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to
      throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you
      will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown
      of life. '
    11: "¹¹ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\
      \ The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.’ \n"
    12: "¹² “And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‘The words of him who\
      \ has the sharp two-edged sword. \n"
    13: "¹³ “‘I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold fast my\
      \ name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful\
      \ witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. "
    14: '¹⁴ But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the
      teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons
      of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual
      immorality. '
    15: '¹⁵ So also you have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore repent. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them
      with the sword of my mouth. '
    17: "¹⁷ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\
      \ To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give\
      \ him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows\
      \ except the one who receives it.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: ‘The words of the Son\
      \ of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished\
      \ bronze. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “‘I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance,
      and that your latter works exceed the first. '
    20: '²⁰ But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who
      calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice
      sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. '
    21: '²¹ I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality. '
    22: '²² Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery
      with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, '
    23: '²³ and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that
      I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according
      to your works. '
    24: '²⁴ But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who
      have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do
      not lay on you any other burden. '
    25: '²⁵ Only hold fast what you have until I come. '
    26: '²⁶ The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will
      give authority over the nations, '
    27: '²⁷ and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken
      in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father. '
    28: '²⁸ And I will give him the morning star. '
    29: ²⁹ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’
  3:
    1: "¹ “And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ‘The words of him who has\
      \ the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.\n“‘I know your works. You have\
      \ the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. "
    2: '² Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not
      found your works complete in the sight of my God. '
    3: '³ Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you
      will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour
      I will come against you. '
    4: '⁴ Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their
      garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy. '
    5: '⁵ The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will
      never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before
      my Father and before his angels. '
    6: "⁶ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ \n"
    7: "⁷ “And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‘The words of the\
      \ holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will\
      \ shut, who shuts and no one opens. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no
      one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have
      kept my word and have not denied my name. '
    9: '⁹ Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are
      Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before
      your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you. '
    10: '¹⁰ Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you
      from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell
      on the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your
      crown. '
    12: '¹² The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God.
      Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and
      the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my
      God out of heaven, and my own new name. '
    13: "¹³ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: ‘The words of the Amen,\
      \ the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were
      either cold or hot! '
    16: '¹⁶ So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you
      out of my mouth. '
    17: '¹⁷ For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing
      that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. '
    18: '¹⁸ I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be
      rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your
      nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. '
    19: '¹⁹ Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent. '
    20: '²⁰ Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens
      the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. '
    21: '²¹ The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as
      I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. '
    22: ²² He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”
  4:
    1: '¹ After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the
      first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up
      here, and I will show you what must take place after this.” '
    2: '² At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with
      one seated on the throne. '
    3: '³ And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around
      the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. '
    4: '⁴ Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were
      twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. '
    5: '⁵ From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder,
      and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven
      spirits of God, '
    6: "⁶ and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.\n\
      And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures,\
      \ full of eyes in front and behind: "
    7: '⁷ the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an
      ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living
      creature like an eagle in flight. '
    8: "⁸ And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of\
      \ eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,\n“Holy,\
      \ holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,\n    who was and is and is to come!”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him
      who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, '
    10: "¹⁰ the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne\
      \ and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before\
      \ the throne, saying, \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Worthy are you, our Lord and God,\n    to receive glory and honor and\
      \ power,\nfor you created all things,\n    and by your will they existed and\
      \ were created.”"
  5:
    1: '¹ Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll
      written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. '
    2: '² And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to
      open the scroll and break its seals?” '
    3: '³ And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the
      scroll or to look into it, '
    4: '⁴ and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll
      or to look into it. '
    5: "⁵ And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the\
      \ tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the\
      \ scroll and its seven seals.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders
      I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with
      seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. '
    7: '⁷ And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated
      on the throne. '
    8: '⁸ And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four
      elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full
      of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. '
    9: "⁹ And they sang a new song, saying,\n“Worthy are you to take the scroll\n\
      \    and to open its seals,\nfor you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed\
      \ people for God\n    from every tribe and language and people and nation,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,\n    and they\
      \ shall reign on the earth.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures
      and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands
      of thousands, '
    12: "¹² saying with a loud voice, \n“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,\nto receive\
      \ power and wealth and wisdom and might\nand honor and glory and blessing!”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth\
      \ and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, \n“To him who sits on the\
      \ throne and to the Lamb\nbe blessing and honor and glory and might forever\
      \ and ever!” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and
      worshiped.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one
      of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!” '
    2: "² And I looked, and behold, a white horse! And its rider had a bow, and a\
      \ crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer. \n"
    3: '³ When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say,
      “Come!” '
    4: "⁴ And out came another horse, bright red. Its rider was permitted to take\
      \ peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given\
      \ a great sword. \n"
    5: '⁵ When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!”
      And I looked, and behold, a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales
      in his hand. '
    6: "⁶ And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures,\
      \ saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a\
      \ denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!” \n"
    7: '⁷ When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature
      say, “Come!” '
    8: "⁸ And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death,\
      \ and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the\
      \ earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild\
      \ beasts of the earth. \n"
    9: '⁹ When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those
      who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne. '
    10: '¹⁰ They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how
      long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” '
    11: "¹¹ Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer,\
      \ until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete,\
      \ who were to be killed as they themselves had been. \n"
    12: '¹² When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great
      earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like
      blood, '
    13: '¹³ and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter
      fruit when shaken by a gale. '
    14: '¹⁴ The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain
      and island was removed from its place. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the
      rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid themselves in the caves
      and among the rocks of the mountains, '
    16: '¹⁶ calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face
      of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, '
    17: ¹⁷ for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”
  7:
    1: '¹ After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth,
      holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or
      sea or against any tree. '
    2: '² Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the
      seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who
      had been given power to harm earth and sea, '
    3: '³ saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed
      the servants of our God on their foreheads.” '
    4: "⁴ And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of\
      \ the sons of Israel: \n"
    5: "⁵ 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed,\n12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,\n\
      12,000 from the tribe of Gad,\n"
    6: "⁶ 12,000 from the tribe of Asher,\n12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,\n12,000\
      \ from the tribe of Manasseh,\n"
    7: "⁷ 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,\n12,000 from the tribe of Levi,\n12,000\
      \ from the tribe of Issachar,\n"
    8: "⁸ 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,\n12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,\n12,000\
      \ from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed. \n"
    9: '⁹ After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number,
      from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before
      the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in
      their hands, '
    10: '¹⁰ and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits
      on the throne, and to the Lamb!” '
    11: '¹¹ And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders
      and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne
      and worshiped God, '
    12: "¹² saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor\
      \ and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in
      white robes, and from where have they come?” '
    14: "¹⁴ I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones\
      \ coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made\
      \ them white in the blood of the Lamb. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Therefore they are before the throne of God,\n    and serve him day and\
      \ night in his temple;\n    and he who sits on the throne will shelter them\
      \ with his presence.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;\n    the sun shall\
      \ not strike them,\n    nor any scorching heat.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,\n    and\
      \ he will guide them to springs of living water,\nand God will wipe away every\
      \ tear from their eyes.”"
  8:
    1: '¹ When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about
      half an hour. '
    2: '² Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were
      given to them. '
    3: '³ And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and
      he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the
      golden altar before the throne, '
    4: '⁴ and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before
      God from the hand of the angel. '
    5: "⁵ Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and\
      \ threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes\
      \ of lightning, and an earthquake. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. \n"
    7: "⁷ The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed\
      \ with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth\
      \ was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass\
      \ was burned up. \n"
    8: '⁸ The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain,
      burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. '
    9: "⁹ A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships\
      \ were destroyed. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing
      like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. '
    11: "¹¹ The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood,\
      \ and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. \n"
    12: "¹² The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck,\
      \ and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their\
      \ light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining,\
      \ and likewise a third of the night. \n"
    13: ¹³ Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew
      directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts
      of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”
  9:
    1: '¹ And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven
      to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. '
    2: '² He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke
      like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with
      the smoke from the shaft. '
    3: '³ Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power
      like the power of scorpions of the earth. '
    4: '⁴ They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or
      any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. '
    5: '⁵ They were allowed to torment them for five months, but not to kill them,
      and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone. '
    6: "⁶ And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will\
      \ long to die, but death will flee from them. \n"
    7: '⁷ In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their
      heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, '
    8: "⁸ their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth; "
    9: '⁹ they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their
      wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. '
    10: '¹⁰ They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people
      for five months is in their tails. '
    11: "¹¹ They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name\
      \ in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon. \n"
    12: "¹² The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four
      horns of the golden altar before God, '
    14: '¹⁴ saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels
      who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” '
    15: '¹⁵ So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, the day, the month,
      and the year, were released to kill a third of mankind. '
    16: '¹⁶ The number of mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand;
      I heard their number. '
    17: "¹⁷ And this is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode them:\
      \ they wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur, and\
      \ the heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur\
      \ came out of their mouths. "
    18: '¹⁸ By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and
      smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths. '
    19: "¹⁹ For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for\
      \ their tails are like serpents with heads, and by means of them they wound.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent
      of the works of their hands nor give up worshiping demons and idols of gold
      and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk, '
    21: ²¹ nor did they repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual
      immorality or their thefts.
  10:
    1: '¹ Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud,
      with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like
      pillars of fire. '
    2: '² He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the
      sea, and his left foot on the land, '
    3: '³ and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he called out,
      the seven thunders sounded. '
    4: '⁴ And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard
      a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and
      do not write it down.” '
    5: '⁵ And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his
      right hand to heaven '
    6: '⁶ and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what
      is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there
      would be no more delay, '
    7: "⁷ but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel,\
      \ the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants\
      \ the prophets. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go,
      take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the
      sea and on the land.” '
    9: '⁹ So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he
      said to me, “Take and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your
      mouth it will be sweet as honey.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It
      was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made
      bitter. '
    11: ¹¹ And I was told, “You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations
      and languages and kings.”
  11:
    1: '¹ Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Rise and
      measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, '
    2: '² but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it
      is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two
      months. '
    3: "³ And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for\
      \ 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” \n"
    4: '⁴ These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the
      Lord of the earth. '
    5: '⁵ And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes
      their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed. '
    6: '⁶ They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days
      of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into
      blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire. '
    7: '⁷ And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the
      bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, '
    8: '⁸ and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically
      is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. '
    9: '⁹ For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages
      and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed
      in a tomb, '
    10: '¹⁰ and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry
      and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those
      who dwell on the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered
      them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw
      them. '
    12: '¹² Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!”
      And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. '
    13: "¹³ And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city\
      \ fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were\
      \ terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in
      heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord
      and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.” '
    16: '¹⁶ And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on
      their faces and worshiped God, '
    17: "¹⁷ saying,\n“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,\n    who is and who\
      \ was,\nfor you have taken your great power\n    and begun to reign.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The nations raged,\n    but your wrath came,\n    and the time for the\
      \ dead to be judged,\nand for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,\n\
      \    and those who fear your name,\n    both small and great,\nand for destroying\
      \ the destroyers of the earth.” \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was
      seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of
      thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
  12:
    1: '¹ And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with
      the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. '
    2: '² She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving
      birth. '
    3: '³ And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven
      heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems. '
    4: '⁴ His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the
      earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so
      that when she bore her child he might devour it. '
    5: '⁵ She gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with
      a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, '
    6: "⁶ and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by\
      \ God, in which she is to be nourished for 1,260 days. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon.
      And the dragon and his angels fought back, '
    8: '⁸ but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. '
    9: '⁹ And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called
      the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the
      earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. '
    10: '¹⁰ And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation and the
      power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come,
      for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and
      night before our God. '
    11: '¹¹ And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
      their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. '
    12: "¹² Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you,\
      \ O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because\
      \ he knows that his time is short!” \n"
    13: '¹³ And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he
      pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might
      fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished
      for a time, and times, and half a time. '
    15: '¹⁵ The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman,
      to sweep her away with a flood. '
    16: '¹⁶ But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its
      mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war
      on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and
      hold to the testimony of Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the sea.
  13:
    1: '¹ And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads,
      with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. '
    2: "² And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's,\
      \ and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power\
      \ and his throne and great authority. "
    3: '³ One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was
      healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast. '
    4: "⁴ And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast,\
      \ and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can\
      \ fight against it?” \n"
    5: '⁵ And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words,
      and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. '
    6: '⁶ It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name
      and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. '
    7: '⁷ Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority
      was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, '
    8: '⁸ and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not
      been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb
      who was slain. '
    9: "⁹ If anyone has an ear, let him hear: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ If anyone is to be taken captive,\n    to captivity he goes;\nif anyone\
      \ is to be slain with the sword,\n    with the sword must he be slain.\nHere\
      \ is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like
      a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. '
    12: '¹² It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and
      makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound
      was healed. '
    13: '¹³ It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth
      in front of people, '
    14: '¹⁴ and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast
      it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the
      beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived. '
    15: '¹⁵ And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the
      image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship
      the image of the beast to be slain. '
    16: '¹⁶ Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free
      and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, '
    17: '¹⁷ so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name
      of the beast or the number of its name. '
    18: '¹⁸ This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the
      number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.'
  14:
    1: "¹ Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000\
      \ who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. "
    2: '² And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the
      sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing
      on their harps, '
    3: '³ and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living
      creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000
      who had been redeemed from the earth. '
    4: '⁴ It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins.
      It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from
      mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb, '
    5: "⁵ and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel
      to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language
      and people. '
    7: "⁷ And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the\
      \ hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth,\
      \ the sea and the springs of water.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Another angel, a second, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the\
      \ great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual\
      \ immorality.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If
      anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead
      or on his hand, '
    10: "¹⁰ he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into\
      \ the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the\
      \ presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. "
    11: "¹¹ And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have\
      \ no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever\
      \ receives the mark of its name.” \n"
    12: "¹² Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments\
      \ of God and their faith in Jesus. \n"
    13: "¹³ And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead\
      \ who die in the Lord from now on.” “Blessed indeed,” says the Spirit, “that\
      \ they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one
      like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his
      hand. '
    15: '¹⁵ And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to
      him who sat on the cloud, “Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap
      has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the\
      \ earth was reaped. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a
      sharp sickle. '
    18: '¹⁸ And another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority
      over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp
      sickle, “Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth,
      for its grapes are ripe.” '
    19: '¹⁹ So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape
      harvest of the earth and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. '
    20: ²⁰ And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the
      winepress, as high as a horse's bridle, for 1,600 stadia.
  15:
    1: "¹ Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, seven angels with\
      \ seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire—and also
      those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name,
      standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands. '
    3: "³ And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the\
      \ Lamb, saying,\n“Great and amazing are your deeds,\n    O Lord God the Almighty!\n\
      Just and true are your ways,\n    O King of the nations!\n"
    4: "⁴ Who will not fear, O Lord,\n    and glorify your name?\nFor you alone are\
      \ holy.\n    All nations will come\n    and worship you,\nfor your righteous\
      \ acts have been revealed.” \n"
    5: '⁵ After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven
      was opened, '
    6: '⁶ and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed
      in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes around their chests. '
    7: '⁷ And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden
      bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever, '
    8: ⁸ and the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his
      power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven
      angels were finished.
  16:
    1: "¹ Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, “Go\
      \ and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.” \n"
    2: "² So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful\
      \ and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and\
      \ worshiped its image. \n"
    3: "³ The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the\
      \ blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea. \n"
    4: '⁴ The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water,
      and they became blood. '
    5: "⁵ And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say,\n“Just are you, O Holy\
      \ One, who is and who was,\n    for you brought these judgments.\n"
    6: "⁶ For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,\n    and you have given\
      \ them blood to drink.\nIt is what they deserve!” \n"
    7: "⁷ And I heard the altar saying,\n“Yes, Lord God the Almighty,\n    true and\
      \ just are your judgments!” \n"
    8: '⁸ The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch
      people with fire. '
    9: "⁹ They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who\
      \ had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its
      kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish '
    11: "¹¹ and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent\
      \ of their deeds. \n"
    12: '¹² The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and
      its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east. '
    13: '¹³ And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth
      of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits
      like frogs. '
    14: '¹⁴ For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings
      of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the
      Almighty. '
    15: '¹⁵ (“Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake,
      keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”) '
    16: "¹⁶ And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came
      out of the temple, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” '
    18: '¹⁸ And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and
      a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth,
      so great was that earthquake. '
    19: '¹⁹ The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations
      fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the
      wine of the fury of his wrath. '
    20: '²⁰ And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. '
    21: ²¹ And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on
      people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was
      so severe.
  17:
    1: '¹ Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me,
      “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on
      many waters, '
    2: '² with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with
      the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk.” '
    3: '³ And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman
      sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven
      heads and ten horns. '
    4: '⁴ The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels
      and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities
      of her sexual immorality. '
    5: "⁵ And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: “Babylon the great, mother\
      \ of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.” "
    6: "⁶ And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the\
      \ martyrs of Jesus.\nWhen I saw her, I marveled greatly. "
    7: '⁷ But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery
      of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. '
    8: '⁸ The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless
      pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been
      written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to
      see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. '
    9: '⁹ This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on
      which the woman is seated; '
    10: '¹⁰ they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other
      has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. '
    11: '¹¹ As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to
      the seven, and it goes to destruction. '
    12: '¹² And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received
      royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together
      with the beast. '
    13: '¹³ These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to
      the beast. '
    14: "¹⁴ They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he\
      \ is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen\
      \ and faithful.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And the angel said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute
      is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages. '
    16: '¹⁶ And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute.
      They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up
      with fire, '
    17: '¹⁷ for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being
      of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words
      of God are fulfilled. '
    18: ¹⁸ And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the
      kings of the earth.”
  18:
    1: '¹ After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority,
      and the earth was made bright with his glory. '
    2: "² And he called out with a mighty voice,\n“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!\n\
      \    She has become a dwelling place for demons,\na haunt for every unclean\
      \ spirit,\n    a haunt for every unclean bird,\n    a haunt for every unclean\
      \ and detestable beast.\n"
    3: "³ For all nations have drunk\n    the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality,\n\
      and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her,\n    and the\
      \ merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.”\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,\n“Come out of her, my people,\n\
      \    lest you take part in her sins,\nlest you share in her plagues;\n"
    5: "⁵ for her sins are heaped high as heaven,\n    and God has remembered her\
      \ iniquities.\n"
    6: "⁶ Pay her back as she herself has paid back others,\n    and repay her double\
      \ for her deeds;\n    mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed.\n"
    7: "⁷ As she glorified herself and lived in luxury,\n    so give her a like measure\
      \ of torment and mourning,\nsince in her heart she says,\n    ‘I sit as a queen,\n\
      I am no widow,\n    and mourning I shall never see.’\n"
    8: "⁸ For this reason her plagues will come in a single day,\n    death and mourning\
      \ and famine,\nand she will be burned up with fire;\n    for mighty is the Lord\
      \ God who has judged her.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in
      luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her
      burning. '
    10: "¹⁰ They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say,\n“Alas! Alas!\
      \ You great city,\n    you mighty city, Babylon!\nFor in a single hour your\
      \ judgment has come.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys
      their cargo anymore, '
    12: '¹² cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk,
      scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all
      kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble, '
    13: "¹³ cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour,\
      \ wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “The fruit for which your soul longed\n    has gone from you,\nand all\
      \ your delicacies and your splendors\n    are lost to you,\n    never to be\
      \ found again!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far\
      \ off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Alas, alas, for the great city\n    that was clothed in fine linen,\n\
      \        in purple and scarlet,\n    adorned with gold,\n        with jewels,\
      \ and with pearls!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For in a single hour all this wealth has been laid waste.”\nAnd all shipmasters\
      \ and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off "
    18: "¹⁸ and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning,\n“What city was like\
      \ the great city?” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out,\n\
      “Alas, alas, for the great city\n    where all who had ships at sea\n    grew\
      \ rich by her wealth!\nFor in a single hour she has been laid waste.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Rejoice over her, O heaven,\n    and you saints and apostles and prophets,\n\
      for God has given judgment for you against her!” \n"
    21: "²¹ Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it\
      \ into the sea, saying,\n“So will Babylon the great city be thrown down with\
      \ violence,\n    and will be found no more;\n"
    22: "²² and the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters,\n\
      \    will be heard in you no more,\nand a craftsman of any craft\n    will be\
      \ found in you no more,\nand the sound of the mill\n    will be heard in you\
      \ no more,\n"
    23: "²³ and the light of a lamp\n    will shine in you no more,\nand the voice\
      \ of bridegroom and bride\n    will be heard in you no more,\nfor your merchants\
      \ were the great ones of the earth,\n    and all nations were deceived by your\
      \ sorcery.\n"
    24: "²⁴ And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,\n    and of\
      \ all who have been slain on earth.”"
  19:
    1: "¹ After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude\
      \ in heaven, crying out,\n“Hallelujah!\nSalvation and glory and power belong\
      \ to our God,\n"
    2: "²     for his judgments are true and just;\nfor he has judged the great prostitute\n\
      \    who corrupted the earth with her immorality,\nand has avenged on her the\
      \ blood of his servants.” \n"
    3: "³ Once more they cried out,\n“Hallelujah!\nThe smoke from her goes up forever\
      \ and ever.” \n"
    4: '⁴ And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped
      God who was seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” '
    5: "⁵ And from the throne came a voice saying,\n“Praise our God,\n    all you\
      \ his servants,\nyou who fear him,\n    small and great.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the\
      \ roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying\
      \ out,\n“Hallelujah!\nFor the Lord our God\n    the Almighty reigns.\n"
    7: "⁷ Let us rejoice and exult\n    and give him the glory,\nfor the marriage\
      \ of the Lamb has come,\n    and his Bride has made herself ready;\n"
    8: "⁸ it was granted her to clothe herself\n    with fine linen, bright and pure”—\n\
      for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. \n"
    9: '⁹ And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited
      to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true
      words of God.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must\
      \ not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to\
      \ the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit\
      \ of prophecy. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on
      it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. '
    12: '¹² His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and
      he has a name written that no one knows but himself. '
    13: '¹³ He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called
      is The Word of God. '
    14: '¹⁴ And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were
      following him on white horses. '
    15: '¹⁵ From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations,
      and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the
      fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. '
    16: "¹⁶ On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and\
      \ Lord of lords. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called
      to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper
      of God, '
    18: '¹⁸ to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty
      men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free
      and slave, both small and great.” '
    19: '¹⁹ And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered
      to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. '
    20: '²⁰ And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence
      had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the
      beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the
      lake of fire that burns with sulfur. '
    21: ²¹ And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who
      was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.
  20:
    1: '¹ Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key
      to the bottomless pit and a great chain. '
    2: '² And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan,
      and bound him for a thousand years, '
    3: "³ and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that\
      \ he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were\
      \ ended. After that he must be released for a little while. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority
      to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded
      for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped
      the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their
      hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. '
    5: '⁵ The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were
      ended. This is the first resurrection. '
    6: "⁶ Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such\
      \ the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ,\
      \ and they will reign with him for a thousand years. \n"
    7: '⁷ And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison '
    8: '⁸ and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of
      the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the
      sand of the sea. '
    9: '⁹ And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the
      camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and
      consumed them, '
    10: "¹⁰ and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and\
      \ sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented\
      \ day and night forever and ever. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his
      presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. '
    12: '¹² And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books
      were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the
      dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had
      done. '
    13: '¹³ And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the
      dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to
      what they had done. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second
      death, the lake of fire. '
    15: ¹⁵ And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was
      thrown into the lake of fire.
  21:
    1: '¹ Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first
      earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. '
    2: '² And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
      prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. '
    3: '³ And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place
      of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and
      God himself will be with them as their God. '
    4: "⁴ He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more,\
      \ neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former\
      \ things have passed away.” \n"
    5: '⁵ And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things
      new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” '
    6: '⁶ And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning
      and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life
      without payment. '
    7: '⁷ The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and
      he will be my son. '
    8: "⁸ But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers,\
      \ the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will\
      \ be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven
      last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the
      wife of the Lamb.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed
      me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, '
    11: '¹¹ having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper,
      clear as crystal. '
    12: '¹² It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve
      angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel
      were inscribed— '
    13: '¹³ on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three
      gates, and on the west three gates. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the\
      \ twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the
      city and its gates and walls. '
    16: '¹⁶ The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured
      the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal. '
    17: "¹⁷ He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also\
      \ an angel's measurement. "
    18: '¹⁸ The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, like clear
      glass. '
    19: '¹⁹ The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of
      jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth
      emerald, '
    20: '²⁰ the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth
      beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth
      amethyst. '
    21: "²¹ And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single\
      \ pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. \n"
    22: '²² And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty
      and the Lamb. '
    23: '²³ And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory
      of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. '
    24: '²⁴ By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring
      their glory into it, '
    25: '²⁵ and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. '
    26: '²⁶ They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. '
    27: ²⁷ But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable
      or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.
  22:
    1: '¹ Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal,
      flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb '
    2: '² through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the
      river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each
      month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. '
    3: '³ No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of
      the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. '
    4: '⁴ They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. '
    5: "⁵ And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the\
      \ Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord,\

      \ the prophecy of this book.” \n"
    8: '⁸ I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and
      saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to
      me, '
    9: "⁹ but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you\
      \ and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this\
      \ book. Worship God.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book,

    11: "¹¹ Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the\
      \ righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.” \n"
    12: '¹² “Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each

      \ the end.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right
      to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. '
    15: "¹⁵ Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers\
      \ and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for\
      \ the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning\
      \ star.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.”\
      \ And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water\
      \ of life without price. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone
      adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, '
    19: "¹⁹ and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy,\
      \ God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which\
      \ are described in this book. \n"
    20: "²⁰ He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen.\
      \ Come, Lord Jesus! \n"
    21: ²¹ The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
