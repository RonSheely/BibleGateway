Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in
      Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, '
    2: '² to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon,
      king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. '
    3: "³ It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,\
      \ and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king\
      \ of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n"
    5: "⁵ “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nand before you were born I\
      \ consecrated you;\nI appointed you a prophet to the nations.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am
      only a youth.” '
    7: "⁷ But the Lord said to me,\n“Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;\nfor to all\
      \ to whom I send you, you shall go,\nand whatever I command you, you shall speak.\n"
    8: "⁸ Do not be afraid of them,\nfor I am with you to deliver you,\ndeclares the\
      \ Lord.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said to\
      \ me,\n“Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms,\nto pluck\
      \ up and to break down,\nto destroy and to overthrow,\nto build and to plant.”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”
      And I said, “I see an almond branch.” '
    12: "¹² Then the Lord said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over\
      \ my word to perform it.” \n"
    13: '¹³ The word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?”
      And I said, “I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to me, “Out of the north disaster shall be let loose
      upon all the inhabitants of the land. '
    15: '¹⁵ For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north,
      declares the Lord, and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at
      the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and
      against all the cities of Judah. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil in forsaking
      me. They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their
      own hands. '
    17: '¹⁷ But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that
      I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. '
    18: '¹⁸ And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and
      bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials,
      its priests, and the people of the land. '
    19: ¹⁹ They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for
      I am with you, declares the Lord, to deliver you.”
  2:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the Lord,\n“I remember\
      \ the devotion of your youth,\n    your love as a bride,\nhow you followed me\
      \ in the wilderness,\n    in a land not sown.\n"
    3: "³ Israel was holy to the Lord,\n    the firstfruits of his harvest.\nAll who\
      \ ate of it incurred guilt;\n    disaster came upon them,\ndeclares the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house
      of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord:\n“What wrong did your fathers find in me\n    that they\
      \ went far from me,\nand went after worthlessness, and became worthless?\n"
    6: "⁶ They did not say, ‘Where is the Lord\n    who brought us up from the land\
      \ of Egypt,\nwho led us in the wilderness,\n    in a land of deserts and pits,\n\
      in a land of drought and deep darkness,\n    in a land that none passes through,\n\
      \    where no man dwells?’\n"
    7: "⁷ And I brought you into a plentiful land\n    to enjoy its fruits and its\
      \ good things.\nBut when you came in, you defiled my land\n    and made my heritage\
      \ an abomination.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’\n    Those who handle the\
      \ law did not know me;\nthe shepherds transgressed against me;\n    the prophets\
      \ prophesied by Baal\n    and went after things that do not profit. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I still contend with you,\ndeclares the Lord,\n    and with your\
      \ children's children I will contend.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see,\n    or send to Kedar and examine\
      \ with care;\n    see if there has been such a thing.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has a nation changed its gods,\n    even though they are no gods?\nBut\
      \ my people have changed their glory\n    for that which does not profit.\n"
    12: "¹² Be appalled, O heavens, at this;\n    be shocked, be utterly desolate,\n\
      declares the Lord,\n"
    13: "¹³ for my people have committed two evils:\nthey have forsaken me,\n    the\
      \ fountain of living waters,\nand hewed out cisterns for themselves,\n    broken\
      \ cisterns that can hold no water. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?\n    Why then has he become\
      \ a prey?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The lions have roared against him;\n    they have roared loudly.\nThey\
      \ have made his land a waste;\n    his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\n    have shaved the crown\
      \ of your head.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Have you not brought this upon yourself\n    by forsaking the Lord your\
      \ God,\n    when he led you in the way?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ And now what do you gain by going to Egypt\n    to drink the waters of\
      \ the Nile?\nOr what do you gain by going to Assyria\n    to drink the waters\
      \ of the Euphrates?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your evil will chastise you,\n    and your apostasy will reprove you.\n\
      Know and see that it is evil and bitter\n    for you to forsake the Lord your\
      \ God;\n    the fear of me is not in you,\ndeclares the Lord God of hosts. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “For long ago I broke your yoke\n    and burst your bonds;\n    but you\
      \ said, ‘I will not serve.’\nYes, on every high hill\n    and under every green\
      \ tree\n    you bowed down like a whore.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet I planted you a choice vine,\n    wholly of pure seed.\nHow then have\
      \ you turned degenerate\n    and become a wild vine?\n"
    22: "²² Though you wash yourself with lye\n    and use much soap,\n    the stain\
      \ of your guilt is still before me,\ndeclares the Lord God.\n"
    23: "²³ How can you say, ‘I am not unclean,\n    I have not gone after the Baals’?\n\
      Look at your way in the valley;\n    know what you have done—\na restless young\
      \ camel running here and there,\n"
    24: "²⁴     a wild donkey used to the wilderness,\nin her heat sniffing the wind!\n\
      \    Who can restrain her lust?\nNone who seek her need weary themselves;\n\
      \    in her month they will find her.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Keep your feet from going unshod\n    and your throat from thirst.\nBut\
      \ you said, ‘It is hopeless,\n    for I have loved foreigners,\n    and after\
      \ them I will go.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “As a thief is shamed when caught,\n    so the house of Israel shall be\
      \ shamed:\nthey, their kings, their officials,\n    their priests, and their\
      \ prophets,\n"
    27: "²⁷ who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’\n    and to a stone, ‘You gave\
      \ me birth.’\nFor they have turned their back to me,\n    and not their face.\n\
      But in the time of their trouble they say,\n    ‘Arise and save us!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ But where are your gods\n    that you made for yourself?\nLet them arise,\
      \ if they can save you,\n    in your time of trouble;\nfor as many as your cities\n\
      \    are your gods, O Judah. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Why do you contend with me?\n    You have all transgressed against me,\n\
      declares the Lord.\n"
    30: "³⁰ In vain have I struck your children;\n    they took no correction;\nyour\
      \ own sword devoured your prophets\n    like a ravening lion.\n"
    31: "³¹ And you, O generation, behold the word of the Lord.\nHave I been a wilderness\
      \ to Israel,\n    or a land of thick darkness?\nWhy then do my people say, ‘We\
      \ are free,\n    we will come no more to you’?\n"
    32: "³² Can a virgin forget her ornaments,\n    or a bride her attire?\nYet my\
      \ people have forgotten me\n    days without number. \n"
    33: "³³ “How well you direct your course\n    to seek love!\nSo that even to wicked\
      \ women\n    you have taught your ways.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Also on your skirts is found\n    the lifeblood of the guiltless poor;\n\
      you did not find them breaking in.\n    Yet in spite of all these things\n"
    35: "³⁵ you say, ‘I am innocent;\n    surely his anger has turned from me.’\n\
      Behold, I will bring you to judgment\n    for saying, ‘I have not sinned.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ How much you go about,\n    changing your way!\nYou shall be put to shame\
      \ by Egypt\n    as you were put to shame by Assyria.\n"
    37: "³⁷ From it too you will come away\n    with your hands on your head,\nfor\
      \ the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust,\n    and you will not prosper\
      \ by them."
  3:
    1: "¹ “If a man divorces his wife\n    and she goes from him\nand becomes another\
      \ man's wife,\n    will he return to her?\nWould not that land be greatly polluted?\n\
      You have played the whore with many lovers;\n    and would you return to me?\n\
      declares the Lord.\n"
    2: "² Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see!\n    Where have you not\
      \ been ravished?\nBy the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers\n    like an\
      \ Arab in the wilderness.\nYou have polluted the land\n    with your vile whoredom.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the showers have been withheld,\n    and the spring rain has not\
      \ come;\nyet you have the forehead of a whore;\n    you refuse to be ashamed.\n"
    4: "⁴ Have you not just now called to me,\n    ‘My father, you are the friend\
      \ of my youth—\n"
    5: "⁵ will he be angry forever,\n    will he be indignant to the end?’\nBehold,\
      \ you have spoken,\n    but you have done all the evil that you could.” \n"
    6: '⁶ The Lord said to me in the days of King Josiah: “Have you seen what she
      did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under
      every green tree, and there played the whore? '
    7: '⁷ And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but
      she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. '
    8: '⁸ She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had
      sent her away with a decree of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did
      not fear, but she too went and played the whore. '
    9: '⁹ Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing
      adultery with stone and tree. '
    10: "¹⁰ Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with\
      \ her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the Lord.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the Lord said to me, “Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous
      than treacherous Judah. '
    12: "¹² Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,\n“‘Return, faithless\
      \ Israel,\ndeclares the Lord.\nI will not look on you in anger,\n    for I am\
      \ merciful,\ndeclares the Lord;\nI will not be angry forever.\n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge your guilt,\n    that you rebelled against the Lord your\
      \ God\nand scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree,\n\
      \    and that you have not obeyed my voice,\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Return, O faithless children,\ndeclares the Lord;\n    for I am your master;\n\
      I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,\n    and I will bring\
      \ you to Zion. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you
      with knowledge and understanding. '
    16: '¹⁶ And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days,
      declares the Lord, they shall no more say, “The ark of the covenant of the Lord.”
      It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again. '
    17: '¹⁷ At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord, and all
      nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the Lord in Jerusalem, and they
      shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart. '
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together\
      \ they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers\
      \ for a heritage. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “‘I said,\n    How I would set you among my sons,\nand give you a pleasant\
      \ land,\n    a heritage most beautiful of all nations.\nAnd I thought you would\
      \ call me, My Father,\n    and would not turn from following me.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband,\n    so have you been\
      \ treacherous to me, O house of Israel,\ndeclares the Lord.’” \n"
    21: "²¹ A voice on the bare heights is heard,\n    the weeping and pleading of\
      \ Israel's sons\nbecause they have perverted their way;\n    they have forgotten\
      \ the Lord their God.\n"
    22: "²² “Return, O faithless sons;\n    I will heal your faithlessness.”\n“Behold,\
      \ we come to you,\n    for you are the Lord our God.\n"
    23: "²³ Truly the hills are a delusion,\n    the orgies on the mountains.\nTruly\
      \ in the Lord our God\n    is the salvation of Israel. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our
      fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. '
    25: ²⁵ Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have
      sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to
      this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”
  4:
    1: "¹ “If you return, O Israel,\ndeclares the Lord,\n    to me you should return.\n\
      If you remove your detestable things from my presence,\n    and do not waver,\n"
    2: "² and if you swear, ‘As the Lord lives,’\n    in truth, in justice, and in\
      \ righteousness,\nthen nations shall bless themselves in him,\n    and in him\
      \ shall they glory.” \n"
    3: "³ For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:\n“Break up your\
      \ fallow ground,\n    and sow not among thorns.\n"
    4: "⁴ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord;\n    remove the foreskin of your hearts,\n\
      \    O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;\nlest my wrath go forth like\
      \ fire,\n    and burn with none to quench it,\n    because of the evil of your\
      \ deeds.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,\n“Blow the trumpet\
      \ through the land;\n    cry aloud and say,\n‘Assemble, and let us go\n    into\
      \ the fortified cities!’\n"
    6: "⁶ Raise a standard toward Zion,\n    flee for safety, stay not,\nfor I bring\
      \ disaster from the north,\n    and great destruction.\n"
    7: "⁷ A lion has gone up from his thicket,\n    a destroyer of nations has set\
      \ out;\n    he has gone out from his place\nto make your land a waste;\n   \
      \ your cities will be ruins\n    without inhabitant.\n"
    8: "⁸ For this put on sackcloth,\n    lament and wail,\nfor the fierce anger of\
      \ the Lord\n    has not turned back from us.” \n"
    9: '⁹ “In that day, declares the Lord, courage shall fail both king and officials.
      The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “Ah, Lord God, surely you have utterly deceived this people\
      \ and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It shall be well with you,’ whereas the sword has\
      \ reached their very life.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind
      from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to
      winnow or cleanse, '
    12: "¹² a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment\
      \ upon them.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, he comes up like clouds;\n    his chariots like the whirlwind;\n\
      his horses are swifter than eagles—\n    woe to us, for we are ruined!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil,\n    that you may be saved.\n\
      How long shall your wicked thoughts\n    lodge within you?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For a voice declares from Dan\n    and proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Warn the nations that he is coming;\n    announce to Jerusalem,\n“Besiegers\
      \ come from a distant land;\n    they shout against the cities of Judah.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Like keepers of a field are they against her all around,\n    because\
      \ she has rebelled against me,\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your ways and your deeds\n    have brought this upon you.\nThis is your\
      \ doom, and it is bitter;\n    it has reached your very heart.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!\n    Oh the walls of my heart!\n\
      My heart is beating wildly;\n    I cannot keep silent,\nfor I hear the sound\
      \ of the trumpet,\n    the alarm of war.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Crash follows hard on crash;\n    the whole land is laid waste.\nSuddenly\
      \ my tents are laid waste,\n    my curtains in a moment.\n"
    21: "²¹ How long must I see the standard\n    and hear the sound of the trumpet?\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² “For my people are foolish;\n    they know me not;\nthey are stupid children;\n\
      \    they have no understanding.\nThey are ‘wise’—in doing evil!\n    But how\
      \ to do good they know not.” \n"
    23: "²³ I looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void;\n   \
      \ and to the heavens, and they had no light.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,\n    and all\
      \ the hills moved to and fro.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I looked, and behold, there was no man,\n    and all the birds of the\
      \ air had fled.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a desert,\n    and all its\
      \ cities were laid in ruins\n    before the Lord, before his fierce anger. \n"
    27: "²⁷ For thus says the Lord, “The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will\
      \ not make a full end. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “For this the earth shall mourn,\n    and the heavens above be dark;\n\
      for I have spoken; I have purposed;\n    I have not relented, nor will I turn\
      \ back.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ At the noise of horseman and archer\n    every city takes to flight;\n\
      they enter thickets; they climb among rocks;\n    all the cities are forsaken,\n\
      \    and no man dwells in them.\n"
    30: "³⁰ And you, O desolate one,\nwhat do you mean that you dress in scarlet,\n\
      \    that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold,\n    that you enlarge your\
      \ eyes with paint?\nIn vain you beautify yourself.\n    Your lovers despise\
      \ you;\n    they seek your life.\n"
    31: "³¹ For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor,\n    anguish as of one giving\
      \ birth to her first child,\nthe cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath,\n\
      \    stretching out her hands,\n“Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers.”"
  5:
    1: "¹ Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,\n    look and take note!\n\
      Search her squares to see\n    if you can find a man,\none who does justice\n\
      \    and seeks truth,\nthat I may pardon her.\n"
    2: "² Though they say, “As the Lord lives,”\n    yet they swear falsely.\n"
    3: "³ O Lord, do not your eyes look for truth?\nYou have struck them down,\n \
      \   but they felt no anguish;\nyou have consumed them,\n    but they refused\
      \ to take correction.\nThey have made their faces harder than rock;\n    they\
      \ have refused to repent. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then I said, “These are only the poor;\n    they have no sense;\nfor they\
      \ do not know the way of the Lord,\n    the justice of their God.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will go to the great\n    and will speak to them,\nfor they know the way\
      \ of the Lord,\n    the justice of their God.”\nBut they all alike had broken\
      \ the yoke;\n    they had burst the bonds. \n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore a lion from the forest shall strike them down;\n    a wolf from\
      \ the desert shall devastate them.\nA leopard is watching their cities;\n  \
      \  everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces,\nbecause their transgressions\
      \ are many,\n    their apostasies are great. \n"
    7: "⁷ “How can I pardon you?\n    Your children have forsaken me\n    and have\
      \ sworn by those who are no gods.\nWhen I fed them to the full,\n    they committed\
      \ adultery\n    and trooped to the houses of whores.\n"
    8: "⁸ They were well-fed, lusty stallions,\n    each neighing for his neighbor's\
      \ wife.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I not punish them for these things?\ndeclares the Lord;\n    and shall\
      \ I not avenge myself\n    on a nation such as this? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Go up through her vine rows and destroy,\n    but make not a full end;\n\

    3: '³ You shall say to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed be
      the man who does not hear the words of this covenant '
    4: '⁴ that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
      from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command
      you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God, '
    5: "⁵ that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a\
      \ land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be\
      \ it, Lord.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And the Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them. '
    7: '⁷ For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land
      of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice. '
    8: "⁸ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness\
      \ of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant,\
      \ which I commanded them to do, but they did not.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Again the Lord said to me, “A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and
      the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused
      to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of
      Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their
      fathers. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore, thus says the Lord, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them
      that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them. '
    12: '¹² Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and
      cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the

    13: "¹³ For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many\

    14: '¹⁴ “Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on

  12:
    1: "¹ Righteous are you, O Lord,\n    when I complain to you;\n    yet I would\

    3: "³ But you, O Lord, know me;\n    you see me, and test my heart toward you.\n\

    4: "⁴ How long will the land mourn\n    and the grass of every field wither?\n\
      For the evil of those who dwell in it\n    the beasts and the birds are swept\

    5: "⁵ “If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you,\n    how\

      \    what will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?\n"
    6: "⁶ For even your brothers and the house of your father,\n    even they have\

      \ believe them,\n    though they speak friendly words to you.” \n"
    7: "⁷ “I have forsaken my house;\n    I have abandoned my heritage;\nI have given\
      \ the beloved of my soul\n    into the hands of her enemies.\n"
    8: "⁸ My heritage has become to me\n    like a lion in the forest;\nshe has lifted\
      \ up her voice against me;\n    therefore I hate her.\n"
    9: "⁹ Is my heritage to me like a hyena's lair?\n    Are the birds of prey against\
      \ her all around?\nGo, assemble all the wild beasts;\n    bring them to devour.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard;\n    they have trampled down\
      \ my portion;\nthey have made my pleasant portion\n    a desolate wilderness.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They have made it a desolation;\n    desolate, it mourns to me.\nThe whole\

    12: "¹² Upon all the bare heights in the desert\n    destroyers have come,\nfor\

    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the Lord concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage
      that I have given my people Israel to inherit: “Behold, I will pluck them up

    15: '¹⁵ And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them,

    16: '¹⁶ And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my

    5: '⁵ So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. '
    6: '⁶ And after many days the Lord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and

    7: "⁷ Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the\

      \ good for nothing. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '

    10: '¹⁰ This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their
      own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall
      be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing. '
    11: "¹¹ For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole\
      \ house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the Lord,\

    13: "¹³ Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will fill with\

    17: "¹⁷ But if you will not listen,\n    my soul will weep in secret for your\

    18: "¹⁸ Say to the king and the queen mother:\n    “Take a lowly seat,\nfor your\

      sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of
      Maaseiah, saying, '
    2: "² “Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making\
      \ war against us. Perhaps the Lord will deal with us according to all his wonderful\
      \ deeds and will make him withdraw from us.” \n"
    3: '³ Then Jeremiah said to them: “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, '
    4: '⁴ ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons
      of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king
      of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls.
      And I will bring them together into the midst of this city. '
    5: '⁵ I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in
      anger and in fury and in great wrath. '
    6: '⁶ And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast.
      They shall die of a great pestilence. '
    7: "⁷ Afterward, declares the Lord, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his\
      \ servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and\
      \ famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of\
      \ their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall strike\
      \ them down with the edge of the sword. He shall not pity them or spare them\
      \ or have compassion.’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “And to this people you shall say: ‘Thus says the Lord: Behold, I set before
      you the way of life and the way of death. '
    9: '⁹ He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,
      but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall
      live and shall have his life as a prize of war. '
    10: "¹⁰ For I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, declares\
      \ the Lord: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall\
      \ burn it with fire.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “And to the house of the king of Judah say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, '
    12: "¹² O house of David! Thus says the Lord:\n“‘Execute justice in the morning,\n\
      \    and deliver from the hand of the oppressor\n    him who has been robbed,\n\
      lest my wrath go forth like fire,\n    and burn with none to quench it,\n  \
      \  because of your evil deeds.’” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,\n    O rock of\
      \ the plain,\ndeclares the Lord;\nyou who say, ‘Who shall come down against\
      \ us,\n    or who shall enter our habitations?’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will punish you according to the fruit of your deeds,\ndeclares the\
      \ Lord;\n    I will kindle a fire in her forest,\n    and it shall devour all\
      \ that is around her.”"
  22:
    1: '¹ Thus says the Lord: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak
      there this word, '
    2: '² and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne
      of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates. '
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand
      of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the
      resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this
      place. '
    4: '⁴ For if you will indeed obey this word, then there shall enter the gates
      of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on
      horses, they and their servants and their people. '
    5: '⁵ But if you will not obey these words, I swear by myself, declares the Lord,
      that this house shall become a desolation. '
    6: "⁶ For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah:\n“‘You\
      \ are like Gilead to me,\n    like the summit of Lebanon,\nyet surely I will\
      \ make you a desert,\n    an uninhabited city.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will prepare destroyers against you,\n    each with his weapons,\nand\
      \ they shall cut down your choicest cedars\n    and cast them into the fire.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his
      neighbor, “Why has the Lord dealt thus with this great city?” '
    9: "⁹ And they will answer, “Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord\
      \ their God and worshiped other gods and served them.”’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Weep not for him who is dead,\n    nor grieve for him,\nbut weep bitterly\
      \ for him who goes away,\n    for he shall return no more\n    to see his native\
      \ land. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went away from this place:
      “He shall return here no more, '
    12: "¹² but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die,\
      \ and he shall never see this land again.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,\n    and his upper\
      \ rooms by injustice,\nwho makes his neighbor serve him for nothing\n    and\
      \ does not give him his wages,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ who says, ‘I will build myself a great house\n    with spacious upper\
      \ rooms,’\nwho cuts out windows for it,\n    paneling it with cedar\n    and\
      \ painting it with vermilion.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Do you think you are a king\n    because you compete in cedar?\nDid not\
      \ your father eat and drink\n    and do justice and righteousness?\n    Then\
      \ it was well with him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He judged the cause of the poor and needy;\n    then it was well.\nIs\
      \ not this to know me?\n    declares the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ But you have eyes and heart\n    only for your dishonest gain,\nfor shedding\
      \ innocent blood,\n    and for practicing oppression and violence.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king\
      \ of Judah:\n“They shall not lament for him, saying,\n    ‘Ah, my brother!’\
      \ or ‘Ah, sister!’\nThey shall not lament for him, saying,\n    ‘Ah, lord!’\
      \ or ‘Ah, his majesty!’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried,\n    dragged and dumped\
      \ beyond the gates of Jerusalem.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,\n    and lift up your voice in Bashan;\n\
      cry out from Abarim,\n    for all your lovers are destroyed.\n"
    21: "²¹ I spoke to you in your prosperity,\n    but you said, ‘I will not listen.’\n\
      This has been your way from your youth,\n    that you have not obeyed my voice.\n"
    22: "²² The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,\n    and your lovers shall\
      \ go into captivity;\nthen you will be ashamed and confounded\n    because of\
      \ all your evil.\n"
    23: "²³ O inhabitant of Lebanon,\n    nested among the cedars,\nhow you will be\
      \ pitied when pangs come upon you,\n    pain as of a woman in labor!” \n"
    24: '²⁴ “As I live, declares the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king
      of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off '
    25: '²⁵ and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand
      of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of
      Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. '
    26: '²⁶ I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where
      you were not born, and there you shall die. '
    27: "²⁷ But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not\
      \ return.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot,\n    a vessel no one cares\
      \ for?\nWhy are he and his children hurled and cast\n    into a land that they\
      \ do not know?\n"
    29: "²⁹ O land, land, land,\n    hear the word of the Lord!\n"
    30: "³⁰ Thus says the Lord:\n“Write this man down as childless,\n    a man who\
      \ shall not succeed in his days,\nfor none of his offspring shall succeed\n\
      \    in sitting on the throne of David\n    and ruling again in Judah.”"
  23:
    1: '¹ “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!”
      declares the Lord. '
    2: '² Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds
      who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away,
      and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil
      deeds, declares the Lord. '
    3: '³ Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where
      I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall
      be fruitful and multiply. '
    4: "⁴ I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear\
      \ no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up for
      David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall
      execute justice and righteousness in the land. '
    6: "⁶ In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this\
      \ is the name by which he will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when they shall
      no longer say, ‘As the Lord lives who brought up the people of Israel out of
      the land of Egypt,’ '
    8: "⁸ but ‘As the Lord lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house\
      \ of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had\
      \ driven them.’ Then they shall dwell in their own land.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Concerning the prophets:\nMy heart is broken within me;\n    all my bones\
      \ shake;\nI am like a drunken man,\n    like a man overcome by wine,\nbecause\
      \ of the Lord\n    and because of his holy words.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the land is full of adulterers;\n    because of the curse the land\
      \ mourns,\n    and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.\nTheir course\
      \ is evil,\n    and their might is not right.\n"
    11: "¹¹ “Both prophet and priest are ungodly;\n    even in my house I have found\
      \ their evil,\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore their way shall be to them\n    like slippery paths in the darkness,\n\
      \    into which they shall be driven and fall,\nfor I will bring disaster upon\
      \ them\n    in the year of their punishment,\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ In the prophets of Samaria\n    I saw an unsavory thing:\nthey prophesied\
      \ by Baal\n    and led my people Israel astray.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But in the prophets of Jerusalem\n    I have seen a horrible thing:\n\
      they commit adultery and walk in lies;\n    they strengthen the hands of evildoers,\n\
      \    so that no one turns from his evil;\nall of them have become like Sodom\
      \ to me,\n    and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets:\n“Behold,\
      \ I will feed them with bitter food\n    and give them poisoned water to drink,\n\
      for from the prophets of Jerusalem\n    ungodliness has gone out into all the\
      \ land.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets
      who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their
      own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord. '
    17: "¹⁷ They say continually to those who despise the word of the Lord, ‘It shall\
      \ be well with you’; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they\
      \ say, ‘No disaster shall come upon you.’” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For who among them has stood in the council of the Lord\n    to see and\
      \ to hear his word,\n    or who has paid attention to his word and listened?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, the storm of the Lord!\n    Wrath has gone forth,\na whirling\
      \ tempest;\n    it will burst upon the head of the wicked.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The anger of the Lord will not turn back\n    until he has executed and\
      \ accomplished\n    the intents of his heart.\nIn the latter days you will understand\
      \ it clearly. \n"
    21: "²¹ “I did not send the prophets,\n    yet they ran;\nI did not speak to them,\n\
      \    yet they prophesied.\n"
    22: "²² But if they had stood in my council,\n    then they would have proclaimed\
      \ my words to my people,\nand they would have turned them from their evil way,\n\
      \    and from the evil of their deeds. \n"
    23: '²³ “Am I a God at hand, declares the Lord, and not a God far away? '
    24: '²⁴ Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares
      the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name,
      saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ '
    26: '²⁶ How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy
      lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart, '
    27: '²⁷ who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell
      one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? '
    28: '²⁸ Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my
      word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares
      the Lord. '
    29: '²⁹ Is not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks
      the rock in pieces? '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the Lord, who steal
      my words from one another. '
    31: '³¹ Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the Lord, who use their tongues
      and declare, ‘declares the Lord.’ '
    32: "³² Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the Lord,\
      \ and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness,\
      \ when I did not send them or charge them. So they do not profit this people\
      \ at all, declares the Lord. \n"
    33: '³³ “When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is
      the burden of the Lord?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will
      cast you off, declares the Lord.’ '
    34: '³⁴ And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden
      of the Lord,’ I will punish that man and his household. '
    35: '³⁵ Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother,
      ‘What has the Lord answered?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    36: "³⁶ But ‘the burden of the Lord’ you shall mention no more, for the burden\
      \ is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the\
      \ Lord of hosts, our God. "
    37: '³⁷ Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the Lord answered you?’ or
      ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    38: '³⁸ But if you say, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ thus says the Lord, ‘Because
      you have said these words, “The burden of the Lord,” when I sent to you, saying,
      “You shall not say, ‘The burden of the Lord,’” '
    39: '³⁹ therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my
      presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which
      shall not be forgotten.’”
  24:
    1: '¹ After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem
      Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with the officials of
      Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon,
      the Lord showed me this vision: behold, two baskets of figs placed before the
      temple of the Lord. '
    2: '² One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket
      had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. '
    3: "³ And the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the\
      \ good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be\
      \ eaten.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    5: '⁵ “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will
      regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place
      to the land of the Chaldeans. '
    6: '⁶ I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this
      land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not
      pluck them up. '
    7: "⁷ I will give them a heart to know that I am the Lord, and they shall be my\
      \ people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole\
      \ heart. \n"
    8: '⁸ “But thus says the Lord: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be
      eaten, so will I treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant
      of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a reproach,
      a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them. '
    10: ¹⁰ And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall
      be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.”
  25:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the
      fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first
      year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), '
    2: '² which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem: '
    3: '³ “For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon,
      king of Judah, to this day, the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have
      spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened. '
    4: '⁴ You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the Lord
      persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets, '
    5: '⁵ saying, ‘Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and
      dwell upon the land that the Lord has given to you and your fathers from of
      old and forever. '
    6: '⁶ Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger
      with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’ '
    7: "⁷ Yet you have not listened to me, declares the Lord, that you might provoke\
      \ me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words, '
    9: '⁹ behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the Lord,
      and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them
      against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations.
      I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an
      everlasting desolation. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of
      gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding
      of the millstones and the light of the lamp. '
    11: '¹¹ This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall
      serve the king of Babylon seventy years. '
    12: '¹² Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon
      and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the
      Lord, making the land an everlasting waste. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against

    14: "¹⁴ For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I\

    34: "³⁴ “Wail, you shepherds, and cry out,\n    and roll in ashes, you lords of\
      \ the flock,\nfor the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come,\n   \
      \ and you shall fall like a choice vessel.\n"
    35: "³⁵ No refuge will remain for the shepherds,\n    nor escape for the lords\
      \ of the flock.\n"
    36: "³⁶ A voice—the cry of the shepherds,\n    and the wail of the lords of the\
      \ flock!\nFor the Lord is laying waste their pasture,\n"
    37: "³⁷     and the peaceful folds are devastated\n    because of the fierce anger\
      \ of the Lord.\n"
    38: "³⁸ Like a lion he has left his lair,\n    for their land has become a waste\n\
      because of the sword of the oppressor,\n    and because of his fierce anger.”"
  26:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      this word came from the Lord: '
    2: "² “Thus says the Lord: Stand in the court of the Lord's house, and speak to\
      \ all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the Lord all\
      \ the words that I command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word. "
    3: '³ It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I
      may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them because of their evil
      deeds. '
    4: '⁴ You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord: If you will not listen to me,
      to walk in my law that I have set before you, '
    5: '⁵ and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you
      urgently, though you have not listened, '
    6: "⁶ then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse\
      \ for all the nations of the earth.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking
      these words in the house of the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded
      him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the
      people laid hold of him, saying, “You shall die! '
    9: "⁹ Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘This house shall\
      \ be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And\
      \ all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the\
      \ king's house to the house of the Lord and took their seat in the entry of\
      \ the New Gate of the house of the Lord. "
    11: "¹¹ Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the\
      \ people, “This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied\
      \ against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, “The
      Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you
      have heard. '
    13: '¹³ Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the
      Lord your God, and the Lord will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced
      against you. '
    14: '¹⁴ But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and
      right to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent\
      \ blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth\
      \ the Lord sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets,
      “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in
      the name of the Lord our God.” '
    17: '¹⁷ And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled
      people, saying, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,\
      \ and said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts,\n“‘Zion\
      \ shall be plowed as a field;\n    Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,\n\
      \    and the mountain of the house a wooded height.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not\
      \ fear the Lord and entreat the favor of the Lord, and did not the Lord relent\
      \ of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring\
      \ great disaster upon ourselves.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ There was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah the
      son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against
      this land in words like those of Jeremiah. '
    21: '²¹ And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials,
      heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of
      it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt. '
    22: '²² Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor
      and others with him, '
    23: "²³ and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who\
      \ struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place\
      \ of the common people. \n"
    24: ²⁴ But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he
      was not given over to the people to be put to death.
  27:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord. '
    2: '² Thus the Lord said to me: “Make yourself straps and yoke-bars, and put them
      on your neck. '
    3: '³ Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of
      Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who
      have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. '
    4: '⁴ Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the
      God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters: '
    5: '⁵ “It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth,
      with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it
      seems right to me. '
    6: '⁶ Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king
      of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to
      serve him. '
    7: "⁷ All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the\
      \ time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him\
      \ their slave. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘“But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king
      of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish
      that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the Lord,
      until I have consumed it by his hand. '
    9: '⁹ So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers,
      or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that
      you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will
      perish. '
    11: "¹¹ But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of\
      \ Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell\
      \ there, declares the Lord.”’” \n"
    12: '¹² To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: “Bring your necks under
      the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live. '
    13: '¹³ Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,
      as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of
      Babylon? '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, ‘You
      shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for it is a lie that they are prophesying
      to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ I have not sent them, declares the Lord, but they are prophesying falsely\
      \ in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish,\
      \ you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says\
      \ the Lord: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying\
      \ to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house will now shortly\
      \ be brought back from Babylon,’ for it is a lie that they are prophesying to\
      \ you. "
    17: '¹⁷ Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should
      this city become a desolation? '
    18: '¹⁸ If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, then let
      them intercede with the Lord of hosts, that the vessels that are left in the
      house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not
      go to Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands,
      and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, '
    20: '²⁰ which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into
      exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah,
      and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— '
    21: '²¹ thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels
      that are left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and
      in Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I
      visit them, declares the Lord. Then I will bring them back and restore them
      to this place.”
  28:
    1: '¹ In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
      in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet
      from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests
      and all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke
      of the king of Babylon. '
    3: "³ Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the\
      \ Lord's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place\
      \ and carried to Babylon. "
    4: "⁴ I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king\
      \ of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, declares the\
      \ Lord, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence
      of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord, '
    6: '⁶ and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord make
      the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from
      Babylon the vessels of the house of the Lord, and all the exiles. '
    7: '⁷ Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of
      all the people. '
    8: '⁸ The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war,
      famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms. '
    9: "⁹ As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes\
      \ to pass, then it will be known that the Lord has truly sent the prophet.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah
      the prophet and broke them. '
    11: "¹¹ And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says\
      \ the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\
      \ from the neck of all the nations within two years.” But Jeremiah the prophet\
      \ went his way. \n"
    12: '¹² Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off
      the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “Go, tell Hananiah, ‘Thus says the Lord: You have broken wooden bars,
      but you have made in their place bars of iron. '
    14: '¹⁴ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the
      neck of all these nations an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
      and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.’” '
    15: '¹⁵ And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah,
      the Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face\
      \ of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion\
      \ against the Lord.’” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
  29:
    1: '¹ These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem
      to the surviving elders of the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and
      all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. '
    2: '² This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials
      of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from
      Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah
      the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon. It said: '
    4: '⁴ “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom
      I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: '
    5: '⁵ Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce. '
    6: '⁶ Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give
      your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply
      there, and do not decrease. '
    7: '⁷ But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray
      to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. '
    8: '⁸ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets
      and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams
      that they dream, '
    9: "⁹ for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send\
      \ them, declares the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “For thus says the Lord: When seventy years are completed for Babylon,
      I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to
      this place. '
    11: '¹¹ For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare
      and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. '
    12: '¹² Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. '
    13: '¹³ You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will be found by you, declares the Lord, and I will restore your fortunes\
      \ and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven\
      \ you, declares the Lord, and I will bring you back to the place from which\
      \ I sent you into exile. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Because you have said, ‘The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’ '
    16: '¹⁶ thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David,
      and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not
      go out with you into exile: '
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, behold, I am sending on them sword, famine,
      and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they
      cannot be eaten. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them
      a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing,
      and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, '
    19: '¹⁹ because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the Lord, that
      I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen,
      declares the Lord.’ '
    20: '²⁰ Hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem
      to Babylon: '
    21: '²¹ ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son
      of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you
      in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king
      of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes. '
    22: '²² Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah
      in Babylon: “The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon
      roasted in the fire,” '
    23: "²³ because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed\
      \ adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying\
      \ words that I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness,\
      \ declares the Lord.’” \n"
    24: '²⁴ To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say: '
    25: '²⁵ “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters
      in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son
      of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ ‘The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have
      charge in the house of the Lord over every madman who prophesies, to put him
      in the stocks and neck irons. '
    27: '²⁷ Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to
      you? '
    28: "²⁸ For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, “Your exile will be long; build\
      \ houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.”’” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    31: '³¹ “Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah
      of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him,
      and has made you trust in a lie, '
    32: '³² therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam
      and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, and
      he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the Lord, for
      he has spoken rebellion against the Lord.’”'
  30:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that
      I have spoken to you. '
    3: "³ For behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will restore the\
      \ fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the Lord, and I will bring them\
      \ back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession\
      \ of it.” \n"
    4: "⁴ These are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah: \n"
    5: "⁵ “Thus says the Lord:\nWe have heard a cry of panic,\n    of terror, and\
      \ no peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Ask now, and see,\n    can a man bear a child?\nWhy then do I see every\
      \ man\n    with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor?\n    Why has\
      \ every face turned pale?\n"
    7: "⁷ Alas! That day is so great\n    there is none like it;\nit is a time of\
      \ distress for Jacob;\n    yet he shall be saved out of it. \n"
    8: '⁸ “And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the Lord of hosts, that
      I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners
      shall no more make a servant of him. '
    9: "⁹ But they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will\
      \ raise up for them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the Lord,\n    nor be dismayed,\
      \ O Israel;\nfor behold, I will save you from far away,\n    and your offspring\
      \ from the land of their captivity.\nJacob shall return and have quiet and ease,\n\
      \    and none shall make him afraid.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with you to save you,\ndeclares the Lord;\nI will make a full\
      \ end of all the nations\n    among whom I scattered you,\n    but of you I\
      \ will not make a full end.\nI will discipline you in just measure,\n    and\
      \ I will by no means leave you unpunished. \n"
    12: "¹² “For thus says the Lord:\nYour hurt is incurable,\n    and your wound\
      \ is grievous.\n"
    13: "¹³ There is none to uphold your cause,\n    no medicine for your wound,\n\
      \    no healing for you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your lovers have forgotten you;\n    they care nothing for you;\n\
      for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy,\n    the punishment of a merciless\
      \ foe,\nbecause your guilt is great,\n    because your sins are flagrant.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you cry out over your hurt?\n    Your pain is incurable.\nBecause\
      \ your guilt is great,\n    because your sins are flagrant,\n    I have done\
      \ these things to you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,\n    and all your foes,\
      \ every one of them, shall go into captivity;\nthose who plunder you shall be\
      \ plundered,\n    and all who prey on you I will make a prey.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will restore health to you,\n    and your wounds I will heal,\n\
      declares the Lord,\nbecause they have called you an outcast:\n    ‘It is Zion,\
      \ for whom no one cares!’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Thus says the Lord:\nBehold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents\

    19: "¹⁹ Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving,\n    and the voices of those\
      \ who celebrate.\nI will multiply them, and they shall not be few;\n    I will\
      \ make them honored, and they shall not be small.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Their children shall be as they were of old,\n    and their congregation\
      \ shall be established before me,\n    and I will punish all who oppress them.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their prince shall be one of themselves;\n    their ruler shall come out\
      \ from their midst;\nI will make him draw near, and he shall approach me,\n\
      \    for who would dare of himself to approach me?\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    22: "²² And you shall be my people,\n    and I will be your God.” \n"
    23: "²³ Behold the storm of the Lord!\n    Wrath has gone forth,\na whirling tempest;\n\

  31:
    1: "¹ “At that time, declares the Lord, I will be the God of all the clans of\
      \ Israel, and they shall be my people.” \n"
    2: "² Thus says the Lord:\n“The people who survived the sword\n    found grace\

      \ of Ephraim:\n‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion,\n    to the Lord our God.’”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ For thus says the Lord:\n“Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob,\n    and raise\
      \ shouts for the chief of the nations;\nproclaim, give praise, and say,\n  \
      \  ‘O Lord, save your people,\n    the remnant of Israel.’\n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will bring them from the north country\n    and gather them from\
      \ the farthest parts of the earth,\namong them the blind and the lame,\n   \
      \ the pregnant woman and she who is in labor, together;\n    a great company,\
      \ they shall return here.\n"
    9: "⁹ With weeping they shall come,\n    and with pleas for mercy I will lead\
      \ them back,\nI will make them walk by brooks of water,\n    in a straight path\
      \ in which they shall not stumble,\nfor I am a father to Israel,\n    and Ephraim\
      \ is my firstborn. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Hear the word of the Lord, O nations,\n    and declare it in the coastlands\
      \ far away;\nsay, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,\n    and will keep\
      \ him as a shepherd keeps his flock.’\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the Lord has ransomed Jacob\n    and has redeemed him from hands too\
      \ strong for him.\n"
    12: "¹² They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion,\n    and they shall\
      \ be radiant over the goodness of the Lord,\nover the grain, the wine, and the\
      \ oil,\n    and over the young of the flock and the herd;\ntheir life shall\

      \ comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance,\n    and my people\
      \ shall be satisfied with my goodness,\ndeclares the Lord.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thus says the Lord:\n“A voice is heard in Ramah,\n    lamentation and\
      \ bitter weeping.\nRachel is weeping for her children;\n    she refuses to be\
      \ comforted for her children,\n    because they are no more.” \n"

    17: "¹⁷ There is hope for your future,\ndeclares the Lord,\n    and your children\

    19: "¹⁹ For after I had turned away, I relented,\n    and after I was instructed,\

      \ the disgrace of my youth.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is Ephraim my dear son?\n    Is he my darling child?\nFor as often as\

    21: "²¹ “Set up road markers for yourself;\n    make yourself guideposts;\nconsider\

    23: "²³ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Once more they shall\

      \ fortunes:\n“‘The Lord bless you, O habitation of righteousness,\n    O holy\

    24: '²⁴ And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and the farmers
      and those who wander with their flocks. '

    28: '²⁸ And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up
      and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring harm, so I will watch over
      them to build and to plant, declares the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ In those days they shall no longer say:\n“‘The fathers have eaten sour\
      \ grapes,\n    and the children's teeth are set on edge.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Each man who eats sour grapes,\

    31: '³¹ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new

    33: '³³ For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after
      those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write
      it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. '
    34: "³⁴ And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother,\

    38: '³⁸ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when the city shall be

    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah
      king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: '² At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and
      Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard that was in the palace
      of the king of Judah. '
    3: '³ For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy
      and say, ‘Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of
      the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it; '
    4: '⁴ Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans,
      but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak
      with him face to face and see him eye to eye. '
    5: "⁵ And he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I\
      \ visit him, declares the Lord. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you\
      \ shall not succeed’?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Jeremiah said, “The word of the Lord came to me: '
    7: '⁷ Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say,
      ‘Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is
      yours.’ '
    8: "⁸ Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance\
      \ with the word of the Lord, and said to me, ‘Buy my field that is at Anathoth\
      \ in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours;\
      \ buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed
      out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. '
    10: '¹⁰ I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on
      scales. '
    11: '¹¹ Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions
      and the open copy. '
    12: '¹² And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah,
      in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed
      the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting
      in the court of the guard. '
    13: '¹³ I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both
      this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware
      vessel, that they may last for a long time. '
    15: "¹⁵ For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields\
      \ and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I
      prayed to the Lord, saying: '
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Ah, Lord God! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your
      great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You show steadfast love to thousands, but you repay the guilt of fathers
      to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the Lord
      of hosts, '
    19: '¹⁹ great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways
      of the children of man, rewarding each one according to his ways and according
      to the fruit of his deeds. '
    20: '²⁰ You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day
      in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this
      day. '
    21: '²¹ You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and
      wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror. '
    22: '²² And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give
      them, a land flowing with milk and honey. '
    23: '²³ And they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your
      voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do.
      Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them. '
    24: '²⁴ Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because
      of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans
      who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you
      see it. '
    25: "²⁵ Yet you, O Lord God, have said to me, “Buy the field for money and get\
      \ witnesses”—though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is anything too hard for
      me? '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore, thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the
      hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
      and he shall capture it. '
    29: '²⁹ The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this
      city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been
      made to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke
      me to anger. '
    30: '³⁰ For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing
      but evil in my sight from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing
      but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to
      this day, so that I will remove it from my sight '
    32: '³² because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of
      Judah that they did to provoke me to anger—their kings and their officials,
      their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    33: '³³ They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have
      taught them persistently, they have not listened to receive instruction. '
    34: '³⁴ They set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name,
      to defile it. '
    35: "³⁵ They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom,\
      \ to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them,\
      \ nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause\
      \ Judah to sin. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “Now therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this
      city of which you say, ‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by
      sword, by famine, and by pestilence’: '
    37: '³⁷ Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them
      in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to
      this place, and I will make them dwell in safety. '
    38: '³⁸ And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. '
    39: '³⁹ I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever,
      for their own good and the good of their children after them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away
      from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that
      they may not turn from me. '
    41: "⁴¹ I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land\
      \ in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul. \n"
    42: '⁴² “For thus says the Lord: Just as I have brought all this great disaster
      upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them. '
    43: '⁴³ Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, ‘It is a
      desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ '
    44: ⁴⁴ Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed
      and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in
      the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the
      Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes,
      declares the Lord.”
  33:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still
      shut up in the court of the guard: '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord who made the earth, the Lord who formed it to establish
      it—the Lord is his name: '
    3: '³ Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things
      that you have not known. '
    4: '⁴ For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this
      city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense
      against the siege mounds and against the sword: '
    5: '⁵ They are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them with
      the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for
      I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil. '
    6: '⁶ Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and
      reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security. '
    7: '⁷ I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild
      them as they were at first. '
    8: '⁸ I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will
      forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me. '
    9: "⁹ And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before\
      \ all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for\
      \ them. They shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity\
      \ I provide for it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus says the Lord: In this place of which you say, ‘It is a waste without
      man or beast,’ in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are
      desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again '
    11: "¹¹ the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom\
      \ and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank\
      \ offerings to the house of the Lord:\n“‘Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,\n\
      \    for the Lord is good,\n    for his steadfast love endures forever!’\nFor\
      \ I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this place that is waste, without man
      or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds
      resting their flocks. '
    13: "¹³ In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and\
      \ in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem,\
      \ and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the\

    14: '¹⁴ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will fulfill the
      promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. '
    15: '¹⁵ In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring
      up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. '
    16: "¹⁶ In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely.\
      \ And this is the name by which it will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “For thus says the Lord: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne
      of the house of Israel, '
    18: "¹⁸ and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer\
      \ burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices forever.”\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    20: '²⁰ “Thus says the Lord: If you can break my covenant with the day and my
      covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed
      time, '
    21: '²¹ then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he
      shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical
      priests my ministers. '
    22: "²² As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot\
      \ be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the\
      \ Levitical priests who minister to me.” \n"
    23: '²³ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    24: '²⁴ “Have you not observed that these people are saying, ‘The Lord has rejected
      the two clans that he chose’? Thus they have despised my people so that they
      are no longer a nation in their sight. '
    25: '²⁵ Thus says the Lord: If I have not established my covenant with day and
      night and the fixed order of heaven and earth, '
    26: ²⁶ then I will reject the offspring of Jacob and David my servant and will
      not choose one of his offspring to rule over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac,
      and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king of
      Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion
      and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities: '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of
      Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into
      the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. '
    3: '³ You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered
      into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him
      face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.’ '
    4: '⁴ Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the Lord
      concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword. '
    5: "⁵ You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the\
      \ former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and\
      \ lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!”’ For I have spoken the word, declares\
      \ the Lord.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah,
      in Jerusalem, '
    7: "⁷ when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and\
      \ against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these\
      \ were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained. \n"
    8: '⁸ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made
      a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty
      to them, '
    9: '⁹ that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that
      no one should enslave a Jew, his brother. '
    10: '¹⁰ And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered
      into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so
      that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free. '
    11: '¹¹ But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves
      they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves. '
    12: '¹² The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    13: '¹³ “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with
      your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
      of slavery, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew
      who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free
      from your service.’ But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears
      to me. '
    15: '¹⁵ You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming
      liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house
      that is called by my name, '
    16: "¹⁶ but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took\
      \ back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their\
      \ desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Therefore, thus says the Lord: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming
      liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to
      you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the Lord. I
      will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of
      the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they
      cut in two and passed between its parts— '
    19: '¹⁹ the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests,
      and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf. '
    20: '²⁰ And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand
      of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds
      of the air and the beasts of the earth. '
    21: '²¹ And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand
      of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand
      of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you. '
    22: ²² Behold, I will command, declares the Lord, and will bring them back to
      this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire.
      I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.”
  35:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the
      son of Josiah, king of Judah: '
    2: '² “Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to
      the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.” '
    3: '³ So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers
      and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites. '
    4: '⁴ I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of
      Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the
      officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold. '
    5: '⁵ Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I
      said to them, “Drink wine.” '
    6: '⁶ But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab,
      our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons
      forever. '
    7: '⁷ You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant
      or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may
      live many days in the land where you sojourn.’ '
    8: '⁸ We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all
      that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our
      sons, or our daughters, '
    9: '⁹ and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed, '
    10: '¹⁰ but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our
      father commanded us. '
    11: "¹¹ But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said,\
      \ ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and\
      \ the army of the Syrians.’ So we are living in Jerusalem.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people
      of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction
      and listen to my words? declares the Lord. '
    14: "¹⁴ The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink\
      \ no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed\
      \ their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not\
      \ listened to me. "
    15: '¹⁵ I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently,
      saying, ‘Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds,
      and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the
      land that I gave to you and your fathers.’ But you did not incline your ear
      or listen to me. '
    16: '¹⁶ The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their
      father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me. '
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold,\
      \ I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster\
      \ that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they\
      \ have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the Lord
      of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab
      your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you, '
    19: '¹⁹ therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the
      son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me.”'
  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word
      came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² “Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against
      Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the
      days of Josiah until today. '
    3: "³ It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend\
      \ to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may\
      \ forgive their iniquity and their sin.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll
      at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord that he had spoken to
      him. '
    5: '⁵ And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, “I am banned from going to the house
      of the Lord, '
    6: "⁶ so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people\
      \ in the Lord's house you shall read the words of the Lord from the scroll that\
      \ you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing\
      \ of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities. "
    7: '⁷ It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the Lord, and that
      every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that
      the Lord has pronounced against this people.” '
    8: "⁸ And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him\
      \ about reading from the scroll the words of the Lord in the Lord's house. \n"
    9: '⁹ In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the
      ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the
      cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah\
      \ from the scroll, in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah the\
      \ son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of\
      \ the New Gate of the Lord's house. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words
      of the Lord from the scroll, '
    12: "¹² he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and all\
      \ the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son\
      \ of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah\
      \ the son of Hananiah, and all the officials. "
    13: '¹³ And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read
      the scroll in the hearing of the people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah,
      son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read
      in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the
      scroll in his hand and came to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them. '
    16: '¹⁶ When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And
      they said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these
      words? Was it at his dictation?” '
    18: '¹⁸ Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote
      them with ink on the scroll.” '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and\
      \ let no one know where you are.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the
      chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king. '
    21: '²¹ Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber
      of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials
      who stood beside the king. '
    22: '²² It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house,
      and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him. '
    23: '²³ As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with
      a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll
      was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot. '
    24: '²⁴ Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words
      was afraid, nor did they tear their garments. '
    25: '²⁵ Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn
      the scroll, he would not listen to them. '
    26: "²⁶ And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of\
      \ Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah\
      \ the prophet, but the Lord hid them. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote\
      \ at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "
    28: '²⁸ “Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in
      the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. '
    29: '²⁹ And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the Lord,
      You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written in it that the king
      of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from
      it man and beast?” '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall
      have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out
      to the heat by day and the frost by night. '
    31: "³¹ And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity.\
      \ I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the\
      \ people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but\
      \ they would not hear.’” \n"
    32: ³² Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the
      son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of
      the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar
      words were added to them.
  37:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king
      in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim. '
    2: "² But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the\
      \ words of the Lord that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet. \n"
    3: '³ King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest,
      the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray for us to
      the Lord our God.” '
    4: '⁴ Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not
      yet been put in prison. '
    5: "⁵ The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were\
      \ besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet: '
    7: "⁷ “Thus says the Lord, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah\
      \ who sent you to me to inquire of me, ‘Behold, Pharaoh's army that came to\
      \ help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land. "
    8: '⁸ And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. They shall
      capture it and burn it with fire. '
    9: '⁹ Thus says the Lord, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will
      surely go away from us,” for they will not go away. '
    10: "¹⁰ For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting\
      \ against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his\
      \ tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach\
      \ of Pharaoh's army, "
    12: '¹² Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive
      his portion there among the people. '
    13: '¹³ When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son
      of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are
      deserting to the Chaldeans.” '
    14: '¹⁴ And Jeremiah said, “It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.”
      But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the
      officials. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned\
      \ him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days, '
    17: '¹⁷ King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly
      in his house and said, “Is there any word from the Lord?” Jeremiah said, “There
      is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” '
    18: '¹⁸ Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or
      your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon
      will not come against you and against this land’? '
    20: '²⁰ Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you
      and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.” '
    21: ²¹ So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court
      of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street,
      until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court
      of the guard.
  38:
    1: '¹ Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the
      son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah
      was saying to all the people: '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by
      famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live.
      He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live. '
    3: '³ Thus says the Lord: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the
      army of the king of Babylon and be taken.” '
    4: '⁴ Then the officials said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for
      he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the
      hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not
      seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.” '
    5: '⁵ King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing
      against you.” '
    6: "⁶ So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's\
      \ son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes.\
      \ And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in\
      \ the mud. \n"
    7: "⁷ When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard\
      \ that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting in the Benjamin\
      \ Gate— "
    8: "⁸ Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king, "
    9: '⁹ “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah
      the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger,
      for there is no bread left in the city.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, “Take thirty men with
      you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.” '
    11: '¹¹ So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king,
      to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes,
      which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes. '
    12: '¹² Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes
      between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so. '
    13: "¹³ Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern.\
      \ And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third
      entrance of the temple of the Lord. The king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you
      a question; hide nothing from me.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely put me
      to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.” '
    16: "¹⁶ Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As the Lord lives, who\
      \ made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of\
      \ these men who seek your life.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts,
      the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon,
      then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire,
      and you and your house shall live. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then
      this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn
      it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.” '
    19: '¹⁹ King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted
      to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.” '
    20: '²⁰ Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of
      the Lord in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life
      shall be spared. '
    21: '²¹ But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the Lord has
      shown to me: '
    22: "²² Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being\
      \ led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying,\n“‘Your trusted\
      \ friends have deceived you\n    and prevailed against you;\nnow that your feet\
      \ are sunk in the mud,\n    they turn away from you.’ \n"
    23: "²³ All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you\
      \ yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king\
      \ of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you
      shall not die. '
    25: '²⁵ If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and
      say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you;
      hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’ '
    26: '²⁶ then you shall say to them, ‘I made a humble plea to the king that he
      would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’” '
    27: '²⁷ Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered
      them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for
      the conversation had not been overheard. '
    28: ²⁸ And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem
      was taken.
  39:
    1: '¹ In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it. '
    2: '² In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day
      of the month, a breach was made in the city. '
    3: '³ Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle
      gate: Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar, Nebu-sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer
      the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going\
      \ out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between\
      \ the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah. "
    5: '⁵ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the
      plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on
      him. '
    6: '⁶ The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his
      eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: '⁷ He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon. '
    8: "⁸ The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke\
      \ down the walls of Jerusalem. "
    9: '⁹ Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon
      the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to
      him, and the people who remained. '
    10: "¹⁰ Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some\
      \ of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at\
      \ the same time. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through
      Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him
      as he tells you.” '
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer
      the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon '
    14: "¹⁴ sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him\
      \ to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home.\
      \ So he lived among the people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court
      of the guard: '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts,
      the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm
      and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will deliver you on that day, declares the Lord, and you shall not
      be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. '
    18: ¹⁸ For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you
      shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me,
      declares the Lord.’”
  40:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain
      of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along
      with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. '
    2: '² The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God
      pronounced this disaster against this place. '
    3: '³ The Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned
      against the Lord and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you. '
    4: '⁴ Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems
      good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well,
      but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the
      whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. '
    5: '⁵ If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
      whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell
      with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the
      captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him
      go. '
    6: "⁶ Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with\
      \ him among the people who were left in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard
      that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in
      the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest
      of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon, '
    8: '⁸ they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the
      son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite,
      Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. '
    9: '⁹ Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men,
      saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve
      the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans
      who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil,
      and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” '
    11: '¹¹ Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites
      and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant
      in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor
      over them, '
    12: "¹² then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been\
      \ driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered\
      \ wine and summer fruits in great abundance. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the
      open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah '
    14: '¹⁴ and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has
      sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of
      Ahikam would not believe them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Please
      let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know
      it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about
      you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?” '
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You
      shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.”
  41:
    1: '¹ In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of
      the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to
      Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah, '
    2: '² Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck
      down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed
      him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah,\
      \ and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there. \n"
    4: '⁴ On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it, '
    5: '⁵ eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards
      shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings
      and incense to present at the temple of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping
      as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of
      Ahikam.” '
    7: '⁷ When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with
      him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern. '
    8: "⁸ But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to\
      \ death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.”\
      \ So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men
      whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King
      Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
      filled it with the slain. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah,\
      \ the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan,\
      \ the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael\
      \ the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with
      him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, '
    12: '¹² they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah.
      They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah
      and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced. '
    14: '¹⁴ So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned
      around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. '
    15: '¹⁵ But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,
      and went to the Ammonites. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with
      him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael
      the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—soldiers,
      women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to
      go to Egypt '
    18: ¹⁸ because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
      the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king
      of Babylon had made governor over the land.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and
      Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest,
      came near '
    2: '² and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let our plea for mercy come before you,
      and pray to the Lord your God for us, for all this remnant—because we are left
      with but a few, as your eyes see us— '
    3: '³ that the Lord your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that
      we should do.” '
    4: '⁴ Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray
      to the Lord your God according to your request, and whatever the Lord answers
      you I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you.” '
    5: '⁵ Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness
      against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the Lord your
      God sends you to us. '
    6: "⁶ Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to\
      \ whom we are sending you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice\
      \ of the Lord our God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ At the end of ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the
      forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest, '
    9: '⁹ and said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent
      me to present your plea for mercy before him: '
    10: '¹⁰ If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull
      you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I relent of the disaster
      that I did to you. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not fear him,
      declares the Lord, for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his
      hand. '
    12: '¹² I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain
      in your own land. '
    13: '¹³ But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice
      of the Lord your God '
    14: '¹⁴ and saying, ‘No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see
      war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell
      there,’ '
    15: '¹⁵ then hear the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the Lord
      of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to
      live there, '
    16: '¹⁶ then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt,
      and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt,
      and there you shall die. '
    17: "¹⁷ All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die\
      \ by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have no remnant or\
      \ survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my
      wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured
      out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an execration, a horror, a
      curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more. '
    19: '¹⁹ The Lord has said to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Know
      for a certainty that I have warned you this day '
    20: '²⁰ that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to
      the Lord your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the Lord our God, and whatever the
      Lord our God says, declare to us and we will do it.’ '
    21: '²¹ And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice
      of the Lord your God in anything that he sent me to tell you. '
    22: ²² Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by
      famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.”
  43:
    1: '¹ When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the
      Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, '
    2: '² Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the insolent
      men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send
      you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to live there,’ '
    3: '³ but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into
      the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.” '
    4: '⁴ So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all
      the people did not obey the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Judah. '
    5: '⁵ But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took
      all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from
      all the nations to which they had been driven— '
    6: '⁶ the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom
      Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
      son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. '
    7: "⁷ And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of\
      \ the Lord. And they arrived at Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes: '
    9: "⁹ “Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement\
      \ that is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of\
      \ the men of Judah, "
    10: '¹⁰ and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold,
      I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will
      set his throne above these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his
      royal canopy over them. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall come and strike the land of Egypt, giving over to the pestilence
      those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to
      captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword. '
    12: '¹² I shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall
      burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall clean the land of Egypt
      as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin, and he shall go away from there in
      peace. '
    13: ¹³ He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt,
      and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.’”
  44:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the
      land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster
      that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, this
      day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them, '
    3: '³ because of the evil that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that
      they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they knew not, neither
      they, nor you, nor your fathers. '
    4: '⁴ Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, ‘Oh,
      do not do this abomination that I hate!’ '
    5: '⁵ But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their evil and
      make no offerings to other gods. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities
      of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a waste and a desolation,
      as at this day. '
    7: '⁷ And now thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit
      this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, infant
      and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no remnant? '
    8: '⁸ Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings
      to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, so that you
      may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth? '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers, the evil of the kings of Judah,
      the evil of their wives, your own evil, and the evil of your wives, which they
      committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ They have not humbled themselves even to this day, nor have they feared,\
      \ nor walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your\
      \ fathers. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will
      set my face against you for harm, to cut off all Judah. '
    12: '¹² I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come to the
      land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed. In the land of Egypt
      they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall be consumed. From the
      least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine, and they shall
      become an oath, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. '
    13: '¹³ I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished
      Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, '
    14: "¹⁴ so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land\
      \ of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which\
      \ they desire to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, except some\
      \ fugitives.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other
      gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived
      in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah: '
    16: '¹⁶ “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we
      will not listen to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ But we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the queen
      of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we did, both we and our fathers,
      our kings and our officials, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.
      For then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no disaster. '
    18: '¹⁸ But since we left off making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring
      out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed
      by the sword and by famine.” '
    19: "¹⁹ And the women said, “When we made offerings to the queen of heaven and\
      \ poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands' approval that\
      \ we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to\
      \ her?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who
      had given him this answer: '
    21: '²¹ “As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the
      streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and
      the people of the land, did not the Lord remember them? Did it not come into
      his mind? '
    22: '²² The Lord could no longer bear your evil deeds and the abominations that
      you committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation and a waste and a
      curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day. '
    23: "²³ It is because you made offerings and because you sinned against the Lord\
      \ and did not obey the voice of the Lord or walk in his law and in his statutes\
      \ and in his testimonies that this disaster has happened to you, as at this\
      \ day.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of the
      Lord, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt. '
    25: '²⁵ Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have
      declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, ‘We
      will surely perform our vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen
      of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Then confirm your vows and
      perform your vows! '
    26: '²⁶ Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who dwell in the
      land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the Lord, that my
      name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land
      of Egypt, saying, ‘As the Lord God lives.’ '
    27: '²⁷ Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. All the
      men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and
      by famine, until there is an end of them. '
    28: '²⁸ And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to
      the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to
      the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs. '
    29: '²⁹ This shall be the sign to you, declares the Lord, that I will punish you
      in this place, in order that you may know that my words will surely stand against
      you for harm: '
    30: ³⁰ Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into
      the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave
      Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who
      was his enemy and sought his life.”
  45:
    1: '¹ The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when
      he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year
      of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: '
    2: '² “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: '
    3: '³ You said, ‘Woe is me! For the Lord has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary
      with my groaning, and I find no rest.’ '
    4: '⁴ Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the Lord: Behold, what I have built
      I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up—that is, the whole
      land. '
    5: ⁵ And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, I am
      bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the Lord. But I will give you your
