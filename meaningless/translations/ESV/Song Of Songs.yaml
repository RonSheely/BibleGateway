      \ of Kedar,\n    like the curtains of Solomon.\n"
    6: "⁶ Do not gaze at me because I am dark,\n    because the sun has looked upon\
      \ me.\nMy mother's sons were angry with me;\n    they made me keeper of the\
      \ vineyards,\n    but my own vineyard I have not kept!\n"
    7: "⁷ Tell me, you whom my soul loves,\n    where you pasture your flock,\n  \

      \    bounding over the hills.\n"
    9: "⁹ My beloved is like a gazelle\n    or a young stag.\nBehold, there he stands\n\
      \    behind our wall,\ngazing through the windows,\n    looking through the\
      \ lattice.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ My beloved speaks and says to me:\n“Arise, my love, my beautiful one,\n\
      \    and come away,\n"

      \ sealed.\n"
    13: "¹³ Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates\n    with all choicest fruits,\n\
      \    henna with nard,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,\n    with all trees of frankincense,\n\

      \ is strong as death,\n    jealousy is fierce as the grave.\nIts flashes are\
      \ flashes of fire,\n    the very flame of the Lord.\n"
    7: "⁷ Many waters cannot quench love,\n    neither can floods drown it.\nIf a\
      \ man offered for love\n    all the wealth of his house,\n    he would be utterly\
      \ despised. \n"
    8: "⁸ We have a little sister,\n    and she has no breasts.\nWhat shall we do\
      \ for our sister\n    on the day when she is spoken for?\n"
    9: "⁹ If she is a wall,\n    we will build on her a battlement of silver,\nbut\
      \ if she is a door,\n    we will enclose her with boards of cedar. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I was a wall,\n    and my breasts were like towers;\nthen I was in his\
      \ eyes\n    as one who finds peace. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;\n    he let out the vineyard to\
      \ keepers;\n    each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.\n"
