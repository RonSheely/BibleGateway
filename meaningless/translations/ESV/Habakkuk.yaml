Habakkuk:
  1:
    1: "¹ The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw. \n"
    2: "² O Lord, how long shall I cry for help,\n    and you will not hear?\nOr cry\
      \ to you “Violence!”\n    and you will not save?\n"
    3: "³ Why do you make me see iniquity,\n    and why do you idly look at wrong?\n\
      Destruction and violence are before me;\n    strife and contention arise.\n"
    4: "⁴ So the law is paralyzed,\n    and justice never goes forth.\nFor the wicked\
      \ surround the righteous;\n    so justice goes forth perverted. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Look among the nations, and see;\n    wonder and be astounded.\nFor I am\
      \ doing a work in your days\n    that you would not believe if told.\n"
    6: "⁶ For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans,\n    that bitter and hasty nation,\n\
      who march through the breadth of the earth,\n    to seize dwellings not their\
      \ own.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are dreaded and fearsome;\n    their justice and dignity go forth from\
      \ themselves.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their horses are swifter than leopards,\n    more fierce than the evening\
      \ wolves;\n    their horsemen press proudly on.\nTheir horsemen come from afar;\n\
      \    they fly like an eagle swift to devour.\n"
    9: "⁹ They all come for violence,\n    all their faces forward.\n    They gather\
      \ captives like sand.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ At kings they scoff,\n    and at rulers they laugh.\nThey laugh at every\
      \ fortress,\n    for they pile up earth and take it.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then they sweep by like the wind and go on,\n    guilty men, whose own\
      \ might is their god!” \n"
    12: "¹² Are you not from everlasting,\n    O Lord my God, my Holy One?\n    We\
      \ shall not die.\nO Lord, you have ordained them as a judgment,\n    and you,\
      \ O Rock, have established them for reproof.\n"
    13: "¹³ You who are of purer eyes than to see evil\n    and cannot look at wrong,\n\
      why do you idly look at traitors\n    and remain silent when the wicked swallows\
      \ up\n    the man more righteous than he?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You make mankind like the fish of the sea,\n    like crawling things that\
      \ have no ruler.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He brings all of them up with a hook;\n    he drags them out with his\
      \ net;\nhe gathers them in his dragnet;\n    so he rejoices and is glad.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore he sacrifices to his net\n    and makes offerings to his dragnet;\n\
      for by them he lives in luxury,\n    and his food is rich.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Is he then to keep on emptying his net\n    and mercilessly killing nations\
      \ forever?"
  2:
    1: "¹ I will take my stand at my watchpost\n    and station myself on the tower,\n\
      and look out to see what he will say to me,\n    and what I will answer concerning\
      \ my complaint. \n"
    2: "² And the Lord answered me:\n“Write the vision;\n    make it plain on tablets,\n\
      \    so he may run who reads it.\n"
    3: "³ For still the vision awaits its appointed time;\n    it hastens to the end—it\
      \ will not lie.\nIf it seems slow, wait for it;\n    it will surely come; it\
      \ will not delay. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,\n    but the\
      \ righteous shall live by his faith. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Moreover, wine is a traitor,\n    an arrogant man who is never at rest.\n\
      His greed is as wide as Sheol;\n    like death he has never enough.\nHe gathers\
      \ for himself all nations\n    and collects as his own all peoples.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Shall not all these take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles\
      \ for him, and say,\n“Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own—\n    for\
      \ how long?—\n    and loads himself with pledges!”\n"
    7: "⁷ Will not your debtors suddenly arise,\n    and those awake who will make\
      \ you tremble?\n    Then you will be spoil for them.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because you have plundered many nations,\n    all the remnant of the peoples\
      \ shall plunder you,\nfor the blood of man and violence to the earth,\n    to\
      \ cities and all who dwell in them. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,\n    to set his nest on high,\n\
      \    to be safe from the reach of harm!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You have devised shame for your house\n    by cutting off many peoples;\n\
      \    you have forfeited your life.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the stone will cry out from the wall,\n    and the beam from the woodwork\
      \ respond. \n"
    12: "¹² “Woe to him who builds a town with blood\n    and founds a city on iniquity!\n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, is it not from the Lord of hosts\n    that peoples labor merely\
      \ for fire,\n    and nations weary themselves for nothing?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the earth will be filled\n    with the knowledge of the glory of the\
      \ Lord\n    as the waters cover the sea. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink—\n    you pour out your wrath\
      \ and make them drunk,\n    in order to gaze at their nakedness!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You will have your fill of shame instead of glory.\n    Drink, yourself,\
      \ and show your uncircumcision!\nThe cup in the Lord's right hand\n    will\
      \ come around to you,\n    and utter shame will come upon your glory!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,\n    as will the destruction\
      \ of the beasts that terrified them,\nfor the blood of man and violence to the\
      \ earth,\n    to cities and all who dwell in them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “What profit is an idol\n    when its maker has shaped it,\n    a metal\
      \ image, a teacher of lies?\nFor its maker trusts in his own creation\n    when\
      \ he makes speechless idols!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake;\n    to a silent stone,\
      \ Arise!\nCan this teach?\nBehold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,\n  \
      \  and there is no breath at all in it.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord is in his holy temple;\n    let all the earth keep silence\
      \ before him.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth. \n"
    2: "² O Lord, I have heard the report of you,\n    and your work, O Lord, do I\
      \ fear.\nIn the midst of the years revive it;\n    in the midst of the years\
      \ make it known;\n    in wrath remember mercy.\n"
    3: "³ God came from Teman,\n    and the Holy One from Mount Paran. \nHis splendor\
      \ covered the heavens,\n    and the earth was full of his praise.\n"
    4: "⁴ His brightness was like the light;\n    rays flashed from his hand;\n  \
      \  and there he veiled his power.\n"
    5: "⁵ Before him went pestilence,\n    and plague followed at his heels.\n"
    6: "⁶ He stood and measured the earth;\n    he looked and shook the nations;\n\
      then the eternal mountains were scattered;\n    the everlasting hills sank low.\n\
      \    His were the everlasting ways.\n"
    7: "⁷ I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;\n    the curtains of the land of\
      \ Midian did tremble.\n"
    8: "⁸ Was your wrath against the rivers, O Lord?\n    Was your anger against the\
      \ rivers,\n    or your indignation against the sea,\nwhen you rode on your horses,\n\
      \    on your chariot of salvation?\n"
    9: "⁹ You stripped the sheath from your bow,\n    calling for many arrows. \n\
      \    You split the earth with rivers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The mountains saw you and writhed;\n    the raging waters swept on;\n\
      the deep gave forth its voice;\n    it lifted its hands on high.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The sun and moon stood still in their place\n    at the light of your\
      \ arrows as they sped,\n    at the flash of your glittering spear.\n"
    12: "¹² You marched through the earth in fury;\n    you threshed the nations in\
      \ anger.\n"
    13: "¹³ You went out for the salvation of your people,\n    for the salvation\
      \ of your anointed.\nYou crushed the head of the house of the wicked,\n    laying\
      \ him bare from thigh to neck. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors,\n    who came\
      \ like a whirlwind to scatter me,\n    rejoicing as if to devour the poor in\
      \ secret.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You trampled the sea with your horses,\n    the surging of mighty waters.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I hear, and my body trembles;\n    my lips quiver at the sound;\nrottenness\
      \ enters into my bones;\n    my legs tremble beneath me.\nYet I will quietly\
      \ wait for the day of trouble\n    to come upon people who invade us. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Though the fig tree should not blossom,\n    nor fruit be on the vines,\n\
      the produce of the olive fail\n    and the fields yield no food,\nthe flock\
      \ be cut off from the fold\n    and there be no herd in the stalls,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ yet I will rejoice in the Lord;\n    I will take joy in the God of my\
      \ salvation.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ God, the Lord, is my strength;\n    he makes my feet like the deer's;\n\
      \    he makes me tread on my high places.\nTo the choirmaster: with stringed\
      \ instruments."
