2 John:
  1:
    1: '¹ The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and
      not only I, but also all who know the truth, '
    2: "² because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: \n"
    3: "³ Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus\
      \ Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love. \n"
    4: '⁴ I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just
      as we were commanded by the Father. '
    5: '⁵ And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment,
      but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. '
    6: '⁶ And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the
      commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk
      in it. '
    7: '⁷ For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess
      the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the
      antichrist. '
    8: '⁸ Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but
      may win a full reward. '
    9: '⁹ Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ,
      does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the
      Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive
      him into your house or give him any greeting, '
    11: "¹¹ for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works. \n"
    12: "¹² Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink.\
      \ Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be\
      \ complete. \n"
    13: ¹³ The children of your elect sister greet you.
