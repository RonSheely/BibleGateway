    27: "²⁷ And they lodged around the house of God, for on them lay the duty of watching,\
      \ and they had charge of opening it every morning. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Some of them had charge of the utensils of service, for they were required
      to count them when they were brought in and taken out. '
    29: '²⁹ Others of them were appointed over the furniture and over all the holy
      utensils, also over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the incense, and the
      spices. '
    30: '³⁰ Others, of the sons of the priests, prepared the mixing of the spices, '
    31: '³¹ and Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite,
      was entrusted with making the flat cakes. '
    32: "³² Also some of their kinsmen of the Kohathites had charge of the showbread,\
      \ to prepare it every Sabbath. \n"
    33: "³³ Now these, the singers, the heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, were\
      \ in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were on duty\
      \ day and night. "
    34: "³⁴ These were heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, according to their\
      \ generations, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem. \n"
    35: '³⁵ In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife
      was Maacah, '
    36: '³⁶ and his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, '
    37: '³⁷ Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth; '
    38: '³⁸ and Mikloth was the father of Shimeam; and these also lived opposite their
      kinsmen in Jerusalem, with their kinsmen. '
    39: '³⁹ Ner fathered Kish, Kish fathered Saul, Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-shua,
      Abinadab, and Eshbaal. '
    40: '⁴⁰ And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal, and Merib-baal fathered Micah. '
    41: '⁴¹ The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. '
    42: '⁴² And Ahaz fathered Jarah, and Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri.
      And Zimri fathered Moza. '
    43: '⁴³ Moza fathered Binea, and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his
      son. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Azel had six sons and these are their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael,
      Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these were the sons of Azel.'
  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before
      the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. '
    2: '² And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck
      down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. '
    3: '³ The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he
      was wounded by the archers. '
    4: '⁴ Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through
      with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me.” But his armor-bearer
      would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell
      upon it. '
    5: '⁵ And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his
      sword and died. '
    6: '⁶ Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together. '
    7: "⁷ And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army\
      \ had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities\
      \ and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them. \n"
    8: '⁸ The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul
      and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. '
    9: '⁹ And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers
      throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols
      and to the people. '
    10: '¹⁰ And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head
      in the temple of Dagon. '
    11: '¹¹ But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to
      Saul, '
    12: "¹² all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies\
      \ of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under\
      \ the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days. \n"
    13: '¹³ So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the Lord in
      that he did not keep the command of the Lord, and also consulted a medium, seeking
      guidance. '
    14: ¹⁴ He did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death
      and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, “Behold,
      we are your bone and flesh. '
    2: '² In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought
      in Israel. And the Lord your God said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people
      Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’” '
    3: "³ So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a\
      \ covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king\
      \ over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. \n"
    4: '⁴ And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites
      were, the inhabitants of the land. '
    5: '⁵ The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless,
      David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. '
    6: '⁶ David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander.”
      And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. '
    7: '⁷ And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David. '
    8: '⁸ And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and
      Joab repaired the rest of the city. '
    9: "⁹ And David became greater and greater, for the Lord of hosts was with him.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now these are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who gave him strong support\
      \ in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the\
      \ word of the Lord concerning Israel. "
    11: "¹¹ This is an account of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was\
      \ chief of the three. He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one\
      \ time. \n"
    12: '¹² And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo,
      the Ahohite. '
    13: '¹³ He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there
      for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from
      the Philistines. '
    14: "¹⁴ But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed\
      \ the Philistines. And the Lord saved them by a great victory. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave
      of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. '
    16: '¹⁶ David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines
      was then at Bethlehem. '
    17: '¹⁷ And David said longingly, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink
      from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” '
    18: '¹⁸ Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and
      drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and
      brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the Lord '
    19: "¹⁹ and said, “Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall\
      \ I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought\
      \ it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded
      his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three. '
    21: "²¹ He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but\
      \ he did not attain to the three. \n"
    22: '²² And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of
      great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck
      down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. '
    23: "²³ And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall.\
      \ The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam, but Benaiah went\
      \ down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand\
      \ and killed him with his own spear. "
    24: '²⁴ These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the
      three mighty men. '
    25: "²⁵ He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three.\
      \ And David set him over his bodyguard. \n"
    26: '²⁶ The mighty men were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo
      of Bethlehem, '
    27: '²⁷ Shammoth of Harod, Helez the Pelonite, '
    28: '²⁸ Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, Abiezer of Anathoth, '
    29: '²⁹ Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, '
    30: '³⁰ Maharai of Netophah, Heled the son of Baanah of Netophah, '
    31: '³¹ Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the people of Benjamin, Benaiah of
      Pirathon, '
    32: '³² Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, '
    33: '³³ Azmaveth of Baharum, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, '
    34: '³⁴ Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, '
    35: '³⁵ Ahiam the son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, '
    36: '³⁶ Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, '
    37: '³⁷ Hezro of Carmel, Naarai the son of Ezbai, '
    38: '³⁸ Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, '
    39: '³⁹ Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son
      of Zeruiah, '
    40: '⁴⁰ Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, '
    41: '⁴¹ Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, '
    42: '⁴² Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and
      thirty with him, '
    43: '⁴³ Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, '
    44: '⁴⁴ Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, '
    45: '⁴⁵ Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, '
    46: '⁴⁶ Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and
      Ithmah the Moabite, '
    47: ⁴⁷ Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move
      about freely because of Saul the son of Kish. And they were among the mighty
      men who helped him in war. '
    2: "² They were bowmen and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the\
      \ right or the left hand; they were Benjaminites, Saul's kinsmen. "
    3: '³ The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; also
      Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu of Anathoth, '
    4: '⁴ Ishmaiah of Gibeon, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader over the
      thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad of Gederah, '
    5: '⁵ Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite; '
    6: '⁶ Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; '
    7: "⁷ And Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. \n"
    8: '⁸ From the Gadites there went over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness
      mighty and experienced warriors, expert with shield and spear, whose faces were
      like the faces of lions and who were swift as gazelles upon the mountains: '
    9: '⁹ Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third, '
    10: '¹⁰ Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, '
    11: '¹¹ Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, '
    12: '¹² Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, '
    13: '¹³ Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh. '
    14: '¹⁴ These Gadites were officers of the army; the least was a match for a hundred
      men and the greatest for a thousand. '
    15: "¹⁵ These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was\
      \ overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to\
      \ the east and to the west. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. '
    17: '¹⁷ David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me
      in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me
      to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God
      of our fathers see and rebuke you.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said,\n“We\
      \ are yours, O David,\n    and with you, O son of Jesse!\nPeace, peace to you,\n\
      \    and peace to your helpers!\n    For your God helps you.”\nThen David received\
      \ them and made them officers of his troops. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines
      for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the
      Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, “At peril to our heads he
      will desert to his master Saul.”) '
    20: '²⁰ As he went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad,
      Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh. '
    21: '²¹ They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty
      men of valor and were commanders in the army. '
    22: "²² For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great\
      \ army, like an army of God. \n"
    23: '²³ These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops who came to
      David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word
      of the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ The men of Judah bearing shield and spear were 6,800 armed troops. '
    25: '²⁵ Of the Simeonites, mighty men of valor for war, 7,100. '
    26: '²⁶ Of the Levites 4,600. '
    27: '²⁷ The prince Jehoiada, of the house of Aaron, and with him 3,700. '
    28: "²⁸ Zadok, a young man mighty in valor, and twenty-two commanders from his\
      \ own fathers' house. "
    29: '²⁹ Of the Benjaminites, the kinsmen of Saul, 3,000, of whom the majority
      had to that point kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. '
    30: "³⁰ Of the Ephraimites 20,800, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers'\
      \ houses. "
    31: '³¹ Of the half-tribe of Manasseh 18,000, who were expressly named to come
      and make David king. '
    32: '³² Of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel
      ought to do, 200 chiefs, and all their kinsmen under their command. '
    33: '³³ Of Zebulun 50,000 seasoned troops, equipped for battle with all the weapons
      of war, to help David with singleness of purpose. '
    34: '³⁴ Of Naphtali 1,000 commanders with whom were 37,000 men armed with shield
      and spear. '
    35: '³⁵ Of the Danites 28,600 men equipped for battle. '
    36: '³⁶ Of Asher 40,000 seasoned troops ready for battle. '
    37: "³⁷ Of the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh from beyond\
      \ the Jordan, 120,000 men armed with all the weapons of war. \n"
    38: '³⁸ All these, men of war, arrayed in battle order, came to Hebron with a
      whole heart to make David king over all Israel. Likewise, all the rest of Israel
      were of a single mind to make David king. '
    39: '³⁹ And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for
      their brothers had made preparation for them. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And also their relatives, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali,
      came bringing food on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant
      provisions of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen
      and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
  13:
    1: '¹ David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every
      leader. '
    2: '² And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and
      from the Lord our God, let us send abroad to our brothers who remain in all
      the lands of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in the cities that
      have pasturelands, that they may be gathered to us. '
    3: '³ Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it
      in the days of Saul.” '
    4: "⁴ All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of\
      \ all the people. \n"
    5: '⁵ So David assembled all Israel from the Nile of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to
      bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. '
    6: '⁶ And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim that
      belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by
      the name of the Lord who sits enthroned above the cherubim. '
    7: '⁷ And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab,
      and Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart. '
    8: "⁸ And David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might,\
      \ with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets. \n"
    9: '⁹ And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand
      to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him
      down because he put out his hand to the ark, and he died there before God. '
    11: '¹¹ And David was angry because the Lord had broken out against Uzzah. And
      that place is called Perez-uzza to this day. '
    12: '¹² And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, “How can I bring the
      ark of God home to me?” '
    13: '¹³ So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it
      aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. '
    14: ¹⁴ And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house
      three months. And the Lord blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he
      had.
  14:
    1: '¹ And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also masons
      and carpenters to build a house for him. '
    2: "² And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and\
      \ that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel. \n"
    3: '³ And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and
      daughters. '
    4: '⁴ These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab,
      Nathan, Solomon, '
    5: '⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, '
    6: '⁶ Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, '
    7: "⁷ Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet. \n"
    8: '⁸ When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel,
      all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went
      out against them. '
    9: '⁹ Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. '
    10: '¹⁰ And David inquired of God, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will
      you give them into my hand?” And the Lord said to him, “Go up, and I will give
      them into your hand.” '
    11: '¹¹ And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And
      David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood.”
      Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim. '
    12: "¹² And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were\
      \ burned. \n"
    13: '¹³ And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. '
    14: '¹⁴ And when David again inquired of God, God said to him, “You shall not
      go up after them; go around and come against them opposite the balsam trees. '
    15: '¹⁵ And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees,
      then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike down the army
      of the Philistines.” '
    16: '¹⁶ And David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine
      army from Gibeon to Gezer. '
    17: ¹⁷ And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the
      fear of him upon all nations.
  15:
    1: '¹ David built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place
      for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. '
    2: '² Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for
      the Lord had chosen them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister to him
      forever. '
    3: '³ And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord
      to its place, which he had prepared for it. '
    4: '⁴ And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: '
    5: '⁵ of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers; '
    6: '⁶ of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers; '
    7: '⁷ of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers; '
    8: '⁸ of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers; '
    9: '⁹ of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers; '
    10: '¹⁰ of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers. '
    11: '¹¹ Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel,
      Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, '
    12: "¹² and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites.\
      \ Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the\
      \ ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for\
      \ it. "
    13: '¹³ Because you did not carry it the first time, the Lord our God broke out
      against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the
      ark of the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles,\
      \ as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers
      as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres
      and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers Asaph
      the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son
      of Kushaiah; '
    18: '¹⁸ and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel,
      Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu,
      and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. '
    19: '¹⁹ The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals; '
    20: '²⁰ Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah
      were to play harps according to Alamoth; '
    21: '²¹ but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were
      to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith. '
    22: '²² Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for
      he understood it. '
    23: '²³ Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. '
    24: "²⁴ Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer,\
      \ the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and\
      \ Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went
      to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom
      with rejoicing. '
    26: '²⁶ And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. '
    27: '²⁷ David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites
      who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music
      of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod. '
    28: "²⁸ So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting,\
      \ to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps\
      \ and lyres. \n"
    29: ²⁹ And as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, Michal
      the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and
      celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
  16:
    1: '¹ And they brought in the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David
      had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before
      God. '
    2: '² And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings,
      he blessed the people in the name of the Lord '
    3: "³ and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread,\
      \ a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the
      Lord, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth,
      Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, who were to play harps
      and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals, '
    6: '⁶ and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before
      the ark of the covenant of God. '
    7: "⁷ Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the\
      \ Lord by Asaph and his brothers. \n"
    8: "⁸ Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name;\n    make known his deeds\
      \ among the peoples!\n"

    11: "¹¹ Seek the Lord and his strength;\n    seek his presence continually!\n"
    12: "¹² Remember the wondrous works that he has done,\n    his miracles and the\

    13: "¹³ O offspring of Israel his servant,\n    children of Jacob, his chosen\
      \ ones! \n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God;\n    his judgments are in all the earth.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Remember his covenant forever,\n    the word that he commanded, for a\

    18: "¹⁸ saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,\n    as your portion for\
      \ an inheritance.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ When you were few in number,\n    of little account, and sojourners in\
      \ it,\n"
    20: "²⁰ wandering from nation to nation,\n    from one kingdom to another people,\n"
    21: "²¹ he allowed no one to oppress them;\n    he rebuked kings on their account,\n"
    22: "²² saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,\n    do my prophets no harm!” \n"
    23: "²³ Sing to the Lord, all the earth!\n    Tell of his salvation from day to\
      \ day.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Declare his glory among the nations,\n    his marvelous works among all\
      \ the peoples!\n"
    25: "²⁵ For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,\n    and he is to be\
      \ feared above all gods.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,\n    but the Lord\
      \ made the heavens.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Splendor and majesty are before him;\n    strength and joy are in his\
      \ place. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples,\n    ascribe to the Lord\
      \ glory and strength!\n"
    29: "²⁹ Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;\n    bring an offering and\
      \ come before him!\nWorship the Lord in the splendor of holiness;\n"
    30: "³⁰     tremble before him, all the earth;\n    yes, the world is established;\
      \ it shall never be moved.\n"
    31: "³¹ Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice,\n    and let them\
      \ say among the nations, “The Lord reigns!”\n"
    32: "³² Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;\n    let the field exult, and\
      \ everything in it!\n"
    33: "³³ Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy\n    before the Lord,\
      \ for he comes to judge the earth.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;\n    for his steadfast love\

    35: "³⁵ Say also:\n“Save us, O God of our salvation,\n    and gather and deliver\

      \  and glory in your praise.\n"
    36: "³⁶ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    from everlasting to everlasting!”\n\
      Then all the people said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. \n"
    37: '³⁷ So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord to minister regularly before the ark as each day required, '
    38: '³⁸ and also Obed-edom and his sixty-eight brothers, while Obed-edom, the
      son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were to be gatekeepers. '
    39: '³⁹ And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle
      of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon '
    40: '⁴⁰ to offer burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering regularly
      morning and evening, to do all that is written in the Law of the Lord that he
      commanded Israel. '
    41: '⁴¹ With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and expressly
      named to give thanks to the Lord, for his steadfast love endures forever. '
    42: "⁴² Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments\
      \ for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate. \n"
    43: ⁴³ Then all the people departed each to his house, and David went home to
      bless his household.
  17:
    1: '¹ Now when David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold,
      I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under
      a tent.” '
    2: "² And Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with\
      \ you.” \n"
    3: '³ But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, '
    4: '⁴ “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: It is not you who will
      build me a house to dwell in. '
    5: '⁵ For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this
      day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling. '
    6: '⁶ In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with
      any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying,
      “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’ '
    7: '⁷ Now, therefore, thus shall you say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord
      of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be prince
      over my people Israel, '
    8: '⁸ and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your
      enemies from before you. And I will make for you a name, like the name of the
      great ones of the earth. '
    9: '⁹ And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that
      they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men
      shall waste them no more, as formerly, '
    10: '¹⁰ from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will
      subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the Lord will build
      you a house. '
    11: '¹¹ When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up
      your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. '
    12: '¹² He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take
      my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, '
    14: '¹⁴ but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his
      throne shall be established forever.’” '
    15: "¹⁵ In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision,\
      \ Nathan spoke to David. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and said, “Who am I, O
      Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? '
    17: "¹⁷ And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God. You have also spoken of\
      \ your servant's house for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations,\
      \ O Lord God! "
    18: '¹⁸ And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you
      know your servant. '
    19: "¹⁹ For your servant's sake, O Lord, and according to your own heart, you\
      \ have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. "
    20: '²⁰ There is none like you, O Lord, and there is no God besides you, according
      to all that we have heard with our ears. '
    21: '²¹ And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went
      to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and awesome
      things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt? '
    22: '²² And you made your people Israel to be your people forever, and you, O
      Lord, became their God. '
    23: '²³ And now, O Lord, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant
      and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken, '
    24: "²⁴ and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘The\
      \ Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God,’ and the house of your\
      \ servant David will be established before you. "
    25: '²⁵ For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house
      for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. '
    26: '²⁶ And now, O Lord, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to
      your servant. '
    27: ²⁷ Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may
      continue forever before you, for it is you, O Lord, who have blessed, and it
      is blessed forever.”
  18:
    1: "¹ After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took\
      \ Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. \n"
    2: "² And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and brought\
      \ tribute. \n"
    3: '³ David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah-Hamath, as he went to set up
      his monument at the river Euphrates. '
    4: '⁴ And David took from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot
      soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for 100
      chariots. '
    5: '⁵ And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David
      struck down 22,000 men of the Syrians. '
    6: '⁶ Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants
      to David and brought tribute. And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he
      went. '
    7: '⁷ And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of
      Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount\
      \ of bronze. With it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels\
      \ of bronze. \n"
    9: '⁹ When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of
      Hadadezer, king of Zobah, '
    10: '¹⁰ he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to ask about his health and to
      bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer
      had often been at war with Tou. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of
      silver, and of bronze. '
    11: "¹¹ These also King David dedicated to the Lord, together with the silver\
      \ and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the\
      \ Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek. \n"
    12: '¹² And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley
      of Salt. '
    13: "¹³ Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants.\
      \ And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and equity
      to all his people. '
    15: '¹⁵ And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son
      of Ahilud was recorder; '
    16: '¹⁶ and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests;
      and Shavsha was secretary; '
    17: ¹⁷ and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
      and David's sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.
  19:
    1: '¹ Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned
      in his place. '
    2: "² And David said, “I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his\
      \ father dealt kindly with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning\
      \ his father. And David's servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun\
      \ to console him. "
    3: '³ But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David
      has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants
      come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?” '
    4: "⁴ So Hanun took David's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments\
      \ in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away; "
    5: "⁵ and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers\
      \ to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain\
      \ at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and
      the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from
      Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. '
    7: '⁷ They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came
      and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities
      and came to battle. '
    8: '⁸ When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. '
    9: "⁹ And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of\
      \ the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in
      the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the
      Syrians. '
    11: '¹¹ The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they
      were arrayed against the Ammonites. '
    12: '¹² And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help
      me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. '
    13: '¹³ Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities
      of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians
      for battle, and they fled before him. '
    15: "¹⁵ And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before\
      \ Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent
      messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach
      the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. '
    17: '¹⁷ And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed
      the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David
      set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the
      men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach
      the commander of their army. '
    19: ¹⁹ And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel,
      they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not
      willing to save the Ammonites anymore.
  20:
    1: '¹ In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led
      out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and came and besieged
      Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab struck down Rabbah and overthrew
      it. '
    2: "² And David took the crown of their king from his head. He found that it weighed\
      \ a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was placed on David's\
      \ head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. "
    3: "³ And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with\
      \ saws and iron picks and axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the\
      \ Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    4: '⁴ And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai
      the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants,
      and the Philistines were subdued. '
    5: "⁵ And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair\
      \ struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear\
      \ was like a weaver's beam. "
    6: '⁶ And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature,
      who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number,
      and he also was descended from the giants. '
    7: "⁷ And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother,\
      \ struck him down. "
    8: ⁸ These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of
      David and by the hand of his servants.
  21:
    1: '¹ Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel. '
    2: '² So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel,
      from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.” '
    3: "³ But Joab said, “May the Lord add to his people a hundred times as many as\
      \ they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants?\
      \ Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for\
      \ Israel?” "
    4: "⁴ But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout\
      \ all Israel and came back to Jerusalem. "
    5: '⁵ And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel
      there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the
      sword. '
    6: "⁶ But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's\
      \ command was abhorrent to Joab. \n"
    7: '⁷ But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel. '
    8: '⁸ And David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing.
      But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very
      foolishly.” '
    9: "⁹ And the Lord spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying, "
    10: '¹⁰ “Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the Lord, Three things I offer you; choose
      one of them, that I may do it to you.’” '
    11: '¹¹ So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Choose what
      you will: '
    12: '¹² either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes
      while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword
      of the Lord, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the Lord destroying throughout
      all the territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I shall return to him who
      sent me.” '
    13: "¹³ Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let me fall into the\
      \ hand of the Lord, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into\
      \ the hand of man.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell. '
    15: '¹⁵ And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about
      to destroy it, the Lord saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said
      to the angel who was working destruction, “It is enough; now stay your hand.”
      And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. '
    16: '¹⁶ And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between
      earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem.
      Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. '
    17: "¹⁷ And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave command to number the people?\
      \ It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they\
      \ done? Please let your hand, O Lord my God, be against me and against my father's\
      \ house. But do not let the plague be on your people.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now the angel of the Lord had commanded Gad to say to David that David
      should go up and raise an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan
      the Jebusite. '
    19: "¹⁹ So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the\
      \ Lord. "
    20: '²⁰ Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four
      sons who were with him hid themselves. '
    21: '²¹ As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the
      threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground. '
    22: '²² And David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that
      I may build on it an altar to the Lord—give it to me at its full price—that
      the plague may be averted from the people.” '
    23: '²³ Then Ornan said to David, “Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems
      good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges
      for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.” '
    24: '²⁴ But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will buy them for the full price.
      I will not take for the Lord what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost
      me nothing.” '
    25: '²⁵ So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site. '
    26: '²⁶ And David built there an altar to the Lord and presented burnt offerings
      and peace offerings and called on the Lord, and the Lord answered him with fire
      from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering. '
    27: "²⁷ Then the Lord commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its\
      \ sheath. \n"
    28: '²⁸ At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him at the threshing
      floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. '
    29: '²⁹ For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness,
      and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon, '
    30: ³⁰ but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of
      the sword of the angel of the Lord.
  22:
    1: "¹ Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the Lord God and here the altar\
      \ of burnt offering for Israel.” \n"
    2: '² David commanded to gather together the resident aliens who were in the land
      of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the
      house of God. '
    3: '³ David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of
      the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing, '
    4: '⁴ and cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought
      great quantities of cedar to David. '
    5: "⁵ For David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house\
      \ that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame\
      \ and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it.”\
      \ So David provided materials in great quantity before his death. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for
      the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ David said to Solomon, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to
      the name of the Lord my God. '
    8: '⁸ But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and
      have waged great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have
      shed so much blood before me on the earth. '
    9: '⁹ Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. I will give
      him rest from all his surrounding enemies. For his name shall be Solomon, and
      I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. '
    10: "¹⁰ He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be\
      \ his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Now, my son, the Lord be with you, so that you may succeed in building
      the house of the Lord your God, as he has spoken concerning you. '
    12: '¹² Only, may the Lord grant you discretion and understanding, that when he
      gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the Lord your God. '
    13: '¹³ Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the
      rules that the Lord commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Fear
      not; do not be dismayed. '
    14: '¹⁴ With great pains I have provided for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents
      of gold, a million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for
      there is so much of it; timber and stone, too, I have provided. To these you
      must add. '
    15: '¹⁵ You have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and
      all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working '
    16: "¹⁶ gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and work! The Lord be with you!”\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son,
      saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Is not the Lord your God with you? And has he not given you peace on
      every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and
      the land is subdued before the Lord and his people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Now set your mind and heart to seek the Lord your God. Arise and build
      the sanctuary of the Lord God, so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord and
      the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the
      Lord.”
  23:
    1: "¹ When David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites. '
    3: '³ The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were numbered, and the total was
      38,000 men. '
    4: '⁴ “Twenty-four thousand of these,” David said, “shall have charge of the work
      in the house of the Lord, 6,000 shall be officers and judges, '
    5: '⁵ 4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 shall offer praises to the Lord with the instruments
      that I have made for praise.” '
    6: "⁶ And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi:\
      \ Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    7: '⁷ The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei. '
    8: '⁸ The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. '
    9: "⁹ The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the\
      \ heads of the fathers' houses of Ladan. "
    10: '¹⁰ And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four
      were the sons of Shimei. '
    11: "¹¹ Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not\
      \ have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father's house.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. '
    13: '¹³ The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to dedicate the
      most holy things, that he and his sons forever should make offerings before
      the Lord and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. '
    16: '¹⁶ The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. '
    17: '¹⁷ The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but
      the sons of Rehabiah were very many. '
    18: '¹⁸ The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. '
    19: '¹⁹ The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the
      third, and Jekameam the fourth. '
    20: "²⁰ The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second. \n"
    21: '²¹ The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. '
    22: '²² Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kinsmen, the sons
      of Kish, married them. '
    23: "²³ The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. \n"
    24: "²⁴ These were the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, the heads of fathers'\
      \ houses as they were listed according to the number of the names of the individuals\
      \ from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of\
      \ the house of the Lord. "
    25: '²⁵ For David said, “The Lord, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people,
      and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. '
    26: '²⁶ And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the
      things for its service.” '
    27: '²⁷ For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty
      years old and upward. '
    28: '²⁸ For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the
      house of the Lord, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing
      of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God. '
    29: '²⁹ Their duty was also to assist with the showbread, the flour for the grain
      offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed
      with oil, and all measures of quantity or size. '
    30: '³⁰ And they were to stand every morning, thanking and praising the Lord,
      and likewise at evening, '
    31: '³¹ and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the Lord on Sabbaths, new
      moons, and feast days, according to the number required of them, regularly before
      the Lord. '
    32: ³² Thus they were to keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary,
      and to attend the sons of Aaron, their brothers, for the service of the house
      of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ The divisions of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab,
      Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    2: '² But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar
      and Ithamar became the priests. '
    3: '³ With the help of Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons
      of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their
      service. '
    4: "⁴ Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the\
      \ sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of fathers' houses\
      \ of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar. "
    5: '⁵ They divided them by lot, all alike, for there were sacred officers and
      officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar. '
    6: "⁶ And the scribe Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in\
      \ the presence of the king and the princes and Zadok the priest and Ahimelech\
      \ the son of Abiathar and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and\
      \ of the Levites, one father's house being chosen for Eleazar and one chosen\
      \ for Ithamar. \n"
    7: '⁷ The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, '
    8: '⁸ the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, '
    9: '⁹ the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, '
    10: '¹⁰ the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, '
    11: '¹¹ the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, '
    12: '¹² the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, '
    13: '¹³ the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, '
    14: '¹⁴ the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, '
    15: '¹⁵ the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, '
    16: '¹⁶ the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, '
    17: '¹⁷ the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, '
    18: '¹⁸ the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. '
    19: "¹⁹ These had as their appointed duty in their service to come into the house\
      \ of the Lord according to the procedure established for them by Aaron their\
      \ father, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him. \n"
    20: '²⁰ And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of
      the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. '
    21: '²¹ Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. '
    22: '²² Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the
      third, Jekameam the fourth. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. '
    25: '²⁵ The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. '
    26: '²⁶ The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah: Beno. '
    27: '²⁷ The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. '
    28: '²⁸ Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. '
    29: '²⁹ Of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel. '
    30: "³⁰ The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the\
      \ Levites according to their fathers' houses. "
    31: ³¹ These also, the head of each father's house and his younger brother alike,
      cast lots, just as their brothers the sons of Aaron, in the presence of King
      David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of fathers' houses of the priests and
      of the Levites.
  25:
    1: '¹ David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service the sons
      of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who prophesied with lyres, with harps,
      and with cymbals. The list of those who did the work and of their duties was: '
    2: '² Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah, sons of
      Asaph, under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the
      king. '
    3: '³ Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah,
      and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied

    4: '⁴ Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel and Jerimoth,
      Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi,
      Hothir, Mahazioth. '
    5: "⁵ All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer, according to the promise\
      \ of God to exalt him, for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. "
    6: '⁶ They were all under the direction of their father in the music in the house
      of the Lord with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of the house of God.
      Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the order of the king. '
    7: '⁷ The number of them along with their brothers, who were trained in singing
      to the Lord, all who were skillful, was 288. '
    8: "⁸ And they cast lots for their duties, small and great, teacher and pupil\
      \ alike. \n"
    9: '⁹ The first lot fell for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah, to him and

  26:
    1: '¹ As for the divisions of the gatekeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the

    7: '⁷ The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad, whose brothers were

    9: '⁹ And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, able men, eighteen. '
    10: '¹⁰ And Hosah, of the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though

    13: "¹³ And they cast lots by fathers' houses, small and great alike, for their\

    14: '¹⁴ The lot for the east fell to Shelemiah. They cast lots also for his son
      Zechariah, a shrewd counselor, and his lot came out for the north. '
    15: "¹⁵ Obed-edom's came out for the south, and to his sons was allotted the gatehouse. "
    16: '¹⁶ For Shuppim and Hosah it came out for the west, at the gate of Shallecheth

    22: '²² for Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes
      of Israel. '
    23: '²³ David did not count those below twenty years of age, for the Lord had
      promised to make Israel as many as the stars of heaven. '
    24: "²⁴ Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count, but did not finish. Yet wrath\
      \ came upon Israel for this, and the number was not entered in the chronicles\
      \ of King David. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Over the king's treasuries was Azmaveth the son of Adiel; and over the\
      \ treasuries in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers,\
      \ was Jonathan the son of Uzziah; "
    26: '²⁶ and over those who did the work of the field for tilling the soil was
      Ezri the son of Chelub; '

    29: '²⁹ Over the herds that pastured in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite; over

    31: "³¹ All these were stewards of King David's property. \n"
    32: "³² Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, being a man of understanding\
      \ and a scribe. He and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni attended the king's sons. "
    33: "³³ Ahithophel was the king's counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's\

    34: ³⁴ Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar.
      Joab was commander of the king's army.
  28:
    1: '¹ David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the officials
      of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the commanders
      of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, the stewards of all the property and
      livestock of the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the
      mighty men and all the seasoned warriors. '
    2: '² Then King David rose to his feet and said: “Hear me, my brothers and my
      people. I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord and for the footstool of our God, and I made preparations for building. '
    3: '³ But God said to me, ‘You may not build a house for my name, for you are
      a man of war and have shed blood.’ '
    4: "⁴ Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me from all my father's house to be king\
      \ over Israel forever. For he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah\
      \ my father's house, and among my father's sons he took pleasure in me to make\
      \ me king over all Israel. "
    5: '⁵ And of all my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons) he has chosen Solomon
      my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. '
    6: '⁶ He said to me, ‘It is Solomon your son who shall build my house and my courts,
      for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. '
    7: '⁷ I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues strong in keeping my
      commandments and my rules, as he is today.’ '
    8: "⁸ Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and\
      \ in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the\
      \ Lord your God, that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance\
      \ to your children after you forever. \n"
    9: '⁹ “And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with
      a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches all hearts and
      understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you,
      but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. '
    10: "¹⁰ Be careful now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary;\
      \ be strong and do it.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David gave Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule of the temple,
      and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers,
      and of the room for the mercy seat; '
    12: '¹² and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courts of the house of
      the Lord, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God,
      and the treasuries for dedicated gifts; '
    13: '¹³ for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work
      of the service in the house of the Lord; for all the vessels for the service
      in the house of the Lord, '
    14: '¹⁴ the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight
      of silver vessels for each service, '
    15: '¹⁵ the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold
      for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its
      lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service, '
    16: '¹⁶ the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the
      silver tables, '
    17: '¹⁷ and pure gold for the forks, the basins and the cups; for the golden bowls
      and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each; '
    18: '¹⁸ for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his
      plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered
      the ark of the covenant of the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ “All this he made clear to me in writing from the hand of the Lord, all\
      \ the work to be done according to the plan.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous and do it.
      Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the Lord God, even my God, is with
      you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service
      of the house of the Lord is finished. '
    21: ²¹ And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service
      of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man
      who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people
      will be wholly at your command.”
  29:
    1: '¹ And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone
      God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace
      will not be for man but for the Lord God. '
    2: '² So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold
      for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze
      for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the
      things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony,
      colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble. '
    3: '³ Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I
      have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to
      the house of my God I give it to the house of my God: '
    4: '⁴ 3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined
      silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, '
    5: "⁵ and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold\
      \ and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating\
      \ himself today to the Lord?” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the leaders of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did\
      \ also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds,\
      \ and the officers over the king's work. "
    7: '⁷ They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics
      of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents
      of iron. '
    8: '⁸ And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of
      the Lord, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. '
    9: "⁹ Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole\
      \ heart they had offered freely to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly.
      And David said: “Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, forever
      and ever. '
    11: '¹¹ Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory
      and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours
      is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all. '
    12: '¹² Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand
      are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength
      to all. '
    13: "¹³ And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer
      willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. '
    15: '¹⁵ For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were.
      Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. '
    16: '¹⁶ O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building
      you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. '
    17: '¹⁷ I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness.
      In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now
      I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously
      to you. '
    18: '¹⁸ O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever
      such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts
      toward you. '
    19: "¹⁹ Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments,\
      \ your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may build\
      \ the palace for which I have made provision.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then David said to all the assembly, “Bless the Lord your God.” And all
      the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads
      and paid homage to the Lord and to the king. '
    21: '²¹ And they offered sacrifices to the Lord, and on the next day offered burnt
      offerings to the Lord, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their
      drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. '
    22: "²² And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great gladness.\n\
      And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed\
      \ him as prince for the Lord, and Zadok as priest. \n"
    23: '²³ Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king in place of David his
      father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. '
    24: '²⁴ All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David,
      pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. '
    25: "²⁵ And the Lord made Solomon very great in the sight of all Israel and bestowed\
      \ on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. '
    27: '²⁷ The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven
      years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. '
    28: '²⁸ Then he died at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon
      his son reigned in his place. '
    29: '²⁹ Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles
      of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the
      Chronicles of Gad the seer, '
    30: ³⁰ with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that
      came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
