Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "¹ How lonely sits the city\n    that was full of people!\nHow like a widow\
      \ has she become,\n    she who was great among the nations!\nShe who was a princess\
      \ among the provinces\n    has become a slave. \n"
    2: "² She weeps bitterly in the night,\n    with tears on her cheeks;\namong all\
      \ her lovers\n    she has none to comfort her;\nall her friends have dealt treacherously\
      \ with her;\n    they have become her enemies. \n"
    3: "³ Judah has gone into exile because of affliction\n    and hard servitude;\n\
      she dwells now among the nations,\n    but finds no resting place;\nher pursuers\
      \ have all overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress. \n"
    4: "⁴ The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for none come to the festival;\nall her gates\
      \ are desolate;\n    her priests groan;\nher virgins have been afflicted,\n\
      \    and she herself suffers bitterly. \n"
    5: "⁵ Her foes have become the head;\n    her enemies prosper,\nbecause the Lord\
      \ has afflicted her\n    for the multitude of her transgressions;\nher children\
      \ have gone away,\n    captives before the foe. \n"
    6: "⁶ From the daughter of Zion\n    all her majesty has departed.\nHer princes\
      \ have become like deer\n    that find no pasture;\nthey fled without strength\n\
      \    before the pursuer. \n"
    7: "⁷ Jerusalem remembers\n    in the days of her affliction and wandering\nall\
      \ the precious things\n    that were hers from days of old.\nWhen her people\
      \ fell into the hand of the foe,\n    and there was none to help her,\nher foes\
      \ gloated over her;\n    they mocked at her downfall. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem sinned grievously;\n    therefore she became filthy;\nall who\
      \ honored her despise her,\n    for they have seen her nakedness;\nshe herself\
      \ groans\n    and turns her face away. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her uncleanness was in her skirts;\n    she took no thought of her future;\n\
      therefore her fall is terrible;\n    she has no comforter.\n“O Lord, behold\
      \ my affliction,\n    for the enemy has triumphed!” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The enemy has stretched out his hands\n    over all her precious things;\n\
      for she has seen the nations\n    enter her sanctuary,\nthose whom you forbade\n\
      \    to enter your congregation. \n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people groan\n    as they search for bread;\nthey trade their\
      \ treasures for food\n    to revive their strength.\n“Look, O Lord, and see,\n\
      \    for I am despised.” \n"
    12: "¹² “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n    Look and see\nif there\
      \ is any sorrow like my sorrow,\n    which was brought upon me,\nwhich the Lord\
      \ inflicted\n    on the day of his fierce anger. \n"
    13: "¹³ “From on high he sent fire;\n    into my bones he made it descend;\nhe\
      \ spread a net for my feet;\n    he turned me back;\nhe has left me stunned,\n\
      \    faint all the day long. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “My transgressions were bound into a yoke;\n    by his hand they were\
      \ fastened together;\nthey were set upon my neck;\n    he caused my strength\
      \ to fail;\nthe Lord gave me into the hands\n    of those whom I cannot withstand.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “The Lord rejected\n    all my mighty men in my midst;\nhe summoned an\
      \ assembly against me\n    to crush my young men;\nthe Lord has trodden as in\
      \ a winepress\n    the virgin daughter of Judah. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “For these things I weep;\n    my eyes flow with tears;\nfor a comforter\
      \ is far from me,\n    one to revive my spirit;\nmy children are desolate,\n\
      \    for the enemy has prevailed.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion stretches out her hands,\n    but there is none to comfort her;\n\
      the Lord has commanded against Jacob\n    that his neighbors should be his foes;\n\
      Jerusalem has become\n    a filthy thing among them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The Lord is in the right,\n    for I have rebelled against his word;\n\
      but hear, all you peoples,\n    and see my suffering;\nmy young women and my\
      \ young men\n    have gone into captivity. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I called to my lovers,\n    but they deceived me;\nmy priests and elders\n\
      \    perished in the city,\nwhile they sought food\n    to revive their strength.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Look, O Lord, for I am in distress;\n    my stomach churns;\nmy heart\
      \ is wrung within me,\n    because I have been very rebellious.\nIn the street\
      \ the sword bereaves;\n    in the house it is like death. \n"
    21: "²¹ “They heard my groaning,\n    yet there is no one to comfort me.\nAll\
      \ my enemies have heard of my trouble;\n    they are glad that you have done\
      \ it.\nYou have brought the day you announced;\n    now let them be as I am.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² “Let all their evildoing come before you,\n    and deal with them\nas\
      \ you have dealt with me\n    because of all my transgressions;\nfor my groans\
      \ are many,\n    and my heart is faint.”"
  2:
    1: "¹ How the Lord in his anger\n    has set the daughter of Zion under a cloud!\n\
      He has cast down from heaven to earth\n    the splendor of Israel;\nhe has not\
      \ remembered his footstool\n    in the day of his anger. \n"
    2: "² The Lord has swallowed up without mercy\n    all the habitations of Jacob;\n\
      in his wrath he has broken down\n    the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;\n\
      he has brought down to the ground in dishonor\n    the kingdom and its rulers.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ He has cut down in fierce anger\n    all the might of Israel;\nhe has withdrawn\
      \ from them his right hand\n    in the face of the enemy;\nhe has burned like\
      \ a flaming fire in Jacob,\n    consuming all around. \n"
    4: "⁴ He has bent his bow like an enemy,\n    with his right hand set like a foe;\n\
      and he has killed all who were delightful in our eyes\n    in the tent of the\
      \ daughter of Zion;\nhe has poured out his fury like fire. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord has become like an enemy;\n    he has swallowed up Israel;\nhe\
      \ has swallowed up all its palaces;\n    he has laid in ruins its strongholds,\n\
      and he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah\n    mourning and lamentation.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ He has laid waste his booth like a garden,\n    laid in ruins his meeting\
      \ place;\nthe Lord has made Zion forget\n    festival and Sabbath,\nand in his\
      \ fierce indignation has spurned king and priest. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has scorned his altar,\n    disowned his sanctuary;\nhe has delivered\
      \ into the hand of the enemy\n    the walls of her palaces;\nthey raised a clamor\
      \ in the house of the Lord\n    as on the day of festival. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord determined to lay in ruins\n    the wall of the daughter of Zion;\n\
      he stretched out the measuring line;\n    he did not restrain his hand from\
      \ destroying;\nhe caused rampart and wall to lament;\n    they languished together.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground;\n    he has ruined and broken her bars;\n\
      her king and princes are among the nations;\n    the law is no more,\nand her\
      \ prophets find\n    no vision from the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of the daughter of Zion\n    sit on the ground in silence;\n\
      they have thrown dust on their heads\n    and put on sackcloth;\nthe young women\
      \ of Jerusalem\n    have bowed their heads to the ground. \n"
    11: "¹¹ My eyes are spent with weeping;\n    my stomach churns;\nmy bile is poured\
      \ out to the ground\n    because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,\n\
      because infants and babies faint\n    in the streets of the city. \n"
    12: "¹² They cry to their mothers,\n    “Where is bread and wine?”\nas they faint\
      \ like a wounded man\n    in the streets of the city,\nas their life is poured\
      \ out\n    on their mothers' bosom. \n"
    13: "¹³ What can I say for you, to what compare you,\n    O daughter of Jerusalem?\n\
      What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you,\n    O virgin daughter of Zion?\n\
      For your ruin is vast as the sea;\n    who can heal you? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your prophets have seen for you\n    false and deceptive visions;\nthey\
      \ have not exposed your iniquity\n    to restore your fortunes,\nbut have seen\
      \ for you oracles\n    that are false and misleading. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who pass along the way\n    clap their hands at you;\nthey hiss and\
      \ wag their heads\n    at the daughter of Jerusalem:\n“Is this the city that\
      \ was called\n    the perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of all the earth?”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All your enemies\n    rail against you;\nthey hiss, they gnash their teeth,\n\
      \    they cry: “We have swallowed her!\nAh, this is the day we longed for;\n\
      \    now we have it; we see it!” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord has done what he purposed;\n    he has carried out his word,\n\
      which he commanded long ago;\n    he has thrown down without pity;\nhe has made\
      \ the enemy rejoice over you\n    and exalted the might of your foes. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their heart cried to the Lord.\n    O wall of the daughter of Zion,\n\
      let tears stream down like a torrent\n    day and night!\nGive yourself no rest,\n\
      \    your eyes no respite! \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Arise, cry out in the night,\n    at the beginning of the night watches!\n\
      Pour out your heart like water\n    before the presence of the Lord!\nLift your\
      \ hands to him\n    for the lives of your children,\nwho faint for hunger\n\
      \    at the head of every street.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Look, O Lord, and see!\n    With whom have you dealt thus?\nShould women\
      \ eat the fruit of their womb,\n    the children of their tender care?\nShould\
      \ priest and prophet be killed\n    in the sanctuary of the Lord? \n"
    21: "²¹ In the dust of the streets\n    lie the young and the old;\nmy young women\
      \ and my young men\n    have fallen by the sword;\nyou have killed them in the\
      \ day of your anger,\n    slaughtering without pity. \n"
    22: "²² You summoned as if to a festival day\n    my terrors on every side,\n\
      and on the day of the anger of the Lord\n    no one escaped or survived;\nthose\
      \ whom I held and raised\n    my enemy destroyed."
  3:
    1: "¹ I am the man who has seen affliction\n    under the rod of his wrath;\n"
    2: "² he has driven and brought me\n    into darkness without any light;\n"
    3: "³ surely against me he turns his hand\n    again and again the whole day long.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ He has made my flesh and my skin waste away;\n    he has broken my bones;\n"
    5: "⁵ he has besieged and enveloped me\n    with bitterness and tribulation;\n"
    6: "⁶ he has made me dwell in darkness\n    like the dead of long ago. \n"
    7: "⁷ He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;\n    he has made my chains\
      \ heavy;\n"
    8: "⁸ though I call and cry for help,\n    he shuts out my prayer;\n"
    9: "⁹ he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones;\n    he has made my paths\
      \ crooked. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He is a bear lying in wait for me,\n    a lion in hiding;\n"
    11: "¹¹ he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces;\n    he has made me desolate;\n"
    12: "¹² he bent his bow and set me\n    as a target for his arrow. \n"
    13: "¹³ He drove into my kidneys\n    the arrows of his quiver;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have become the laughingstock of all peoples,\n    the object of their\
      \ taunts all day long.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He has filled me with bitterness;\n    he has sated me with wormwood.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He has made my teeth grind on gravel,\n    and made me cower in ashes;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ my soul is bereft of peace;\n    I have forgotten what happiness is;\n"
    18: "¹⁸ so I say, “My endurance has perished;\n    so has my hope from the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Remember my affliction and my wanderings,\n    the wormwood and the gall!\n"
    20: "²⁰ My soul continually remembers it\n    and is bowed down within me.\n"
    21: "²¹ But this I call to mind,\n    and therefore I have hope: \n"
    22: "²² The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;\n    his mercies never come\
      \ to an end;\n"
    23: "²³ they are new every morning;\n    great is your faithfulness.\n"
    24: "²⁴ “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,\n    “therefore I will hope in\
      \ him.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord is good to those who wait for him,\n    to the soul who seeks\
      \ him.\n"
    26: "²⁶ It is good that one should wait quietly\n    for the salvation of the\
      \ Lord.\n"
    27: "²⁷ It is good for a man that he bear\n    the yoke in his youth. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Let him sit alone in silence\n    when it is laid on him;\n"
    29: "²⁹ let him put his mouth in the dust—\n    there may yet be hope;\n"
    30: "³⁰ let him give his cheek to the one who strikes,\n    and let him be filled\
      \ with insults. \n"
    31: "³¹ For the Lord will not\n    cast off forever,\n"
    32: "³² but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion\n    according to\
      \ the abundance of his steadfast love;\n"
    33: "³³ for he does not afflict from his heart\n    or grieve the children of\
      \ men. \n"
    34: "³⁴ To crush underfoot\n    all the prisoners of the earth,\n"
    35: "³⁵ to deny a man justice\n    in the presence of the Most High,\n"
    36: "³⁶ to subvert a man in his lawsuit,\n    the Lord does not approve. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Who has spoken and it came to pass,\n    unless the Lord has commanded\
      \ it?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Is it not from the mouth of the Most High\n    that good and bad come?\n"
    39: "³⁹ Why should a living man complain,\n    a man, about the punishment of\
      \ his sins? \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Let us test and examine our ways,\n    and return to the Lord!\n"

    2: "² The precious sons of Zion,\n    worth their weight in fine gold,\nhow they\
      \ are regarded as earthen pots,\n    the work of a potter's hands! \n"
    3: "³ Even jackals offer the breast;\n    they nurse their young;\nbut the daughter\

      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ The tongue of the nursing infant sticks\n    to the roof of its mouth for\
      \ thirst;\nthe children beg for food,\n    but no one gives to them. \n"
    5: "⁵ Those who once feasted on delicacies\n    perish in the streets;\nthose\
      \ who were brought up in purple\n    embrace ash heaps. \n"
    6: "⁶ For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater\n   \
      \ than the punishment of Sodom,\nwhich was overthrown in a moment,\n    and\
      \ no hands were wrung for her. \n"
    7: "⁷ Her princes were purer than snow,\n    whiter than milk;\ntheir bodies were\
      \ more ruddy than coral,\n    the beauty of their form was like sapphire. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now their face is blacker than soot;\n    they are not recognized in the\

    15: "¹⁵ “Away! Unclean!” people cried at them.\n    “Away! Away! Do not touch!”\n\
