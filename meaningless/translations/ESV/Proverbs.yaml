    16: "¹⁶ for their feet run to evil,\n    and they make haste to shed blood.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For in vain is a net spread\n    in the sight of any bird,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ but these men lie in wait for their own blood;\n    they set an ambush\
      \ for their own lives.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain;\n    it takes\
      \ away the life of its possessors. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Wisdom cries aloud in the street,\n    in the markets she raises her voice;\n"
    21: "²¹ at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;\n    at the entrance of\

      \ my hand and no one has heeded,\n"
    25: "²⁵ because you have ignored all my counsel\n    and would have none of my\
      \ reproof,\n"
    26: "²⁶ I also will laugh at your calamity;\n    I will mock when terror strikes\
      \ you,\n"
    27: "²⁷ when terror strikes you like a storm\n    and your calamity comes like\
      \ a whirlwind,\n    when distress and anguish come upon you.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;\n    they will seek\
      \ me diligently but will not find me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because they hated knowledge\n    and did not choose the fear of the Lord,\n"
    30: "³⁰ would have none of my counsel\n    and despised all my reproof,\n"
    31: "³¹ therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way,\n    and have their fill\

      \ embrace her.\n"
    9: "⁹ She will place on your head a graceful garland;\n    she will bestow on\
      \ you a beautiful crown.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear, my son, and accept my words,\n    that the years of your life may\
      \ be many.\n"

      \ the evil.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Avoid it; do not go on it;\n    turn away from it and pass on.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;\n    they are robbed\

  5:
    1: "¹ My son, be attentive to my wisdom;\n    incline your ear to my understanding,\n"
    2: "² that you may keep discretion,\n    and your lips may guard knowledge.\n"
    3: "³ For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey,\n    and her speech is smoother\
      \ than oil,\n"
    4: "⁴ but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,\n    sharp as a two-edged sword.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her feet go down to death;\n    her steps follow the path to Sheol;\n"
    6: "⁶ she does not ponder the path of life;\n    her ways wander, and she does\
      \ not know it. \n"
    7: "⁷ And now, O sons, listen to me,\n    and do not depart from the words of\
      \ my mouth.\n"
    8: "⁸ Keep your way far from her,\n    and do not go near the door of her house,\n"

      \ go to the house of a foreigner,\n"
    11: "¹¹ and at the end of your life you groan,\n    when your flesh and body are\
      \ consumed,\n"
    12: "¹² and you say, “How I hated discipline,\n    and my heart despised reproof!\n"
    13: "¹³ I did not listen to the voice of my teachers\n    or incline my ear to\
      \ my instructors.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I am at the brink of utter ruin\n    in the assembled congregation.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Drink water from your own cistern,\n    flowing water from your own well.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Should your springs be scattered abroad,\n    streams of water in the\
      \ streets?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let them be for yourself alone,\n    and not for strangers with you.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let your fountain be blessed,\n    and rejoice in the wife of your youth,\n"
    19: "¹⁹     a lovely deer, a graceful doe.\nLet her breasts fill you at all times\
      \ with delight;\n    be intoxicated always in her love.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman\n    and\
      \ embrace the bosom of an adulteress?\n"
    21: "²¹ For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord,\n    and he ponders\
      \ all his paths.\n"
    22: "²² The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him,\n    and he is held fast in\
      \ the cords of his sin.\n"
    23: "²³ He dies for lack of discipline,\n    and because of his great folly he\
      \ is led astray."
  6:
    1: "¹ My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,\n    have given your\
      \ pledge for a stranger,\n"
    2: "² if you are snared in the words of your mouth,\n    caught in the words of\
      \ your mouth,\n"
    3: "³ then do this, my son, and save yourself,\n    for you have come into the\
      \ hand of your neighbor:\n    go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.\n"
    4: "⁴ Give your eyes no sleep\n    and your eyelids no slumber;\n"
    5: "⁵ save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,\n    like a bird\
      \ from the hand of the fowler. \n"
    6: "⁶ Go to the ant, O sluggard;\n    consider her ways, and be wise.\n"
    7: "⁷ Without having any chief,\n    officer, or ruler,\n"
    8: "⁸ she prepares her bread in summer\n    and gathers her food in harvest.\n"
    9: "⁹ How long will you lie there, O sluggard?\n    When will you arise from your\
      \ sleep?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A little sleep, a little slumber,\n    a little folding of the hands to\
      \ rest,\n"
    11: "¹¹ and poverty will come upon you like a robber,\n    and want like an armed\
      \ man. \n"
    12: "¹² A worthless person, a wicked man,\n    goes about with crooked speech,\n"
    13: "¹³ winks with his eyes, signals with his feet,\n    points with his finger,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ with perverted heart devises evil,\n    continually sowing discord;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;\n    in a moment he will\
      \ be broken beyond healing. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ There are six things that the Lord hates,\n    seven that are an abomination\
      \ to him:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ haughty eyes, a lying tongue,\n    and hands that shed innocent blood,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ a heart that devises wicked plans,\n    feet that make haste to run to\
      \ evil,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ a false witness who breathes out lies,\n    and one who sows discord among\
      \ brothers. \n"
    20: "²⁰ My son, keep your father's commandment,\n    and forsake not your mother's\
      \ teaching.\n"
    21: "²¹ Bind them on your heart always;\n    tie them around your neck.\n"
    22: "²² When you walk, they will lead you;\n    when you lie down, they will watch\
      \ over you;\n    and when you awake, they will talk with you.\n"
    23: "²³ For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,\n    and the reproofs\
      \ of discipline are the way of life,\n"
    24: "²⁴ to preserve you from the evil woman,\n    from the smooth tongue of the\
      \ adulteress.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not desire her beauty in your heart,\n    and do not let her capture\
      \ you with her eyelashes;\n"
    26: "²⁶ for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread,\n    but a married\
      \ woman hunts down a precious life.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Can a man carry fire next to his chest\n    and his clothes not be burned?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Or can one walk on hot coals\n    and his feet not be scorched?\n"
    29: "²⁹ So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife;\n    none who touches her\
      \ will go unpunished.\n"
    30: "³⁰ People do not despise a thief if he steals\n    to satisfy his appetite\
      \ when he is hungry,\n"
    31: "³¹ but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold;\n    he will give all the\
      \ goods of his house.\n"
    32: "³² He who commits adultery lacks sense;\n    he who does it destroys himself.\n"
    33: "³³ He will get wounds and dishonor,\n    and his disgrace will not be wiped\
      \ away.\n"
    34: "³⁴ For jealousy makes a man furious,\n    and he will not spare when he takes\
      \ revenge.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He will accept no compensation;\n    he will refuse though you multiply\
      \ gifts."
  7:

      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And behold, the woman meets him,\n    dressed as a prostitute, wily of\
      \ heart.\n"
    11: "¹¹ She is loud and wayward;\n    her feet do not stay at home;\n"
    12: "¹² now in the street, now in the market,\n    and at every corner she lies\
      \ in wait.\n"
    13: "¹³ She seizes him and kisses him,\n    and with bold face she says to him,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I had to offer sacrifices,\n    and today I have paid my vows;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ so now I have come out to meet you,\n    to seek you eagerly, and I have\
      \ found you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I have spread my couch with coverings,\n    colored linens from Egyptian\
      \ linen;\n"

    18: "¹⁸ Come, let us take our fill of love till morning;\n    let us delight ourselves\
      \ with love.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For my husband is not at home;\n    he has gone on a long journey;\n"
    20: "²⁰ he took a bag of money with him;\n    at full moon he will come home.”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ With much seductive speech she persuades him;\n    with her smooth talk\
      \ she compels him.\n"
    22: "²² All at once he follows her,\n    as an ox goes to the slaughter,\nor as\
      \ a stag is caught fast\n"
