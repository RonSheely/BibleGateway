Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham,\
      \ Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, you peoples, all of you;\n    pay attention, O earth, and all that\
      \ is in it,\nand let the Lord God be a witness against you,\n    the Lord from\
      \ his holy temple.\n"
    3: "³ For behold, the Lord is coming out of his place,\n    and will come down\
      \ and tread upon the high places of the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ And the mountains will melt under him,\n    and the valleys will split open,\n\
      like wax before the fire,\n    like waters poured down a steep place.\n"
    5: "⁵ All this is for the transgression of Jacob\n    and for the sins of the\
      \ house of Israel.\nWhat is the transgression of Jacob?\n    Is it not Samaria?\n\
      And what is the high place of Judah?\n    Is it not Jerusalem?\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country,\n    a place for\
      \ planting vineyards,\nand I will pour down her stones into the valley\n   \
      \ and uncover her foundations.\n"
    7: "⁷ All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,\n    all her wages shall\
      \ be burned with fire,\n    and all her idols I will lay waste,\nfor from the\
      \ fee of a prostitute she gathered them,\n    and to the fee of a prostitute\
      \ they shall return. \n"
    8: "⁸ For this I will lament and wail;\n    I will go stripped and naked;\nI will\
      \ make lamentation like the jackals,\n    and mourning like the ostriches.\n"
    9: "⁹ For her wound is incurable,\n    and it has come to Judah;\nit has reached\
      \ to the gate of my people,\n    to Jerusalem. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell it not in Gath;\n    weep not at all;\nin Beth-le-aphrah\n    roll\
      \ yourselves in the dust.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Pass on your way,\n    inhabitants of Shaphir,\n    in nakedness and shame;\n\
      the inhabitants of Zaanan\n    do not come out;\nthe lamentation of Beth-ezel\n\
      \    shall take away from you its standing place.\n"
    12: "¹² For the inhabitants of Maroth\n    wait anxiously for good,\nbecause disaster\
      \ has come down from the Lord\n    to the gate of Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ Harness the steeds to the chariots,\n    inhabitants of Lachish;\nit was\
      \ the beginning of sin\n    to the daughter of Zion,\nfor in you were found\n\
      \    the transgressions of Israel.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore you shall give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth-gath;\nthe houses\
      \ of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing\n    to the kings of Israel.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will again bring a conqueror to you,\n    inhabitants of Mareshah;\n\
      the glory of Israel\n    shall come to Adullam.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair,\n    for the children of your\
      \ delight;\nmake yourselves as bald as the eagle,\n    for they shall go from\
      \ you into exile."
  2:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who devise wickedness\n    and work evil on their beds!\nWhen\
      \ the morning dawns, they perform it,\n    because it is in the power of their\
      \ hand.\n"
    2: "² They covet fields and seize them,\n    and houses, and take them away;\n\
      they oppress a man and his house,\n    a man and his inheritance.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore thus says the Lord:\nbehold, against this family I am devising\
      \ disaster,\n    from which you cannot remove your necks,\nand you shall not\
      \ walk haughtily,\n    for it will be a time of disaster.\n"
    4: "⁴ In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you\n    and moan bitterly,\n\
      and say, “We are utterly ruined;\n    he changes the portion of my people;\n\
      how he removes it from me!\n    To an apostate he allots our fields.”\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot\n    in the assembly\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Do not preach”—thus they preach—\n    “one should not preach of such things;\n\
      \    disgrace will not overtake us.”\n"
    7: "⁷ Should this be said, O house of Jacob?\n    Has the Lord grown impatient?\n\
      \    Are these his deeds?\nDo not my words do good\n    to him who walks uprightly?\n"
    8: "⁸ But lately my people have risen up as an enemy;\nyou strip the rich robe\
      \ from those who pass by trustingly\n    with no thought of war.\n"
    9: "⁹ The women of my people you drive out\n    from their delightful houses;\n\
      from their young children you take away\n    my splendor forever.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Arise and go,\n    for this is no place to rest,\nbecause of uncleanness\
      \ that destroys\n    with a grievous destruction.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If a man should go about and utter wind and lies,\n    saying, “I will\
      \ preach to you of wine and strong drink,”\n    he would be the preacher for\
      \ this people!\n"
    12: "¹² I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob;\n    I will gather the remnant\
      \ of Israel;\nI will set them together\n    like sheep in a fold,\nlike a flock\
      \ in its pasture,\n    a noisy multitude of men.\n"
    13: "¹³ He who opens the breach goes up before them;\n    they break through and\
      \ pass the gate,\n    going out by it.\nTheir king passes on before them,\n\
      \    the Lord at their head."
  3:
    1: "¹ And I said:\nHear, you heads of Jacob\n    and rulers of the house of Israel!\n\
      Is it not for you to know justice?—\n"
    2: "²     you who hate the good and love the evil,\nwho tear the skin from off\
      \ my people\n    and their flesh from off their bones,\n"
    3: "³ who eat the flesh of my people,\n    and flay their skin from off them,\n\
      and break their bones in pieces\n    and chop them up like meat in a pot,\n\
      \    like flesh in a cauldron. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then they will cry to the Lord,\n    but he will not answer them;\nhe will\
      \ hide his face from them at that time,\n    because they have made their deeds\
      \ evil. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets\n    who lead my people astray,\n\
      who cry “Peace”\n    when they have something to eat,\nbut declare war against\
      \ him\n    who puts nothing into their mouths.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision,\n    and darkness to\
      \ you, without divination.\nThe sun shall go down on the prophets,\n    and\
      \ the day shall be black over them;\n"
    7: "⁷ the seers shall be disgraced,\n    and the diviners put to shame;\nthey\
      \ shall all cover their lips,\n    for there is no answer from God.\n"
    8: "⁸ But as for me, I am filled with power,\n    with the Spirit of the Lord,\n\
      \    and with justice and might,\nto declare to Jacob his transgression\n  \
      \  and to Israel his sin. \n"
    9: "⁹ Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob\n    and rulers of the house\
      \ of Israel,\nwho detest justice\n    and make crooked all that is straight,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ who build Zion with blood\n    and Jerusalem with iniquity.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Its heads give judgment for a bribe;\n    its priests teach for a price;\n\
      \    its prophets practice divination for money;\nyet they lean on the Lord\
      \ and say,\n    “Is not the Lord in the midst of us?\n    No disaster shall\
      \ come upon us.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore because of you\n    Zion shall be plowed as a field;\nJerusalem\
      \ shall become a heap of ruins,\n    and the mountain of the house a wooded\
      \ height."
  4:
    1: "¹ It shall come to pass in the latter days\n    that the mountain of the house\
      \ of the Lord\nshall be established as the highest of the mountains,\n    and\
      \ it shall be lifted up above the hills;\nand peoples shall flow to it,\n"
    2: "²     and many nations shall come, and say:\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\n    to the house of the God of Jacob,\nthat he may teach us\
      \ his ways\n    and that we may walk in his paths.”\nFor out of Zion shall go\
      \ forth the law,\n    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    3: "³ He shall judge between many peoples,\n    and shall decide disputes for\
      \ strong nations far away;\nand they shall beat their swords into plowshares,\n\
      \    and their spears into pruning hooks;\nnation shall not lift up sword against\
      \ nation,\n    neither shall they learn war anymore;\n"
    4: "⁴ but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree,\n  \
      \  and no one shall make them afraid,\n    for the mouth of the Lord of hosts\
      \ has spoken.\n"
    5: "⁵ For all the peoples walk\n    each in the name of its god,\nbut we will\
      \ walk in the name of the Lord our God\n    forever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ In that day, declares the Lord,\n    I will assemble the lame\nand gather\
      \ those who have been driven away\n    and those whom I have afflicted;\n"
    7: "⁷ and the lame I will make the remnant,\n    and those who were cast off,\
      \ a strong nation;\nand the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion\n    from\
      \ this time forth and forevermore. \n"
    8: "⁸ And you, O tower of the flock,\n    hill of the daughter of Zion,\nto you\
      \ shall it come,\n    the former dominion shall come,\n    kingship for the\
      \ daughter of Jerusalem. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now why do you cry aloud?\n    Is there no king in you?\nHas your counselor\
      \ perished,\n    that pain seized you like a woman in labor?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,\n    like a woman in labor,\nfor\
      \ now you shall go out from the city\n    and dwell in the open country;\n \
      \   you shall go to Babylon.\nThere you shall be rescued;\n    there the Lord\
      \ will redeem you\n    from the hand of your enemies. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now many nations\n    are assembled against you,\nsaying, “Let her be\
      \ defiled,\n    and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”\n"
    12: "¹² But they do not know\n    the thoughts of the Lord;\nthey do not understand\
      \ his plan,\n    that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.\n"
    13: "¹³ Arise and thresh,\n    O daughter of Zion,\nfor I will make your horn\
      \ iron,\n    and I will make your hoofs bronze;\nyou shall beat in pieces many\
      \ peoples;\n    and shall devote their gain to the Lord,\n    their wealth to\
      \ the Lord of the whole earth."
  5:
    1: "¹ Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops;\n    siege is laid against\
      \ us;\nwith a rod they strike the judge of Israel\n    on the cheek.\n"
    2: "²  But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,\n    who are too little to be among the\
      \ clans of Judah,\nfrom you shall come forth for me\n    one who is to be ruler\
      \ in Israel,\nwhose coming forth is from of old,\n    from ancient days.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore he shall give them up until the time\n    when she who is in labor\
      \ has given birth;\nthen the rest of his brothers shall return\n    to the people\
      \ of Israel.\n"
    4: "⁴ And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord,\n\
      \    in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God.\nAnd they shall dwell secure,\
      \ for now he shall be great\n    to the ends of the earth.\n"
    5: "⁵ And he shall be their peace.\nWhen the Assyrian comes into our land\n  \
      \  and treads in our palaces,\nthen we will raise against him seven shepherds\n\
      \    and eight princes of men;\n"
    6: "⁶ they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,\n    and the land\
      \ of Nimrod at its entrances;\nand he shall deliver us from the Assyrian\n \
      \   when he comes into our land\n    and treads within our border. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then the remnant of Jacob shall be\n    in the midst of many peoples\nlike\
      \ dew from the Lord,\n    like showers on the grass,\nwhich delay not for a\
      \ man\n    nor wait for the children of man.\n"
    8: "⁸ And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations,\n    in the midst of\
      \ many peoples,\nlike a lion among the beasts of the forest,\n    like a young\
      \ lion among the flocks of sheep,\nwhich, when it goes through, treads down\n\
      \    and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver.\n"
    9: "⁹ Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries,\n    and all your enemies\
      \ shall be cut off. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And in that day, declares the Lord,\n    I will cut off your horses from\
      \ among you\n    and will destroy your chariots;\n"
    11: "¹¹ and I will cut off the cities of your land\n    and throw down all your\
      \ strongholds;\n"
    12: "¹² and I will cut off sorceries from your hand,\n    and you shall have no\
      \ more tellers of fortunes;\n"
    13: "¹³ and I will cut off your carved images\n    and your pillars from among\
      \ you,\nand you shall bow down no more\n    to the work of your hands;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ and I will root out your Asherah images from among you\n    and destroy\
      \ your cities.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance\n    on the nations that\
      \ did not obey."
  6:
    1: "¹ Hear what the Lord says:\nArise, plead your case before the mountains,\n\
      \    and let the hills hear your voice.\n"
    2: "² Hear, you mountains, the indictment of the Lord,\n    and you enduring foundations\
      \ of the earth,\nfor the Lord has an indictment against his people,\n    and\
      \ he will contend with Israel. \n"
    3: "³ “O my people, what have I done to you?\n    How have I wearied you? Answer\
      \ me!\n"
    4: "⁴ For I brought you up from the land of Egypt\n    and redeemed you from the\
      \ house of slavery,\nand I sent before you Moses,\n    Aaron, and Miriam.\n"
    5: "⁵ O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,\n    and what Balaam\
      \ the son of Beor answered him,\nand what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\n\
      \    that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.” \n"
    6: "⁶ “With what shall I come before the Lord,\n    and bow myself before God\
      \ on high?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\n    with calves a\
      \ year old?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,\n    with ten thousands\
      \ of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\n    the\
      \ fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”\n"
    8: "⁸ He has told you, O man, what is good;\n    and what does the Lord require\
      \ of you\nbut to do justice, and to love kindness,\n    and to walk humbly with\
      \ your God? \n"
    9: "⁹ The voice of the Lord cries to the city—\n    and it is sound wisdom to\
      \ fear your name:\n“Hear of the rod and of him who appointed it!\n"
    10: "¹⁰     Can I forget any longer the treasures of wickedness in the house of\
      \ the wicked,\n    and the scant measure that is accursed?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales\n    and with a bag of deceitful\
      \ weights?\n"
    12: "¹² Your rich men are full of violence;\n    your inhabitants speak lies,\n\
      \    and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow,\n    making you desolate\
      \ because of your sins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall eat, but not be satisfied,\n    and there shall be hunger within\
      \ you;\nyou shall put away, but not preserve,\n    and what you preserve I will\
      \ give to the sword.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You shall sow, but not reap;\n    you shall tread olives, but not anoint\
      \ yourselves with oil;\n    you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For you have kept the statutes of Omri,\n    and all the works of the\
      \ house of Ahab;\n    and you have walked in their counsels,\nthat I may make\
      \ you a desolation, and your inhabitants a hissing;\n    so you shall bear the\
      \ scorn of my people.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ Woe is me! For I have become\n    as when the summer fruit has been gathered,\n\
      \    as when the grapes have been gleaned:\nthere is no cluster to eat,\n  \
      \  no first-ripe fig that my soul desires.\n"
    2: "² The godly has perished from the earth,\n    and there is no one upright\
      \ among mankind;\nthey all lie in wait for blood,\n    and each hunts the other\
      \ with a net.\n"
    3: "³ Their hands are on what is evil, to do it well;\n    the prince and the\
      \ judge ask for a bribe,\nand the great man utters the evil desire of his soul;\n\
      \    thus they weave it together.\n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is like a brier,\n    the most upright of them a thorn\
      \ hedge.\nThe day of your watchmen, of your punishment, has come;\n    now their\
      \ confusion is at hand.\n"
    5: "⁵ Put no trust in a neighbor;\n    have no confidence in a friend;\nguard\
      \ the doors of your mouth\n    from her who lies in your arms;\n"
    6: "⁶ for the son treats the father with contempt,\n    the daughter rises up\
      \ against her mother,\nthe daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;\n    a\
      \ man's enemies are the men of his own house.\n"
    7: "⁷ But as for me, I will look to the Lord;\n    I will wait for the God of\
      \ my salvation;\n    my God will hear me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Rejoice not over me, O my enemy;\n    when I fall, I shall rise;\nwhen I\
      \ sit in darkness,\n    the Lord will be a light to me.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bear the indignation of the Lord\n    because I have sinned against\
      \ him,\nuntil he pleads my cause\n    and executes judgment for me.\nHe will\
      \ bring me out to the light;\n    I shall look upon his vindication.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then my enemy will see,\n    and shame will cover her who said to me,\n\
      \    “Where is the Lord your God?”\nMy eyes will look upon her;\n    now she\
      \ will be trampled down\n    like the mire of the streets. \n"
    11: "¹¹ A day for the building of your walls!\n    In that day the boundary shall\
      \ be far extended.\n"
    12: "¹² In that day they will come to you,\n    from Assyria and the cities of\
      \ Egypt,\nand from Egypt to the River,\n    from sea to sea and from mountain\
      \ to mountain.\n"
    13: "¹³ But the earth will be desolate\n    because of its inhabitants,\n    for\
      \ the fruit of their deeds. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shepherd your people with your staff,\n    the flock of your inheritance,\n\
      who dwell alone in a forest\n    in the midst of a garden land;\nlet them graze\
      \ in Bashan and Gilead\n    as in the days of old.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,\n    I will show\
      \ them marvelous things.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might;\nthey shall lay\
      \ their hands on their mouths;\n    their ears shall be deaf;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ they shall lick the dust like a serpent,\n    like the crawling things\
      \ of the earth;\nthey shall come trembling out of their strongholds;\n    they\
      \ shall turn in dread to the Lord our God,\n    and they shall be in fear of\
      \ you. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity\n    and passing over transgression\n\
      \    for the remnant of his inheritance?\nHe does not retain his anger forever,\n\
      \    because he delights in steadfast love.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will again have compassion on us;\n    he will tread our iniquities\
      \ underfoot.\nYou will cast all our sins\n    into the depths of the sea.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You will show faithfulness to Jacob\n    and steadfast love to Abraham,\n\
      as you have sworn to our fathers\n    from the days of old."
