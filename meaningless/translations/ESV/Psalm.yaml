  1:
    1: "¹ Blessed is the man\n    who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,\nnor\
      \ stands in the way of sinners,\n    nor sits in the seat of scoffers;\n"
    2: "² but his delight is in the law of the Lord,\n    and on his law he meditates\
      \ day and night. \n"
    3: "³ He is like a tree\n    planted by streams of water\nthat yields its fruit\
      \ in its season,\n    and its leaf does not wither.\nIn all that he does, he\
      \ prospers.\n"
    4: "⁴ The wicked are not so,\n    but are like chaff that the wind drives away.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\n    nor sinners in\
      \ the congregation of the righteous;\n"
    6: "⁶ for the Lord knows the way of the righteous,\n    but the way of the wicked\
      \ will perish."
  2:
    1: "¹ Why do the nations rage\n    and the peoples plot in vain?\n"

    3: "³ “Let us burst their bonds apart\n    and cast away their cords from us.”\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ He who sits in the heavens laughs;\n    the Lord holds them in derision.\n"
    5: "⁵ Then he will speak to them in his wrath,\n    and terrify them in his fury,\
      \ saying,\n"
    6: "⁶ “As for me, I have set my King\n    on Zion, my holy hill.” \n"
    7: "⁷ I will tell of the decree:\nThe Lord said to me, “You are my Son;\n    today\
      \ I have begotten you.\n"
    8: "⁸ Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,\n    and the ends\
      \ of the earth your possession.\n"
    9: "⁹ You shall break them with a rod of iron\n    and dash them in pieces like\
      \ a potter's vessel.” \n"

      \ relief when I was in distress.\n    Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!\
      \ \n"
    2: "² O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?\n    How long will\
      \ you love vain words and seek after lies? \n"
    3: "³ But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself;\n    the Lord\
      \ hears when I call to him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Be angry, and do not sin;\n    ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and\
      \ be silent. \n"

    3: "³ O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice;\n    in the morning I prepare\
      \ a sacrifice for you and watch. \n"
    4: "⁴ For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;\n    evil may not dwell\
      \ with you.\n"
    5: "⁵ The boastful shall not stand before your eyes;\n    you hate all evildoers.\n"

      \ and deceitful man. \n"
    7: "⁷ But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love,\n    will enter your\
      \ house.\nI will bow down toward your holy temple\n    in the fear of you.\n"
    8: "⁸ Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness\n    because of my enemies;\n   \
      \ make your way straight before me. \n"
    9: "⁹ For there is no truth in their mouth;\n    their inmost self is destruction;\n\
      their throat is an open grave;\n    they flatter with their tongue.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Make them bear their guilt, O God;\n    let them fall by their own counsels;\n\
