      the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries\n    and keeps wrath for his enemies.\n"
    3: "³ The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,\n    and the Lord will by\
      \ no means clear the guilty.\nHis way is in whirlwind and storm,\n    and the\
      \ clouds are the dust of his feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ He rebukes the sea and makes it dry;\n    he dries up all the rivers;\n\
      Bashan and Carmel wither;\n    the bloom of Lebanon withers.\n"
    5: "⁵ The mountains quake before him;\n    the hills melt;\nthe earth heaves before\
      \ him,\n    the world and all who dwell in it. \n"
    6: "⁶ Who can stand before his indignation?\n    Who can endure the heat of his\
      \ anger?\nHis wrath is poured out like fire,\n    and the rocks are broken into\
      \ pieces by him.\n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord is good,\n    a stronghold in the day of trouble;\nhe knows those\
      \ who take refuge in him.\n"
    8: "⁸     But with an overflowing flood\nhe will make a complete end of the adversaries,\n\
      \    and will pursue his enemies into darkness.\n"
    9: "⁹ What do you plot against the Lord?\n    He will make a complete end;\n \
      \   trouble will not rise up a second time.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For they are like entangled thorns,\n    like drunkards as they drink;\n\
      \    they are consumed like stubble fully dried.\n"
    11: "¹¹ From you came one\n    who plotted evil against the Lord,\n    a worthless\
      \ counselor. \n"
    12: "¹² Thus says the Lord,\n“Though they are at full strength and many,\n   \
      \ they will be cut down and pass away.\nThough I have afflicted you,\n    I\
      \ will afflict you no more.\n"
    13: "¹³ And now I will break his yoke from off you\n    and will burst your bonds\
      \ apart.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord has given commandment about you:\n    “No more shall your name\
      \ be perpetuated;\nfrom the house of your gods I will cut off\n    the carved\
      \ image and the metal image.\nI will make your grave, for you are vile.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵  Behold, upon the mountains, the feet of him\n    who brings good news,\n\
      \    who publishes peace!\nKeep your feasts, O Judah;\n    fulfill your vows,\n\
      for never again shall the worthless pass through you;\n    he is utterly cut\
      \ off."
  2:
    1: "¹ The scatterer has come up against you.\n    Man the ramparts;\n    watch\
      \ the road;\ndress for battle;\n    collect all your strength. \n"
    2: "² For the Lord is restoring the majesty of Jacob\n    as the majesty of Israel,\n\
      for plunderers have plundered them\n    and ruined their branches. \n"
    3: "³ The shield of his mighty men is red;\n    his soldiers are clothed in scarlet.\n\
      The chariots come with flashing metal\n    on the day he musters them;\n   \
      \ the cypress spears are brandished.\n"
    4: "⁴ The chariots race madly through the streets;\n    they rush to and fro through\
      \ the squares;\nthey gleam like torches;\n    they dart like lightning.\n"
    5: "⁵ He remembers his officers;\n    they stumble as they go,\nthey hasten to\
      \ the wall;\n    the siege tower is set up.\n"
    6: "⁶ The river gates are opened;\n    the palace melts away;\n"
    7: "⁷ its mistress is stripped; she is carried off,\n    her slave girls lamenting,\n\
      moaning like doves\n    and beating their breasts.\n"
    8: "⁸ Nineveh is like a pool\n    whose waters run away.\n“Halt! Halt!” they cry,\n\
      \    but none turns back.\n"
    9: "⁹ Plunder the silver,\n    plunder the gold!\nThere is no end of the treasure\n\
      \    or of the wealth of all precious things. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Desolate! Desolation and ruin!\n    Hearts melt and knees tremble;\nanguish\
      \ is in all loins;\n    all faces grow pale!\n"
    11: "¹¹ Where is the lions' den,\n    the feeding place of the young lions,\n\
      where the lion and lioness went,\n    where his cubs were, with none to disturb?\n"
    12: "¹² The lion tore enough for his cubs\n    and strangled prey for his lionesses;\n\
      he filled his caves with prey\n    and his dens with torn flesh. \n"
    13: ¹³ Behold, I am against you, declares the Lord of hosts, and I will burn your
      chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off
      your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be
      heard.
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to the bloody city,\n    all full of lies and plunder—\n    no end to\
      \ the prey!\n"
    2: "² The crack of the whip, and rumble of the wheel,\n    galloping horse and\
      \ bounding chariot!\n"
    3: "³ Horsemen charging,\n    flashing sword and glittering spear,\nhosts of slain,\n\
      \    heaps of corpses,\ndead bodies without end—\n    they stumble over the\
      \ bodies!\n"
    4: "⁴ And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute,\n    graceful and\
      \ of deadly charms,\nwho betrays nations with her whorings,\n    and peoples\
      \ with her charms. \n"
    5: "⁵ Behold, I am against you,\n    declares the Lord of hosts,\n    and will\
      \ lift up your skirts over your face;\nand I will make nations look at your\
      \ nakedness\n    and kingdoms at your shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will throw filth at you\n    and treat you with contempt\n    and make\
      \ you a spectacle.\n"
    7: "⁷ And all who look at you will shrink from you and say,\n“Wasted is Nineveh;\
      \ who will grieve for her?”\n    Where shall I seek comforters for you? \n"
    8: "⁸ Are you better than Thebes\n    that sat by the Nile,\nwith water around\
      \ her,\n    her rampart a sea,\n    and water her wall?\n"
    9: "⁹ Cush was her strength;\n    Egypt too, and that without limit;\n    Put\
      \ and the Libyans were her helpers. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet she became an exile;\n    she went into captivity;\nher infants were\
      \ dashed in pieces\n    at the head of every street;\nfor her honored men lots\
      \ were cast,\n    and all her great men were bound in chains.\n"
    11: "¹¹ You also will be drunken;\n    you will go into hiding;\nyou will seek\
      \ a refuge from the enemy.\n"
    12: "¹² All your fortresses are like fig trees\n    with first-ripe figs—\nif\
      \ shaken they fall\n    into the mouth of the eater.\n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, your troops\n    are women in your midst.\nThe gates of your land\n\
      \    are wide open to your enemies;\n    fire has devoured your bars. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Draw water for the siege;\n    strengthen your forts;\ngo into the clay;\n\
      \    tread the mortar;\n    take hold of the brick mold!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ There will the fire devour you;\n    the sword will cut you off.\n   \
      \ It will devour you like the locust.\nMultiply yourselves like the locust;\n\
      \    multiply like the grasshopper!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You increased your merchants\n    more than the stars of the heavens.\n\
      \    The locust spreads its wings and flies away. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your princes are like grasshoppers,\n    your scribes like clouds of locusts\n\
      settling on the fences\n    in a day of cold—\nwhen the sun rises, they fly\
      \ away;\n    no one knows where they are. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your shepherds are asleep,\n    O king of Assyria;\n    your nobles slumber.\n\
      Your people are scattered on the mountains\n    with none to gather them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ There is no easing your hurt;\n    your wound is grievous.\nAll who hear\
      \ the news about you\n    clap their hands over you.\nFor upon whom has not\
      \ come\n    your unceasing evil?"
