Zephaniah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah,\
      \ son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king\
      \ of Judah. \n"
    2: "² “I will utterly sweep away everything\n    from the face of the earth,”\
      \ declares the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ “I will sweep away man and beast;\n    I will sweep away the birds of the\
      \ heavens\n    and the fish of the sea,\nand the rubble with the wicked.\n \
      \   I will cut off mankind\n    from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ “I will stretch out my hand against Judah\n    and against all the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem;\nand I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal\n  \
      \  and the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,\n"
    5: "⁵ those who bow down on the roofs\n    to the host of the heavens,\nthose\
      \ who bow down and swear to the Lord\n    and yet swear by Milcom,\n"
    6: "⁶ those who have turned back from following the Lord,\n    who do not seek\
      \ the Lord or inquire of him.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Be silent before the Lord God!\n    For the day of the Lord is near;\nthe\
      \ Lord has prepared a sacrifice\n    and consecrated his guests.\n"
    8: "⁸ And on the day of the Lord's sacrifice—\n“I will punish the officials and\
      \ the king's sons\n    and all who array themselves in foreign attire.\n"
    9: "⁹ On that day I will punish\n    everyone who leaps over the threshold,\n\
      and those who fill their master's house\n    with violence and fraud. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “On that day,” declares the Lord,\n    “a cry will be heard from the Fish\
      \ Gate,\na wail from the Second Quarter,\n    a loud crash from the hills.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar!\n    For all the traders are no more;\n\
      \    all who weigh out silver are cut off.\n"
    12: "¹² At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps,\n    and I will punish\
      \ the men\nwho are complacent,\n    those who say in their hearts,\n‘The Lord\
      \ will not do good,\n    nor will he do ill.’\n"
    13: "¹³ Their goods shall be plundered,\n    and their houses laid waste.\nThough\
      \ they build houses,\n    they shall not inhabit them;\nthough they plant vineyards,\n\
      \    they shall not drink wine from them.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The great day of the Lord is near,\n    near and hastening fast;\nthe\
      \ sound of the day of the Lord is bitter;\n    the mighty man cries aloud there.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ A day of wrath is that day,\n    a day of distress and anguish,\na day\
      \ of ruin and devastation,\n    a day of darkness and gloom,\na day of clouds\
      \ and thick darkness,\n"
    16: "¹⁶     a day of trumpet blast and battle cry\nagainst the fortified cities\n\
      \    and against the lofty battlements. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I will bring distress on mankind,\n    so that they shall walk like the\
      \ blind,\n    because they have sinned against the Lord;\ntheir blood shall\
      \ be poured out like dust,\n    and their flesh like dung.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither their silver nor their gold\n    shall be able to deliver them\n\
      \    on the day of the wrath of the Lord.\nIn the fire of his jealousy,\n  \
      \  all the earth shall be consumed;\nfor a full and sudden end\n    he will\
      \ make of all the inhabitants of the earth."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather together, yes, gather,\n    O shameless nation,\n"
    2: "² before the decree takes effect\n    —before the day passes away like chaff—\n\
      before there comes upon you\n    the burning anger of the Lord,\nbefore there\
      \ comes upon you\n    the day of the anger of the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land,\n    who do his just commands;\n\
      seek righteousness; seek humility;\n    perhaps you may be hidden\n    on the\
      \ day of the anger of the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ For Gaza shall be deserted,\n    and Ashkelon shall become a desolation;\n\
      Ashdod's people shall be driven out at noon,\n    and Ekron shall be uprooted.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Woe to you inhabitants of the seacoast,\n    you nation of the Cherethites!\n\
      The word of the Lord is against you,\n    O Canaan, land of the Philistines;\n\
      \    and I will destroy you until no inhabitant is left.\n"
    6: "⁶ And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures,\n    with meadows for shepherds\n\
      \    and folds for flocks.\n"
    7: "⁷ The seacoast shall become the possession\n    of the remnant of the house\
      \ of Judah,\n    on which they shall graze,\nand in the houses of Ashkelon\n\
      \    they shall lie down at evening.\nFor the Lord their God will be mindful\
      \ of them\n    and restore their fortunes. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I have heard the taunts of Moab\n    and the revilings of the Ammonites,\n\
      how they have taunted my people\n    and made boasts against their territory.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord of hosts,\n    the God of Israel,\n\
      “Moab shall become like Sodom,\n    and the Ammonites like Gomorrah,\na land\
      \ possessed by nettles and salt pits,\n    and a waste forever.\nThe remnant\
      \ of my people shall plunder them,\n    and the survivors of my nation shall\
      \ possess them.”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ This shall be their lot in return for their pride,\n    because they taunted\
      \ and boasted\n    against the people of the Lord of hosts.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will be awesome against them;\n    for he will famish all the\
      \ gods of the earth,\nand to him shall bow down,\n    each in its place,\n \
      \   all the lands of the nations. \n"
    12: "¹² You also, O Cushites,\n    shall be slain by my sword. \n"
    13: "¹³ And he will stretch out his hand against the north\n    and destroy Assyria,\n\
      and he will make Nineveh a desolation,\n    a dry waste like the desert.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Herds shall lie down in her midst,\n    all kinds of beasts;\neven the\
      \ owl and the hedgehog\n    shall lodge in her capitals;\na voice shall hoot\
      \ in the window;\n    devastation will be on the threshold;\n    for her cedar\
      \ work will be laid bare.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is the exultant city\n    that lived securely,\nthat said in her\
      \ heart,\n    “I am, and there is no one else.”\nWhat a desolation she has become,\n\
      \    a lair for wild beasts!\nEveryone who passes by her\n    hisses and shakes\
      \ his fist."
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,\n    the oppressing city!\n"
    2: "² She listens to no voice;\n    she accepts no correction.\nShe does not trust\
      \ in the Lord;\n    she does not draw near to her God. \n"
    3: "³ Her officials within her\n    are roaring lions;\nher judges are evening\
      \ wolves\n    that leave nothing till the morning.\n"
    4: "⁴ Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men;\nher priests profane what is holy;\n\
      \    they do violence to the law.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord within her is righteous;\n    he does no injustice;\nevery morning\
      \ he shows forth his justice;\n    each dawn he does not fail;\n    but the\
      \ unjust knows no shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I have cut off nations;\n    their battlements are in ruins;\nI have laid\
      \ waste their streets\n    so that no one walks in them;\ntheir cities have\
      \ been made desolate,\n    without a man, without an inhabitant.\n"
    7: "⁷ I said, ‘Surely you will fear me;\n    you will accept correction.\nThen\
      \ your dwelling would not be cut off\n    according to all that I have appointed\
      \ against you.’\nBut all the more they were eager\n    to make all their deeds\
      \ corrupt. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Therefore wait for me,” declares the Lord,\n    “for the day when I rise\
      \ up to seize the prey.\nFor my decision is to gather nations,\n    to assemble\
      \ kingdoms,\nto pour out upon them my indignation,\n    all my burning anger;\n\
      for in the fire of my jealousy\n    all the earth shall be consumed. \n"
    9: "⁹ “For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples\n    to a pure\
      \ speech,\nthat all of them may call upon the name of the Lord\n    and serve\
      \ him with one accord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ From beyond the rivers of Cush\n    my worshipers, the daughter of my\
      \ dispersed ones,\n    shall bring my offering. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “On that day you shall not be put to shame\n    because of the deeds by\
      \ which you have rebelled against me;\nfor then I will remove from your midst\n\
      \    your proudly exultant ones,\nand you shall no longer be haughty\n    in\
      \ my holy mountain.\n"
    12: "¹² But I will leave in your midst\n    a people humble and lowly.\nThey shall\
      \ seek refuge in the name of the Lord,\n"
    13: "¹³     those who are left in Israel;\nthey shall do no injustice\n    and\
      \ speak no lies,\nnor shall there be found in their mouth\n    a deceitful tongue.\n\
      For they shall graze and lie down,\n    and none shall make them afraid.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;\n    shout, O Israel!\nRejoice and exult\
      \ with all your heart,\n    O daughter of Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has taken away the judgments against you;\n    he has cleared\
      \ away your enemies.\nThe King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;\n    you\
      \ shall never again fear evil.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:\n“Fear not, O Zion;\n    let\
      \ not your hands grow weak.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord your God is in your midst,\n    a mighty one who will save;\n\
      he will rejoice over you with gladness;\n    he will quiet you by his love;\n\
      he will exult over you with loud singing.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I will gather those of you who mourn for the festival,\n    so that you\
      \ will no longer suffer reproach.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, at that time I will deal\n    with all your oppressors.\nAnd I\
      \ will save the lame\n    and gather the outcast,\nand I will change their shame\
      \ into praise\n    and renown in all the earth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ At that time I will bring you in,\n    at the time when I gather you together;\n\
      for I will make you renowned and praised\n    among all the peoples of the earth,\n\
      when I restore your fortunes\n    before your eyes,” says the Lord."
