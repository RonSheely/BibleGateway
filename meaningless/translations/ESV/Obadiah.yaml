Obadiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Obadiah.\nThus says the Lord God concerning Edom:\nWe have\
      \ heard a report from the Lord,\n    and a messenger has been sent among the\
      \ nations:\n“Rise up! Let us rise against her for battle!”\n"
    2: "² Behold, I will make you small among the nations;\n    you shall be utterly\
      \ despised.\n"
    3: "³ The pride of your heart has deceived you,\n    you who live in the clefts\
      \ of the rock,\n    in your lofty dwelling,\nwho say in your heart,\n    “Who\
      \ will bring me down to the ground?”\n"
    4: "⁴ Though you soar aloft like the eagle,\n    though your nest is set among\
      \ the stars,\n    from there I will bring you down,\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ If thieves came to you,\n    if plunderers came by night—\n    how you have\
      \ been destroyed!—\n    would they not steal only enough for themselves?\nIf\
      \ grape gatherers came to you,\n    would they not leave gleanings?\n"
    6: "⁶ How Esau has been pillaged,\n    his treasures sought out!\n"
    7: "⁷ All your allies have driven you to your border;\n    those at peace with\
      \ you have deceived you;\nthey have prevailed against you;\n    those who eat\
      \ your bread have set a trap beneath you—\n    you have no understanding. \n"
    8: "⁸ Will I not on that day, declares the Lord,\n    destroy the wise men out\
      \ of Edom,\n    and understanding out of Mount Esau?\n"
    9: "⁹ And your mighty men shall be dismayed, O Teman,\n    so that every man from\
      \ Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob,\n    shame shall cover\
      \ you,\n    and you shall be cut off forever.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On the day that you stood aloof,\n    on the day that strangers carried\
      \ off his wealth\nand foreigners entered his gates\n    and cast lots for Jerusalem,\n\
      \    you were like one of them.\n"
    12: "¹² But do not gloat over the day of your brother\n    in the day of his misfortune;\n\
      do not rejoice over the people of Judah\n    in the day of their ruin;\ndo not\
      \ boast\n    in the day of distress.\n"
    13: "¹³ Do not enter the gate of my people\n    in the day of their calamity;\n\
      do not gloat over his disaster\n    in the day of his calamity;\ndo not loot\
      \ his wealth\n    in the day of his calamity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Do not stand at the crossroads\n    to cut off his fugitives;\ndo not\
      \ hand over his survivors\n    in the day of distress. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For the day of the Lord is near upon all the nations.\nAs you have done,\
      \ it shall be done to you;\n    your deeds shall return on your own head.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For as you have drunk on my holy mountain,\n    so all the nations shall\
      \ drink continually;\nthey shall drink and swallow,\n    and shall be as though\
      \ they had never been.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape,\n    and it shall be\
      \ holy,\nand the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The house of Jacob shall be a fire,\n    and the house of Joseph a flame,\n\
      \    and the house of Esau stubble;\nthey shall burn them and consume them,\n\
      \    and there shall be no survivor for the house of Esau,\nfor the Lord has\
      \ spoken. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau,\n    and those of the Shephelah\
      \ shall possess the land of the Philistines;\nthey shall possess the land of\
      \ Ephraim and the land of Samaria,\n    and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The exiles of this host of the people of Israel\n    shall possess the\
      \ land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath,\nand the exiles of Jerusalem who\
      \ are in Sepharad\n    shall possess the cities of the Negeb.\n"
    21: "²¹ Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion\n    to rule Mount Esau,\n    and the\
      \ kingdom shall be the Lord's."
