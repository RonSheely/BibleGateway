Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon\
      \ our beloved fellow worker "
    2: "² and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in\
      \ your house: \n"
    3: "³ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: '⁴ I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, '
    5: '⁵ because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord
      Jesus and for all the saints, '
    6: '⁶ and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full
      knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. '
    7: "⁷ For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because\
      \ the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. \n"
    8: '⁸ Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what
      is required, '
    9: "⁹ yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now\
      \ a prisoner also for Christ Jesus— "
    10: '¹⁰ I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. '
    11: '¹¹ (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and
      to me.) '
    12: '¹² I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. '
    13: '¹³ I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve
      me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, '
    14: '¹⁴ but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your
      goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. '
    15: '¹⁵ For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might
      have him back forever, '
    16: "¹⁶ no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—especially\
      \ to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. '
    18: '¹⁸ If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my
      account. '
    19: '¹⁹ I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of
      your owing me even your own self. '
    20: "²⁰ Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart\
      \ in Christ. \n"
    21: '²¹ Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do
      even more than I say. '
    22: "²² At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through\
      \ your prayers I will be graciously given to you. \n"
    23: '²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, '
    24: "²⁴ and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
