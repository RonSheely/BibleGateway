2 Timothy:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, for the sake of the\
      \ promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, \n"
    2: "² To Timothy, my beloved child:\nGrace, mercy, and peace from God the Father\
      \ and Christ Jesus our Lord. \n"
    3: '³ I am grateful to God—whom I worship with a clear conscience, as my ancestors
      did—when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. '
    4: '⁴ Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. '
    5: '⁵ I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that lived first in your grandmother
      Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, lives in you. '
    6: '⁶ For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within
      you through the laying on of my hands; '
    7: "⁷ for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power\
      \ and of love and of self-discipline. \n"
    8: '⁸ Do not be ashamed, then, of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner,
      but join with me in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God, '
    9: '⁹ who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works
      but according to his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ
      Jesus before the ages began, '
    10: '¹⁰ but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ
      Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through
      the gospel. '
    11: '¹¹ For this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher, '
    12: '¹² and for this reason I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know
      the one in whom I have put my trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard
      until that day what I have entrusted to him. '
    13: '¹³ Hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in
      the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. '
    14: "¹⁴ Guard the good treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit\
      \ living in us. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ You are aware that all who are in Asia have turned away from me, including
      Phygelus and Hermogenes. '
    16: '¹⁶ May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often
      refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain; '
    17: '¹⁷ when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me '
    18: ¹⁸ —may the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day!
      And you know very well how much service he rendered in Ephesus.
  2:
    1: '¹ You then, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; '
    2: '² and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful
      people who will be able to teach others as well. '
    3: '³ Share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. '
    4: '⁴ No one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs; the soldier’s
      aim is to please the enlisting officer. '
    5: '⁵ And in the case of an athlete, no one is crowned without competing according
      to the rules. '
    6: '⁶ It is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of
      the crops. '
    7: "⁷ Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David—that
      is my gospel, '
    9: '⁹ for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal.
      But the word of God is not chained. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they
      may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. '
    11: "¹¹ The saying is sure:\nIf we have died with him, we will also live with\
      \ him;\n"
    12: "¹² if we endure, we will also reign with him;\nif we deny him, he will also\
      \ deny us;\n"
    13: "¹³ if we are faithless, he remains faithful—\nfor he cannot deny himself.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Remind them of this, and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling
      over words, which does no good but only ruins those who are listening. '
    15: '¹⁵ Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him, a worker
      who has no need to be ashamed, rightly explaining the word of truth. '
    16: '¹⁶ Avoid profane chatter, for it will lead people into more and more impiety, '
    17: '¹⁷ and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and
      Philetus, '
    18: '¹⁸ who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has
      already taken place. They are upsetting the faith of some. '
    19: "¹⁹ But God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this inscription: “The Lord\
      \ knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who calls on the name of the\
      \ Lord turn away from wickedness.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ In a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also
      of wood and clay, some for special use, some for ordinary. '
    21: '²¹ All who cleanse themselves of the things I have mentioned will become
      special utensils, dedicated and useful to the owner of the house, ready for
      every good work. '
    22: '²² Shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace,
      along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. '
    23: '²³ Have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies; you know that
      they breed quarrels. '
    24: '²⁴ And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone,
      an apt teacher, patient, '
    25: '²⁵ correcting opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they
      will repent and come to know the truth, '
    26: ²⁶ and that they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been held
      captive by him to do his will.
  3:
    1: '¹ You must understand this, that in the last days distressing times will come. '
    2: '² For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant,
      abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, '
    3: '³ inhuman, implacable, slanderers, profligates, brutes, haters of good, '
    4: '⁴ treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than
      lovers of God, '
    5: '⁵ holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid them! '
    6: '⁶ For among them are those who make their way into households and captivate
      silly women, overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires, '
    7: '⁷ who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the
      truth. '
    8: '⁸ As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people, of corrupt mind and
      counterfeit faith, also oppose the truth. '
    9: "⁹ But they will not make much progress, because, as in the case of those two\
      \ men, their folly will become plain to everyone. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith,
      my patience, my love, my steadfastness, '
    11: '¹¹ my persecutions, and my suffering the things that happened to me in Antioch,
      Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from
      all of them. '
    12: '¹² Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. '
    13: '¹³ But wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others
      and being deceived. '
    14: '¹⁴ But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed,
      knowing from whom you learned it, '
    15: '¹⁵ and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able
      to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. '
    16: '¹⁶ All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof,
      for correction, and for training in righteousness, '
    17: ¹⁷ so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every
      good work.
  4:
    1: '¹ In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and
      the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: '
    2: '² proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable;
      convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. '
    3: '³ For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine,
      but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit
      their own desires, '
    4: '⁴ and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. '
    5: "⁵ As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist,\
      \ carry out your ministry fully. \n"
    6: '⁶ As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of
      my departure has come. '
    7: '⁷ I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the
      faith. '
    8: "⁸ From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the\
      \ Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but\
      \ also to all who have longed for his appearing. \n"
    9: '⁹ Do your best to come to me soon, '
    10: '¹⁰ for Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to
      Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. '
    11: '¹¹ Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful
      in my ministry. '
    12: '¹² I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. '
    13: '¹³ When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also
      the books, and above all the parchments. '
    14: '¹⁴ Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will pay him back
      for his deeds. '
    15: "¹⁵ You also must beware of him, for he strongly opposed our message. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At my first defense no one came to my support, but all deserted me. May
      it not be counted against them! '
    17: '¹⁷ But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the
      message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was
      rescued from the lion’s mouth. '
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly\
      \ kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. '
    20: '²⁰ Erastus remained in Corinth; Trophimus I left ill in Miletus. '
    21: "²¹ Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as\
      \ do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers and sisters. \n"
    22: ²² The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
