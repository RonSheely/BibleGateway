    16: "¹⁶ for their feet run to evil,\n    and they hurry to shed blood.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For in vain is the net baited\n    while the bird is looking on;\n"
    18: "¹⁸ yet they lie in wait—to kill themselves!\n    and set an ambush—for their\
      \ own lives!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Such is the end of all who are greedy for gain;\n    it takes away the\

      \ my reproof,\n"
    26: "²⁶ I also will laugh at your calamity;\n    I will mock when panic strikes\
      \ you,\n"
    27: "²⁷ when panic strikes you like a storm,\n    and your calamity comes like\
      \ a whirlwind,\n    when distress and anguish come upon you.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;\n    they will seek\
      \ me diligently, but will not find me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because they hated knowledge\n    and did not choose the fear of the Lord,\n"
    30: "³⁰ would have none of my counsel,\n    and despised all my reproof,\n"
    31: "³¹ therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way\n    and be sated with\

    9: "⁹ She will place on your head a fair garland;\n    she will bestow on you\
      \ a beautiful crown.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear, my child, and accept my words,\n    that the years of your life\
      \ may be many.\n"

      \ evildoers.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Avoid it; do not go on it;\n    turn away from it and pass on.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;\n    they are robbed\

    1: "¹ My child, be attentive to my wisdom;\n    incline your ear to my understanding,\n"
    2: "² so that you may hold on to prudence,\n    and your lips may guard knowledge.\n"
    3: "³ For the lips of a loose woman drip honey,\n    and her speech is smoother\
      \ than oil;\n"
    4: "⁴ but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,\n    sharp as a two-edged sword.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her feet go down to death;\n    her steps follow the path to Sheol.\n"
    6: "⁶ She does not keep straight to the path of life;\n    her ways wander, and\
      \ she does not know it. \n"
    7: "⁷ And now, my child, listen to me,\n    and do not depart from the words of\
      \ my mouth.\n"
    8: "⁸ Keep your way far from her,\n    and do not go near the door of her house;\n"
    9: "⁹ or you will give your honor to others,\n    and your years to the merciless,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ and strangers will take their fill of your wealth,\n    and your labors\
      \ will go to the house of an alien;\n"
    11: "¹¹ and at the end of your life you will groan,\n    when your flesh and body\
      \ are consumed,\n"
    12: "¹² and you say, “Oh, how I hated discipline,\n    and my heart despised reproof!\n"
    13: "¹³ I did not listen to the voice of my teachers\n    or incline my ear to\
      \ my instructors.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now I am at the point of utter ruin\n    in the public assembly.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Drink water from your own cistern,\n    flowing water from your own well.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Should your springs be scattered abroad,\n    streams of water in the\
      \ streets?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let them be for yourself alone,\n    and not for sharing with strangers.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let your fountain be blessed,\n    and rejoice in the wife of your youth,\n"
    19: "¹⁹     a lovely deer, a graceful doe.\nMay her breasts satisfy you at all\
      \ times;\n    may you be intoxicated always by her love.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Why should you be intoxicated, my son, by another woman\n    and embrace\
      \ the bosom of an adulteress?\n"
    21: "²¹ For human ways are under the eyes of the Lord,\n    and he examines all\
      \ their paths.\n"
    22: "²² The iniquities of the wicked ensnare them,\n    and they are caught in\
      \ the toils of their sin.\n"
    23: "²³ They die for lack of discipline,\n    and because of their great folly\
      \ they are lost."

    1: "¹ My child, if you have given your pledge to your neighbor,\n    if you have\
      \ bound yourself to another,\n"
    2: "² you are snared by the utterance of your lips,\n    caught by the words of\
      \ your mouth.\n"
    3: "³ So do this, my child, and save yourself,\n    for you have come into your\
      \ neighbor’s power:\n    go, hurry, and plead with your neighbor.\n"
    4: "⁴ Give your eyes no sleep\n    and your eyelids no slumber;\n"
    5: "⁵ save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter,\n    like a bird from the\
      \ hand of the fowler. \n"
    6: "⁶ Go to the ant, you lazybones;\n    consider its ways, and be wise.\n"
    7: "⁷ Without having any chief\n    or officer or ruler,\n"
    8: "⁸ it prepares its food in summer,\n    and gathers its sustenance in harvest.\n"
    9: "⁹ How long will you lie there, O lazybones?\n    When will you rise from your\
      \ sleep?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A little sleep, a little slumber,\n    a little folding of the hands to\
      \ rest,\n"
    11: "¹¹ and poverty will come upon you like a robber,\n    and want, like an armed\
      \ warrior. \n"
    12: "¹² A scoundrel and a villain\n    goes around with crooked speech,\n"
    13: "¹³ winking the eyes, shuffling the feet,\n    pointing the fingers,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ with perverted mind devising evil,\n    continually sowing discord;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ on such a one calamity will descend suddenly;\n    in a moment, damage\
      \ beyond repair. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ There are six things that the Lord hates,\n    seven that are an abomination\
      \ to him:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ haughty eyes, a lying tongue,\n    and hands that shed innocent blood,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ a heart that devises wicked plans,\n    feet that hurry to run to evil,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ a lying witness who testifies falsely,\n    and one who sows discord in\
      \ a family. \n"
    20: "²⁰ My child, keep your father’s commandment,\n    and do not forsake your\
      \ mother’s teaching.\n"
    21: "²¹ Bind them upon your heart always;\n    tie them around your neck.\n"
    22: "²² When you walk, they will lead you;\n    when you lie down, they will watch\
      \ over you;\n    and when you awake, they will talk with you.\n"
    23: "²³ For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,\n    and the reproofs\
      \ of discipline are the way of life,\n"
    24: "²⁴ to preserve you from the wife of another,\n    from the smooth tongue\
      \ of the adulteress.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not desire her beauty in your heart,\n    and do not let her capture\
      \ you with her eyelashes;\n"
    26: "²⁶ for a prostitute’s fee is only a loaf of bread,\n    but the wife of another\
      \ stalks a man’s very life.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Can fire be carried in the bosom\n    without burning one’s clothes?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Or can one walk on hot coals\n    without scorching the feet?\n"
    29: "²⁹ So is he who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife;\n    no one who touches\
      \ her will go unpunished.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Thieves are not despised who steal only\n    to satisfy their appetite\
      \ when they are hungry.\n"
    31: "³¹ Yet if they are caught, they will pay sevenfold;\n    they will forfeit\
      \ all the goods of their house.\n"
    32: "³² But he who commits adultery has no sense;\n    he who does it destroys\
      \ himself.\n"
    33: "³³ He will get wounds and dishonor,\n    and his disgrace will not be wiped\
      \ away.\n"
    34: "³⁴ For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury,\n    and he shows no restraint\
      \ when he takes revenge.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He will accept no compensation,\n    and refuses a bribe no matter how\
      \ great."
  7:

    8: "⁸ passing along the street near her corner,\n    taking the road to her house\n"
    9: "⁹ in the twilight, in the evening,\n    at the time of night and darkness.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then a woman comes toward him,\n    decked out like a prostitute, wily\
      \ of heart.\n"
    11: "¹¹ She is loud and wayward;\n    her feet do not stay at home;\n"
    12: "¹² now in the street, now in the squares,\n    and at every corner she lies\
      \ in wait.\n"
    13: "¹³ She seizes him and kisses him,\n    and with impudent face she says to\
      \ him:\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I had to offer sacrifices,\n    and today I have paid my vows;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ so now I have come out to meet you,\n    to seek you eagerly, and I have\
      \ found you!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I have decked my couch with coverings,\n    colored spreads of Egyptian\
      \ linen;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,\n    aloes, and cinnamon.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Come, let us take our fill of love until morning;\n    let us delight\
      \ ourselves with love.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For my husband is not at home;\n    he has gone on a long journey.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He took a bag of money with him;\n    he will not come home until full\
      \ moon.” \n"
    21: "²¹ With much seductive speech she persuades him;\n    with her smooth talk\
      \ she compels him.\n"
    22: "²² Right away he follows her,\n    and goes like an ox to the slaughter,\n\
      or bounds like a stag toward the trap\n"
