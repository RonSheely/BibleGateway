      \ is strong as death,\n    passion fierce as the grave.\nIts flashes are flashes\
      \ of fire,\n    a raging flame.\n"
    7: "⁷ Many waters cannot quench love,\n    neither can floods drown it.\nIf one\
      \ offered for love\n    all the wealth of one’s house,\n    it would be utterly\
      \ scorned. \n"
    8: "⁸ We have a little sister,\n    and she has no breasts.\nWhat shall we do\
      \ for our sister,\n    on the day when she is spoken for?\n"
    9: "⁹ If she is a wall,\n    we will build upon her a battlement of silver;\n\
      but if she is a door,\n    we will enclose her with boards of cedar.\n"

      \ eyes\n    as one who brings peace.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;\n    he entrusted the vineyard to\
      \ keepers;\n    each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.\n"
