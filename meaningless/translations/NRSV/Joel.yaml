Joel:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel: \n"
    2: "² Hear this, O elders,\n    give ear, all inhabitants of the land!\nHas such\
      \ a thing happened in your days,\n    or in the days of your ancestors?\n"
    3: "³ Tell your children of it,\n    and let your children tell their children,\n\
      \    and their children another generation. \n"
    4: "⁴ What the cutting locust left,\n    the swarming locust has eaten.\nWhat\
      \ the swarming locust left,\n    the hopping locust has eaten,\nand what the\
      \ hopping locust left,\n    the destroying locust has eaten. \n"
    5: "⁵ Wake up, you drunkards, and weep;\n    and wail, all you wine-drinkers,\n\
      over the sweet wine,\n    for it is cut off from your mouth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For a nation has invaded my land,\n    powerful and innumerable;\nits teeth\
      \ are lions’ teeth,\n    and it has the fangs of a lioness.\n"
    7: "⁷ It has laid waste my vines,\n    and splintered my fig trees;\nit has stripped\
      \ off their bark and thrown it down;\n    their branches have turned white.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Lament like a virgin dressed in sackcloth\n    for the husband of her youth.\n"
    9: "⁹ The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off\n    from the house\
      \ of the Lord.\nThe priests mourn,\n    the ministers of the Lord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The fields are devastated,\n    the ground mourns;\nfor the grain is destroyed,\n\
      \    the wine dries up,\n    the oil fails. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Be dismayed, you farmers,\n    wail, you vinedressers,\nover the wheat\
      \ and the barley;\n    for the crops of the field are ruined.\n"
    12: "¹² The vine withers,\n    the fig tree droops.\nPomegranate, palm, and apple—\n\
      \    all the trees of the field are dried up;\nsurely, joy withers away\n  \
      \  among the people. \n"
    13: "¹³ Put on sackcloth and lament, you priests;\n    wail, you ministers of\
      \ the altar.\nCome, pass the night in sackcloth,\n    you ministers of my God!\n\
      Grain offering and drink offering\n    are withheld from the house of your God.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sanctify a fast,\n    call a solemn assembly.\nGather the elders\n   \
      \ and all the inhabitants of the land\nto the house of the Lord your God,\n\
      \    and cry out to the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Alas for the day!\nFor the day of the Lord is near,\n    and as destruction\
      \ from the Almighty it comes.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Is not the food cut off\n    before our eyes,\njoy and gladness\n    from\
      \ the house of our God? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seed shrivels under the clods,\n    the storehouses are desolate;\n\
      the granaries are ruined\n    because the grain has failed.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ How the animals groan!\n    The herds of cattle wander about\nbecause\
      \ there is no pasture for them;\n    even the flocks of sheep are dazed. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ To you, O Lord, I cry.\nFor fire has devoured\n    the pastures of the\
      \ wilderness,\nand flames have burned\n    all the trees of the field.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Even the wild animals cry to you\n    because the watercourses are dried\
      \ up,\nand fire has devoured\n    the pastures of the wilderness."
  2:
    1: "¹ Blow the trumpet in Zion;\n    sound the alarm on my holy mountain!\nLet\
      \ all the inhabitants of the land tremble,\n    for the day of the Lord is coming,\
      \ it is near—\n"
    2: "² a day of darkness and gloom,\n    a day of clouds and thick darkness!\n\
      Like blackness spread upon the mountains\n    a great and powerful army comes;\n\
      their like has never been from of old,\n    nor will be again after them\n \
      \   in ages to come. \n"
    3: "³ Fire devours in front of them,\n    and behind them a flame burns.\nBefore\
      \ them the land is like the garden of Eden,\n    but after them a desolate wilderness,\n\
      \    and nothing escapes them. \n"
    4: "⁴ They have the appearance of horses,\n    and like war-horses they charge.\n"
    5: "⁵ As with the rumbling of chariots,\n    they leap on the tops of the mountains,\n\
      like the crackling of a flame of fire\n    devouring the stubble,\nlike a powerful\
      \ army\n    drawn up for battle. \n"
    6: "⁶ Before them peoples are in anguish,\n    all faces grow pale.\n"
    7: "⁷ Like warriors they charge,\n    like soldiers they scale the wall.\nEach\
      \ keeps to its own course,\n    they do not swerve from their paths.\n"
    8: "⁸ They do not jostle one another,\n    each keeps to its own track;\nthey\
      \ burst through the weapons\n    and are not halted.\n"
    9: "⁹ They leap upon the city,\n    they run upon the walls;\nthey climb up into\
      \ the houses,\n    they enter through the windows like a thief. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The earth quakes before them,\n    the heavens tremble.\nThe sun and the\
      \ moon are darkened,\n    and the stars withdraw their shining.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord utters his voice\n    at the head of his army;\nhow vast is his\
      \ host!\n    Numberless are those who obey his command.\nTruly the day of the\
      \ Lord is great;\n    terrible indeed—who can endure it? \n"
    12: "¹² Yet even now, says the Lord,\n    return to me with all your heart,\n\
      with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;\n"
    13: "¹³     rend your hearts and not your clothing.\nReturn to the Lord, your\
      \ God,\n    for he is gracious and merciful,\nslow to anger, and abounding in\
      \ steadfast love,\n    and relents from punishing.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,\n    and leave a blessing\
      \ behind him,\na grain offering and a drink offering\n    for the Lord, your\
      \ God? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Blow the trumpet in Zion;\n    sanctify a fast;\ncall a solemn assembly;\n"
    16: "¹⁶     gather the people.\nSanctify the congregation;\n    assemble the aged;\n\
      gather the children,\n    even infants at the breast.\nLet the bridegroom leave\
      \ his room,\n    and the bride her canopy. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Between the vestibule and the altar\n    let the priests, the ministers\
      \ of the Lord, weep.\nLet them say, “Spare your people, O Lord,\n    and do\
      \ not make your heritage a mockery,\n    a byword among the nations.\nWhy should\
      \ it be said among the peoples,\n    ‘Where is their God?’” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Lord became jealous for his land,\n    and had pity on his people.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ In response to his people the Lord said:\nI am sending you\n    grain,\
      \ wine, and oil,\n    and you will be satisfied;\nand I will no more make you\n\
      \    a mockery among the nations. \n"
    20: "²⁰ I will remove the northern army far from you,\n    and drive it into a\
      \ parched and desolate land,\nits front into the eastern sea,\n    and its rear\
      \ into the western sea;\nits stench and foul smell will rise up.\n    Surely\
      \ he has done great things! \n"
    21: "²¹ Do not fear, O soil;\n    be glad and rejoice,\n    for the Lord has done\
      \ great things!\n"
    22: "²² Do not fear, you animals of the field,\n    for the pastures of the wilderness\
      \ are green;\nthe tree bears its fruit,\n    the fig tree and vine give their\
      \ full yield. \n"
    23: "²³ O children of Zion, be glad\n    and rejoice in the Lord your God;\nfor\
      \ he has given the early rain for your vindication,\n    he has poured down\
      \ for you abundant rain,\n    the early and the later rain, as before.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The threshing floors shall be full of grain,\n    the vats shall overflow\
      \ with wine and oil. \n"
    25: "²⁵ I will repay you for the years\n    that the swarming locust has eaten,\n\
      the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter,\n    my great army, which I sent\
      \ against you. \n"
    26: "²⁶ You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,\n    and praise the name of\
      \ the Lord your God,\n    who has dealt wondrously with you.\nAnd my people\
      \ shall never again be put to shame.\n"
    27: "²⁷ You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,\n    and that I, the\
      \ Lord, am your God and there is no other.\nAnd my people shall never again\
      \ be put to shame. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Then afterward\n    I will pour out my spirit on all flesh;\nyour sons\
      \ and your daughters shall prophesy,\n    your old men shall dream dreams,\n\
      \    and your young men shall see visions.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Even on the male and female slaves,\n    in those days, I will pour out\
      \ my spirit. \n"
    30: '³⁰ I will show portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and
      columns of smoke. '
    31: '³¹ The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the
      great and terrible day of the Lord comes. '
    32: ³² Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved; for in
      Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has
      said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls.
  3:
    1: '¹ For then, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of
      Judah and Jerusalem, '
    2: '² I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat,
      and I will enter into judgment with them there, on account of my people and
      my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations. They
      have divided my land, '
    3: "³ and cast lots for my people, and traded boys for prostitutes, and sold girls\
      \ for wine, and drunk it down. \n"
    4: '⁴ What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia?
      Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will turn
      your deeds back upon your own heads swiftly and speedily. '
    5: '⁵ For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures
      into your temples. '
    6: '⁶ You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, removing
      them far from their own border. '
    7: '⁷ But now I will rouse them to leave the places to which you have sold them,
      and I will turn your deeds back upon your own heads. '
    8: "⁸ I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of\
      \ Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away; for the\
      \ Lord has spoken. \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim this among the nations:\nPrepare war,\n    stir up the warriors.\n\
      Let all the soldiers draw near,\n    let them come up.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Beat your plowshares into swords,\n    and your pruning hooks into spears;\n\
      \    let the weakling say, “I am a warrior.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Come quickly,\n    all you nations all around,\n    gather yourselves\
      \ there.\nBring down your warriors, O Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² Let the nations rouse themselves,\n    and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;\n\
      for there I will sit to judge\n    all the neighboring nations. \n"
    13: "¹³ Put in the sickle,\n    for the harvest is ripe.\nGo in, tread,\n    for\
      \ the wine press is full.\nThe vats overflow,\n    for their wickedness is great.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Multitudes, multitudes,\n    in the valley of decision!\nFor the day of\
      \ the Lord is near\n    in the valley of decision.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sun and the moon are darkened,\n    and the stars withdraw their shining.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord roars from Zion,\n    and utters his voice from Jerusalem,\n\
      \    and the heavens and the earth shake.\nBut the Lord is a refuge for his\
      \ people,\n    a stronghold for the people of Israel. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ So you shall know that I, the Lord your God,\n    dwell in Zion, my holy\
      \ mountain.\nAnd Jerusalem shall be holy,\n    and strangers shall never again\
      \ pass through it. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ In that day\nthe mountains shall drip sweet wine,\n    the hills shall\
      \ flow with milk,\nand all the stream beds of Judah\n    shall flow with water;\n\
      a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord\n    and water the Wadi\
      \ Shittim. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Egypt shall become a desolation\n    and Edom a desolate wilderness,\n\
      because of the violence done to the people of Judah,\n    in whose land they\
      \ have shed innocent blood.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But Judah shall be inhabited forever,\n    and Jerusalem to all generations.\n"
    21: "²¹ I will avenge their blood, and I will not clear the guilty,\n    for the\
      \ Lord dwells in Zion."
