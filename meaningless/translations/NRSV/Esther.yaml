Esther:
  1:
    1: '¹ This happened in the days of Ahasuerus, the same Ahasuerus who ruled over
      one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia. '
    2: '² In those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in the citadel
      of Susa, '
    3: '³ in the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his officials
      and ministers. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of
      the provinces were present, '
    4: "⁴ while he displayed the great wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and\
      \ pomp of his majesty for many days, one hundred eighty days in all. \n"
    5: '⁵ When these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present
      in the citadel of Susa, both great and small, a banquet lasting for seven days,
      in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. '
    6: '⁶ There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings tied with cords of fine
      linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. There were couches of gold
      and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and colored
      stones. '
    7: '⁷ Drinks were served in golden goblets, goblets of different kinds, and the
      royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king. '
    8: '⁸ Drinking was by flagons, without restraint; for the king had given orders
      to all the officials of his palace to do as each one desired. '
    9: "⁹ Furthermore, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the palace of\
      \ King Ahasuerus. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman,
      Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who
      attended him, '
    11: '¹¹ to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing the royal crown, in order
      to show the peoples and the officials her beauty; for she was fair to behold. '
    12: "¹² But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command conveyed by the\
      \ eunuchs. At this the king was enraged, and his anger burned within him. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the king consulted the sages who knew the laws (for this was the
      king’s procedure toward all who were versed in law and custom, '
    14: '¹⁴ and those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,
      Marsena, and Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media, who had access
      to the king, and sat first in the kingdom): '
    15: '¹⁵ “According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti because she
      has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed by the eunuchs?” '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, “Not
      only has Queen Vashti done wrong to the king, but also to all the officials
      and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. '
    17: '¹⁷ For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them
      to look with contempt on their husbands, since they will say, ‘King Ahasuerus
      commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.’ '
    18: '¹⁸ This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the
      queen’s behavior will rebel against the king’s officials, and there will be
      no end of contempt and wrath! '
    19: '¹⁹ If it pleases the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it
      be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be
      altered, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the
      king give her royal position to another who is better than she. '
    20: "²⁰ So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom,\
      \ vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ This advice pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan
      proposed; '
    22: ²² he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own
      script and to every people in its own language, declaring that every man should
      be master in his own house.
  2:
    1: '¹ After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered
      Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. '
    2: '² Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Let beautiful young virgins
      be sought out for the king. '
    3: '³ And let the king appoint commissioners in all the provinces of his kingdom
      to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in the citadel of Susa
      under custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; let
      their cosmetic treatments be given them. '
    4: "⁴ And let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This\
      \ pleased the king, and he did so. \n"
    5: '⁵ Now there was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of
      Jair son of Shimei son of Kish, a Benjaminite. '
    6: '⁶ Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away
      with King Jeconiah of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried
      away. '
    7: '⁷ Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is Esther, his cousin, for she had
      neither father nor mother; the girl was fair and beautiful, and when her father
      and her mother died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter. '
    8: '⁸ So when the king’s order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many young
      women were gathered in the citadel of Susa in custody of Hegai, Esther also
      was taken into the king’s palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge
      of the women. '
    9: '⁹ The girl pleased him and won his favor, and he quickly provided her with
      her cosmetic treatments and her portion of food, and with seven chosen maids
      from the king’s palace, and advanced her and her maids to the best place in
      the harem. '
    10: '¹⁰ Esther did not reveal her people or kindred, for Mordecai had charged
      her not to tell. '
    11: "¹¹ Every day Mordecai would walk around in front of the court of the harem,\
      \ to learn how Esther was and how she fared. \n"
    12: '¹² The turn came for each girl to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve
      months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period
      of their cosmetic treatment, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with
      perfumes and cosmetics for women. '
    13: '¹³ When the girl went in to the king she was given whatever she asked for
      to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. '
    14: "¹⁴ In the evening she went in; then in the morning she came back to the second\
      \ harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who was in charge of the\
      \ concubines; she did not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted\
      \ in her and she was summoned by name. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When the turn came for Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai,
      who had adopted her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for
      nothing except what Hegai the king’s eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised.
      Now Esther was admired by all who saw her. '
    16: '¹⁶ When Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his royal palace in the tenth
      month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign, '
    17: '¹⁷ the king loved Esther more than all the other women; of all the virgins
      she won his favor and devotion, so that he set the royal crown on her head and
      made her queen instead of Vashti. '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the king gave a great banquet to all his officials and ministers—“Esther’s\
      \ banquet.” He also granted a holiday to the provinces, and gave gifts with\
      \ royal liberality. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When the virgins were being gathered together, Mordecai was sitting at
      the king’s gate. '
    20: '²⁰ Now Esther had not revealed her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had
      charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him. '
    21: '²¹ In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan
      and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry
      and conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. '
    22: '²² But the matter came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen
      Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai. '
    23: ²³ When the affair was investigated and found to be so, both the men were
      hanged on the gallows. It was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence
      of the king.
  3:
    1: '¹ After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
      and advanced him and set his seat above all the officials who were with him. '
    2: '² And all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and did
      obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai
      did not bow down or do obeisance. '
    3: '³ Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why
      do you disobey the king’s command?” '
    4: '⁴ When they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they
      told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai’s words would avail; for he had
      told them that he was a Jew. '
    5: '⁵ When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman
      was infuriated. '
    6: "⁶ But he thought it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, having\
      \ been told who Mordecai’s people were, Haman plotted to destroy all the Jews,\
      \ the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. \n"
    7: '⁷ In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of
      King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur—which means “the lot”—before Haman for the day
      and for the month, and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
      which is the month of Adar. '
    8: '⁸ Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered
      and separated among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their
      laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the
      king’s laws, so that it is not appropriate for the king to tolerate them. '
    9: '⁹ If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued for their destruction, and
      I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge
      of the king’s business, so that they may put it into the king’s treasuries.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son
      of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. '
    11: "¹¹ The king said to Haman, “The money is given to you, and the people as\
      \ well, to do with them as it seems good to you.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the king’s secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the
      first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written
      to the king’s satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the
      officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every
      people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and
      sealed with the king’s ring. '
    13: '¹³ Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, giving orders
      to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children,
      in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar,
      and to plunder their goods. '
    14: '¹⁴ A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province
      by proclamation, calling on all the peoples to be ready for that day. '
    15: ¹⁵ The couriers went quickly by order of the king, and the decree was issued
      in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of
      Susa was thrown into confusion.
  4:
    1: '¹ When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes
      and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud
      and bitter cry; '
    2: '² he went up to the entrance of the king’s gate, for no one might enter the
      king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. '
    3: "³ In every province, wherever the king’s command and his decree came, there\
      \ was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting,\
      \ and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. \n"
    4: '⁴ When Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply
      distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off
      his sackcloth; but he would not accept them. '
    5: '⁵ Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, who had been
      appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what was
      happening and why. '
    6: '⁶ Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of
      the king’s gate, '
    7: '⁷ and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of
      money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries for the destruction
      of the Jews. '
    8: "⁸ Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their\
      \ destruction, that he might show it to Esther, explain it to her, and charge\
      \ her to go to the king to make supplication to him and entreat him for her\
      \ people. \n"
    9: '⁹ Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mordecai, saying, '
    11: '¹¹ “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that
      if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called,
      there is but one law—all alike are to be put to death. Only if the king holds
      out the golden scepter to someone, may that person live. I myself have not been
      called to come in to the king for thirty days.” '
    12: '¹² When they told Mordecai what Esther had said, '
    13: '¹³ Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think that in the king’s
      palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. '
    14: '¹⁴ For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance
      will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father’s family
      will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such
      a time as this.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Esther said in reply to Mordecai, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf,
      and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will
      also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against
      the law; and if I perish, I perish.” '
    17: ¹⁷ Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
  5:
    1: '¹ On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court
      of the king’s palace, opposite the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his
      royal throne inside the palace opposite the entrance to the palace. '
    2: '² As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won his
      favor and he held out to her the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther
      approached and touched the top of the scepter. '
    3: '³ The king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It
      shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.” '
    4: '⁴ Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today
      to a banquet that I have prepared for the king.” '
    5: '⁵ Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther desires.”
      So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. '
    6: '⁶ While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition?
      It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom,
      it shall be fulfilled.” '
    7: '⁷ Then Esther said, “This is my petition and request: '
    8: "⁸ If I have won the king’s favor, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition\
      \ and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet\
      \ that I will prepare for them, and then I will do as the king has said.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Haman went out that day happy and in good spirits. But when Haman saw Mordecai
      in the king’s gate, and observed that he neither rose nor trembled before him,
      he was infuriated with Mordecai; '
    10: '¹⁰ nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. Then he sent and
      called for his friends and his wife Zeresh, '
    11: '¹¹ and Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of
      his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he
      had advanced him above the officials and the ministers of the king. '
    12: '¹² Haman added, “Even Queen Esther let no one but myself come with the king
      to the banquet that she prepared. Tomorrow also I am invited by her, together
      with the king. '
    13: '¹³ Yet all this does me no good so long as I see the Jew Mordecai sitting
      at the king’s gate.” '
    14: ¹⁴ Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows fifty
      cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged
      on it; then go with the king to the banquet in good spirits.” This advice pleased
      Haman, and he had the gallows made.
  6:
    1: '¹ On that night the king could not sleep, and he gave orders to bring the
      book of records, the annals, and they were read to the king. '
    2: '² It was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two
      of the king’s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had conspired to assassinate
      King Ahasuerus. '
    3: '³ Then the king said, “What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai
      for this?” The king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done
      for him.” '
    4: '⁴ The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer
      court of the king’s palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged
      on the gallows that he had prepared for him. '
    5: '⁵ So the king’s servants told him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.”
      The king said, “Let him come in.” '
    6: '⁶ So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What shall be done for the
      man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king
      wish to honor more than me?” '
    7: '⁷ So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor, '
    8: '⁸ let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and a horse that the
      king has ridden, with a royal crown on its head. '
    9: '⁹ Let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble
      officials; let him robe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him conduct
      the man on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before
      him: ‘Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.’” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the king said to Haman, “Quickly, take the robes and the horse, as
      you have said, and do so to the Jew Mordecai who sits at the king’s gate. Leave
      out nothing that you have mentioned.” '
    11: "¹¹ So Haman took the robes and the horse and robed Mordecai and led him riding\
      \ through the open square of the city, proclaiming, “Thus shall it be done for\
      \ the man whom the king wishes to honor.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house,
      mourning and with his head covered. '
    13: "¹³ When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had\
      \ happened to him, his advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai,\
      \ before whom your downfall has begun, is of the Jewish people, you will not\
      \ prevail against him, but will surely fall before him.” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and
      hurried Haman off to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
  7:
    1: '¹ So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. '
    2: '² On the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther,
      “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your
      request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.” '
    3: '³ Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have won your favor, O king, and if it
      pleases the king, let my life be given me—that is my petition—and the lives
      of my people—that is my request. '
    4: '⁴ For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and
      to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would
      have held my peace; but no enemy can compensate for this damage to the king.” '
    5: '⁵ Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who
      has presumed to do this?” '
    6: '⁶ Esther said, “A foe and enemy, this wicked Haman!” Then Haman was terrified
      before the king and the queen. '
    7: '⁷ The king rose from the feast in wrath and went into the palace garden, but
      Haman stayed to beg his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that the king had
      determined to destroy him. '
    8: '⁸ When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman
      had thrown himself on the couch where Esther was reclining; and the king said,
      “Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?” As the words
      left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman’s face. '
    9: '⁹ Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, “Look,
      the very gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the
      king, stands at Haman’s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang
      him on that.” '
    10: ¹⁰ So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.
      Then the anger of the king abated.
  8:
    1: '¹ On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the
      enemy of the Jews; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what
      he was to her. '
    2: "² Then the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and\
      \ gave it to Mordecai. So Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. \n"
    3: '³ Then Esther spoke again to the king; she fell at his feet, weeping and pleading
      with him to avert the evil design of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he
      had devised against the Jews. '
    4: '⁴ The king held out the golden scepter to Esther, '
    5: '⁵ and Esther rose and stood before the king. She said, “If it pleases the
      king, and if I have won his favor, and if the thing seems right before the king,
      and I have his approval, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised
      by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote giving orders to destroy
      the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king. '
    6: '⁶ For how can I bear to see the calamity that is coming on my people? Or how
      can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?” '
    7: '⁷ Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to the Jew Mordecai, “See,
      I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows,
      because he plotted to lay hands on the Jews. '
    8: "⁸ You may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the\
      \ king, and seal it with the king’s ring; for an edict written in the name of\
      \ the king and sealed with the king’s ring cannot be revoked.” \n"
    9: '⁹ The king’s secretaries were summoned at that time, in the third month, which
      is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and an edict was written, according
      to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors
      and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven
      provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own
      language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language. '
    10: '¹⁰ He wrote letters in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed them with the king’s
      ring, and sent them by mounted couriers riding on fast steeds bred from the
      royal herd. '
    11: '¹¹ By these letters the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble
      and defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force
      of any people or province that might attack them, with their children and women,
      and to plunder their goods '
    12: '¹² on a single day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the
      thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. '
    13: '¹³ A copy of the writ was to be issued as a decree in every province and
      published to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take
      revenge on their enemies. '
    14: "¹⁴ So the couriers, mounted on their swift royal steeds, hurried out, urged\
      \ by the king’s command. The decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king, wearing royal robes
      of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a mantle of fine linen and
      purple, while the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. '
    16: '¹⁶ For the Jews there was light and gladness, joy and honor. '
    17: ¹⁷ In every province and in every city, wherever the king’s command and his
      edict came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a festival and a holiday.
      Furthermore, many of the peoples of the country professed to be Jews, because
      the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth
      day, when the king’s command and edict were about to be executed, on the very
      day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain power over them, but which had
      been changed to a day when the Jews would gain power over their foes, '
    2: '² the Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus
      to lay hands on those who had sought their ruin; and no one could withstand
      them, because the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples. '
    3: '³ All the officials of the provinces, the satraps and the governors, and the
      royal officials were supporting the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen
      upon them. '
    4: '⁴ For Mordecai was powerful in the king’s house, and his fame spread throughout
      all the provinces as the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful. '
    5: '⁵ So the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, slaughtering,
      and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them. '
    6: '⁶ In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred people. '
    7: '⁷ They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, '
    8: '⁸ Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, '
    9: '⁹ Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, Vaizatha, '
    10: "¹⁰ the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they\
      \ did not touch the plunder. \n"
    11: '¹¹ That very day the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported
      to the king. '
    12: '¹² The king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed
      five hundred people and also the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the
      rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted
      you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled.” '
    13: '¹³ Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be
      allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day’s edict, and let the ten sons
      of Haman be hanged on the gallows.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the king commanded this to be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and
      the ten sons of Haman were hanged. '
    15: "¹⁵ The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month\
      \ of Adar and they killed three hundred persons in Susa; but they did not touch\
      \ the plunder. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces also gathered to defend
      their lives, and gained relief from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand
      of those who hated them; but they laid no hands on the plunder. '
    17: "¹⁷ This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth\
      \ day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the
      fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and
      gladness. '
    19: "¹⁹ Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns, hold the\
      \ fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting, a\
      \ holiday on which they send gifts of food to one another. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Mordecai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were
      in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, '
    21: '²¹ enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar
      and also the fifteenth day of the same month, year by year, '
    22: '²² as the days on which the Jews gained relief from their enemies, and as
      the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning
      into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days
      for sending gifts of food to one another and presents to the poor. '
    23: "²³ So the Jews adopted as a custom what they had begun to do, as Mordecai\
      \ had written to them. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted
      against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur—that is “the lot”—to crush
      and destroy them; '
    25: '²⁵ but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing that the
      wicked plot that he had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head,
      and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. '
    26: '²⁶ Therefore these days are called Purim, from the word Pur. Thus because
      of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter,
      and of what had happened to them, '
    27: '²⁷ the Jews established and accepted as a custom for themselves and their
      descendants and all who joined them, that without fail they would continue to
      observe these two days every year, as it was written and at the time appointed. '
    28: "²⁸ These days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation,\
      \ in every family, province, and city; and these days of Purim should never\
      \ fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days\
      \ cease among their descendants. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with the Jew Mordecai, gave full
      written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim. '
    30: '³⁰ Letters were sent wishing peace and security to all the Jews, to the one
      hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, '
    31: '³¹ and giving orders that these days of Purim should be observed at their
      appointed seasons, as the Jew Mordecai and Queen Esther enjoined on the Jews,
      just as they had laid down for themselves and for their descendants regulations
      concerning their fasts and their lamentations. '
    32: ³² The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it was
      recorded in writing.
  10:
    1: '¹ King Ahasuerus laid tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea. '
    2: '² All the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor
      of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the annals
      of the kings of Media and Persia? '
    3: ³ For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and he was powerful
      among the Jews and popular with his many kindred, for he sought the good of
      his people and interceded for the welfare of all his descendants.
