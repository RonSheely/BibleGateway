Zephaniah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah\
      \ son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of\
      \ Judah. \n"
    2: "² I will utterly sweep away everything\n    from the face of the earth, says\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ I will sweep away humans and animals;\n    I will sweep away the birds of\
      \ the air\n    and the fish of the sea.\nI will make the wicked stumble.\n \
      \   I will cut off humanity\n    from the face of the earth, says the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will stretch out my hand against Judah,\n    and against all the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem;\nand I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal\n\
      \    and the name of the idolatrous priests;\n"
    5: "⁵ those who bow down on the roofs\n    to the host of the heavens;\nthose\
      \ who bow down and swear to the Lord,\n    but also swear by Milcom;\n"
    6: "⁶ those who have turned back from following the Lord,\n    who have not sought\
      \ the Lord or inquired of him. \n"
    7: "⁷ Be silent before the Lord God!\n    For the day of the Lord is at hand;\n\
      the Lord has prepared a sacrifice,\n    he has consecrated his guests.\n"
    8: "⁸ And on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice\nI will punish the officials and\
      \ the king’s sons\n    and all who dress themselves in foreign attire.\n"
    9: "⁹ On that day I will punish\n    all who leap over the threshold,\nwho fill\
      \ their master’s house\n    with violence and fraud. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ On that day, says the Lord,\n    a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate,\n\
      a wail from the Second Quarter,\n    a loud crash from the hills.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The inhabitants of the Mortar wail,\n    for all the traders have perished;\n\
      \    all who weigh out silver are cut off.\n"
    12: "¹² At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps,\n    and I will punish\
      \ the people\nwho rest complacently on their dregs,\n    those who say in their\
      \ hearts,\n“The Lord will not do good,\n    nor will he do harm.”\n"
    13: "¹³ Their wealth shall be plundered,\n    and their houses laid waste.\nThough\
      \ they build houses,\n    they shall not inhabit them;\nthough they plant vineyards,\n\
      \    they shall not drink wine from them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The great day of the Lord is near,\n    near and hastening fast;\nthe\
      \ sound of the day of the Lord is bitter,\n    the warrior cries aloud there.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ That day will be a day of wrath,\n    a day of distress and anguish,\n\
      a day of ruin and devastation,\n    a day of darkness and gloom,\na day of clouds\
      \ and thick darkness,\n"
    16: "¹⁶     a day of trumpet blast and battle cry\nagainst the fortified cities\n\
      \    and against the lofty battlements. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I will bring such distress upon people\n    that they shall walk like\
      \ the blind;\n    because they have sinned against the Lord,\ntheir blood shall\
      \ be poured out like dust,\n    and their flesh like dung.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither their silver nor their gold\n    will be able to save them\n \
      \   on the day of the Lord’s wrath;\nin the fire of his passion\n    the whole\
      \ earth shall be consumed;\nfor a full, a terrible end\n    he will make of\
      \ all the inhabitants of the earth."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather together, gather,\n    O shameless nation,\n"
    2: "² before you are driven away\n    like the drifting chaff,\nbefore there comes\
      \ upon you\n    the fierce anger of the Lord,\nbefore there comes upon you\n\
      \    the day of the Lord’s wrath.\n"
    3: "³ Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land,\n    who do his commands;\nseek\
      \ righteousness, seek humility;\n    perhaps you may be hidden\n    on the day\
      \ of the Lord’s wrath.\n"
    4: "⁴ For Gaza shall be deserted,\n    and Ashkelon shall become a desolation;\n\
      Ashdod’s people shall be driven out at noon,\n    and Ekron shall be uprooted.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Ah, inhabitants of the seacoast,\n    you nation of the Cherethites!\nThe\
      \ word of the Lord is against you,\n    O Canaan, land of the Philistines;\n\
      \    and I will destroy you until no inhabitant is left.\n"
    6: "⁶ And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures,\n    meadows for shepherds\n   \
      \ and folds for flocks.\n"
    7: "⁷ The seacoast shall become the possession\n    of the remnant of the house\
      \ of Judah,\n    on which they shall pasture,\nand in the houses of Ashkelon\n\
      \    they shall lie down at evening.\nFor the Lord their God will be mindful\
      \ of them\n    and restore their fortunes. \n"
    8: "⁸ I have heard the taunts of Moab\n    and the revilings of the Ammonites,\n\
      how they have taunted my people\n    and made boasts against their territory.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts,\n    the God of Israel,\n\
      Moab shall become like Sodom\n    and the Ammonites like Gomorrah,\na land possessed\
      \ by nettles and salt pits,\n    and a waste forever.\nThe remnant of my people\
      \ shall plunder them,\n    and the survivors of my nation shall possess them.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ This shall be their lot in return for their pride,\n    because they scoffed\
      \ and boasted\n    against the people of the Lord of hosts.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will be terrible against them;\n    he will shrivel all the gods\
      \ of the earth,\nand to him shall bow down,\n    each in its place,\n    all\
      \ the coasts and islands of the nations. \n"
    12: "¹² You also, O Ethiopians,\n    shall be killed by my sword. \n"
    13: "¹³ And he will stretch out his hand against the north,\n    and destroy Assyria;\n\
      and he will make Nineveh a desolation,\n    a dry waste like the desert.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Herds shall lie down in it,\n    every wild animal;\nthe desert owl and\
      \ the screech owl\n    shall lodge on its capitals;\nthe owl shall hoot at the\
      \ window,\n    the raven croak on the threshold;\n    for its cedar work will\
      \ be laid bare.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Is this the exultant city\n    that lived secure,\nthat said to itself,\n\
      \    “I am, and there is no one else”?\nWhat a desolation it has become,\n \
      \   a lair for wild animals!\nEveryone who passes by it\n    hisses and shakes\
      \ the fist."
  3:
    1: "¹ Ah, soiled, defiled,\n    oppressing city!\n"
    2: "² It has listened to no voice;\n    it has accepted no correction.\nIt has\
      \ not trusted in the Lord;\n    it has not drawn near to its God. \n"
    3: "³ The officials within it\n    are roaring lions;\nits judges are evening\
      \ wolves\n    that leave nothing until the morning.\n"
    4: "⁴ Its prophets are reckless,\n    faithless persons;\nits priests have profaned\
      \ what is sacred,\n    they have done violence to the law.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord within it is righteous;\n    he does no wrong.\nEvery morning he\
      \ renders his judgment,\n    each dawn without fail;\n    but the unjust knows\
      \ no shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ I have cut off nations;\n    their battlements are in ruins;\nI have laid\
      \ waste their streets\n    so that no one walks in them;\ntheir cities have\
      \ been made desolate,\n    without people, without inhabitants.\n"
    7: "⁷ I said, “Surely the city will fear me,\n    it will accept correction;\n\
      it will not lose sight\n    of all that I have brought upon it.”\nBut they were\
      \ the more eager\n    to make all their deeds corrupt. \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore wait for me, says the Lord,\n    for the day when I arise as a\
      \ witness.\nFor my decision is to gather nations,\n    to assemble kingdoms,\n\
      to pour out upon them my indignation,\n    all the heat of my anger;\nfor in\
      \ the fire of my passion\n    all the earth shall be consumed. \n"
    9: "⁹ At that time I will change the speech of the peoples\n    to a pure speech,\n\
      that all of them may call on the name of the Lord\n    and serve him with one\
      \ accord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia\n    my suppliants, my scattered ones,\n\
      \    shall bring my offering. \n"
    11: "¹¹ On that day you shall not be put to shame\n    because of all the deeds\
      \ by which you have rebelled against me;\nfor then I will remove from your midst\n\
      \    your proudly exultant ones,\nand you shall no longer be haughty\n    in\
      \ my holy mountain.\n"
    12: "¹² For I will leave in the midst of you\n    a people humble and lowly.\n\
      They shall seek refuge in the name of the Lord—\n"
    13: "¹³     the remnant of Israel;\nthey shall do no wrong\n    and utter no lies,\n\
      nor shall a deceitful tongue\n    be found in their mouths.\nThen they will\
      \ pasture and lie down,\n    and no one shall make them afraid. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sing aloud, O daughter Zion;\n    shout, O Israel!\nRejoice and exult\
      \ with all your heart,\n    O daughter Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has taken away the judgments against you,\n    he has turned\
      \ away your enemies.\nThe king of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;\n    you\
      \ shall fear disaster no more.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:\nDo not fear, O Zion;\n   \
      \ do not let your hands grow weak.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord, your God, is in your midst,\n    a warrior who gives victory;\n\
      he will rejoice over you with gladness,\n    he will renew you in his love;\n\
      he will exult over you with loud singing\n"
    18: "¹⁸     as on a day of festival.\nI will remove disaster from you,\n    so\
      \ that you will not bear reproach for it.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will deal with all your oppressors\n    at that time.\nAnd I will save\
      \ the lame\n    and gather the outcast,\nand I will change their shame into\
      \ praise\n    and renown in all the earth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ At that time I will bring you home,\n    at the time when I gather you;\n\
      for I will make you renowned and praised\n    among all the peoples of the earth,\n\
      when I restore your fortunes\n    before your eyes, says the Lord."
