Leviticus:
  1:
    1: '¹ The Lord summoned Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying: '
    2: "² Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When any of you bring an\
      \ offering of livestock to the Lord, you shall bring your offering from the\
      \ herd or from the flock. \n"
    3: '³ If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you shall offer a male
      without blemish; you shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
      for acceptance in your behalf before the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ You shall lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall
      be acceptable in your behalf as atonement for you. '
    5: '⁵ The bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord; and Aaron’s sons the priests
      shall offer the blood, dashing the blood against all sides of the altar that
      is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ The burnt offering shall be flayed and cut up into its parts. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of the priest Aaron shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood
      on the fire. '
    8: '⁸ Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the parts, with the head and the
      suet, on the wood that is on the fire on the altar; '
    9: "⁹ but its entrails and its legs shall be washed with water. Then the priest\
      \ shall turn the whole into smoke on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering\
      \ by fire of pleasing odor to the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ If your gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or
      goats, your offering shall be a male without blemish. '
    11: '¹¹ It shall be slaughtered on the north side of the altar before the Lord,
      and Aaron’s sons the priests shall dash its blood against all sides of the altar. '
    12: '¹² It shall be cut up into its parts, with its head and its suet, and the
      priest shall arrange them on the wood that is on the fire on the altar; '
    13: "¹³ but the entrails and the legs shall be washed with water. Then the priest\
      \ shall offer the whole and turn it into smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering,\
      \ an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ If your offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, you shall choose
      your offering from turtledoves or pigeons. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head, and turn
      it into smoke on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out against the side
      of the altar. '
    16: '¹⁶ He shall remove its crop with its contents and throw it at the east side
      of the altar, in the place for ashes. '
    17: ¹⁷ He shall tear it open by its wings without severing it. Then the priest
      shall turn it into smoke on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire; it is
      a burnt offering, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the Lord.
  2:
    1: '¹ When anyone presents a grain offering to the Lord, the offering shall be
      of choice flour; the worshiper shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on
      it, '
    2: '² and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. After taking from it a handful
      of the choice flour and oil, with all its frankincense, the priest shall turn
      this token portion into smoke on the altar, an offering by fire of pleasing
      odor to the Lord. '
    3: "³ And what is left of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons,\
      \ a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ When you present a grain offering baked in the oven, it shall be of choice
      flour: unleavened cakes mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil. '
    5: '⁵ If your offering is grain prepared on a griddle, it shall be of choice flour
      mixed with oil, unleavened; '
    6: '⁶ break it in pieces, and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. '
    7: '⁷ If your offering is grain prepared in a pan, it shall be made of choice
      flour in oil. '
    8: '⁸ You shall bring to the Lord the grain offering that is prepared in any of
      these ways; and when it is presented to the priest, he shall take it to the
      altar. '
    9: '⁹ The priest shall remove from the grain offering its token portion and turn
      this into smoke on the altar, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ And what is left of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons;\
      \ it is a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ No grain offering that you bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven,
      for you must not turn any leaven or honey into smoke as an offering by fire
      to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² You may bring them to the Lord as an offering of choice products, but
      they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing odor. '
    13: "¹³ You shall not omit from your grain offerings the salt of the covenant\
      \ with your God; with all your offerings you shall offer salt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ If you bring a grain offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring
      as the grain offering of your first fruits coarse new grain from fresh ears,
      parched with fire. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall add oil to it and lay frankincense on it; it is a grain offering. '
    16: ¹⁶ And the priest shall turn a token portion of it into smoke—some of the
      coarse grain and oil with all its frankincense; it is an offering by fire to
      the Lord.
  3:
    1: '¹ If the offering is a sacrifice of well-being, if you offer an animal of
      the herd, whether male or female, you shall offer one without blemish before
      the Lord. '
    2: '² You shall lay your hand on the head of the offering and slaughter it at
      the entrance of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall dash
      the blood against all sides of the altar. '
    3: '³ You shall offer from the sacrifice of well-being, as an offering by fire
      to the Lord, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is around
      the entrails; '
    4: '⁴ the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage
      of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. '
    5: "⁵ Then Aaron’s sons shall turn these into smoke on the altar, with the burnt\
      \ offering that is on the wood on the fire, as an offering by fire of pleasing\
      \ odor to the Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ If your offering for a sacrifice of well-being to the Lord is from the flock,
      male or female, you shall offer one without blemish. '
    7: '⁷ If you present a sheep as your offering, you shall bring it before the Lord '
    8: '⁸ and lay your hand on the head of the offering. It shall be slaughtered before
      the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall dash its blood against all sides
      of the altar. '
    9: '⁹ You shall present its fat from the sacrifice of well-being, as an offering
      by fire to the Lord: the whole broad tail, which shall be removed close to the
      backbone, the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is around the
      entrails; '
    10: '¹⁰ the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage
      of the liver, which you shall remove with the kidneys. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the priest shall turn these into smoke on the altar as a food offering\
      \ by fire to the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² If your offering is a goat, you shall bring it before the Lord '
    13: '¹³ and lay your hand on its head; it shall be slaughtered before the tent
      of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall dash its blood against all sides of
      the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall present as your offering from it, as an offering by fire to
      the Lord, the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is around the
      entrails; '
    15: '¹⁵ the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage
      of the liver, which you shall remove with the kidneys. '
    16: "¹⁶ Then the priest shall turn these into smoke on the altar as a food offering\
      \ by fire for a pleasing odor.\nAll fat is the Lord’s. "
    17: '¹⁷ It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, in all your
      settlements: you must not eat any fat or any blood.'
  4:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² Speak to the people of Israel, saying: When anyone sins unintentionally\
      \ in any of the Lord’s commandments about things not to be done, and does any\
      \ one of them: \n"
    3: '³ If it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people,
      he shall offer for the sin that he has committed a bull of the herd without
      blemish as a sin offering to the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the
      Lord and lay his hand on the head of the bull; the bull shall be slaughtered
      before the Lord. '
    5: '⁵ The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it
      into the tent of meeting. '
    6: '⁶ The priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood
      seven times before the Lord in front of the curtain of the sanctuary. '
    7: '⁷ The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant
      incense that is in the tent of meeting before the Lord; and the rest of the
      blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering,
      which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. '
    8: '⁸ He shall remove all the fat from the bull of sin offering: the fat that
      covers the entrails and all the fat that is around the entrails; '
    9: '⁹ the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins; and the appendage
      of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys, '
    10: '¹⁰ just as these are removed from the ox of the sacrifice of well-being.
      The priest shall turn them into smoke upon the altar of burnt offering. '
    11: '¹¹ But the skin of the bull and all its flesh, as well as its head, its legs,
      its entrails, and its dung— '
    12: "¹² all the rest of the bull—he shall carry out to a clean place outside the\
      \ camp, to the ash heap, and shall burn it on a wood fire; at the ash heap it\
      \ shall be burned. \n"
    13: '¹³ If the whole congregation of Israel errs unintentionally and the matter
      escapes the notice of the assembly, and they do any one of the things that by
      the Lord’s commandments ought not to be done and incur guilt; '
    14: '¹⁴ when the sin that they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall
      offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of
      meeting. '
    15: '¹⁵ The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the
      bull before the Lord, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ The anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the
      tent of meeting, '
    17: '¹⁷ and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven
      times before the Lord, in front of the curtain. '
    18: '¹⁸ He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before
      the Lord in the tent of meeting; and the rest of the blood he shall pour out
      at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent
      of meeting. '
    19: '¹⁹ He shall remove all its fat and turn it into smoke on the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ He shall do with the bull just as is done with the bull of sin offering;
      he shall do the same with this. The priest shall make atonement for them, and
      they shall be forgiven. '
    21: "²¹ He shall carry the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the\
      \ first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly. \n"
    22: '²² When a ruler sins, doing unintentionally any one of all the things that
      by commandments of the Lord his God ought not to be done and incurs guilt, '
    23: '²³ once the sin that he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring
      as his offering a male goat without blemish. '
    24: '²⁴ He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat; it shall be slaughtered
      at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the Lord; it is a
      sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger
      and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest
      of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. '
    26: "²⁶ All its fat he shall turn into smoke on the altar, like the fat of the\
      \ sacrifice of well-being. Thus the priest shall make atonement on his behalf\
      \ for his sin, and he shall be forgiven. \n"
    27: '²⁷ If anyone of the ordinary people among you sins unintentionally in doing
      any one of the things that by the Lord’s commandments ought not to be done and
      incurs guilt, '
    28: '²⁸ when the sin that you have committed is made known to you, you shall bring
      a female goat without blemish as your offering, for the sin that you have committed. '
    29: '²⁹ You shall lay your hand on the head of the sin offering; and the sin offering
      shall be slaughtered at the place of the burnt offering. '
    30: '³⁰ The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on
      the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he shall pour out the rest of
      its blood at the base of the altar. '
    31: "³¹ He shall remove all its fat, as the fat is removed from the offering of\
      \ well-being, and the priest shall turn it into smoke on the altar for a pleasing\
      \ odor to the Lord. Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf, and\
      \ you shall be forgiven. \n"
    32: '³² If the offering you bring as a sin offering is a sheep, you shall bring
      a female without blemish. '
    33: '³³ You shall lay your hand on the head of the sin offering; and it shall
      be slaughtered as a sin offering at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered. '
    34: '³⁴ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger
      and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest
      of its blood at the base of the altar. '
    35: ³⁵ You shall remove all its fat, as the fat of the sheep is removed from the
      sacrifice of well-being, and the priest shall turn it into smoke on the altar,
      with the offerings by fire to the Lord. Thus the priest shall make atonement
      on your behalf for the sin that you have committed, and you shall be forgiven.
  5:
    1: '¹ When any of you sin in that you have heard a public adjuration to testify
      and—though able to testify as one who has seen or learned of the matter—do not
      speak up, you are subject to punishment. '
    2: '² Or when any of you touch any unclean thing—whether the carcass of an unclean
      beast or the carcass of unclean livestock or the carcass of an unclean swarming
      thing—and are unaware of it, you have become unclean, and are guilty. '
    3: '³ Or when you touch human uncleanness—any uncleanness by which one can become
      unclean—and are unaware of it, when you come to know it, you shall be guilty. '
    4: '⁴ Or when any of you utter aloud a rash oath for a bad or a good purpose,
      whatever people utter in an oath, and are unaware of it, when you come to know
      it, you shall in any of these be guilty. '
    5: '⁵ When you realize your guilt in any of these, you shall confess the sin that
      you have committed. '
    6: "⁶ And you shall bring to the Lord, as your penalty for the sin that you have\
      \ committed, a female from the flock, a sheep or a goat, as a sin offering;\
      \ and the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for your sin. \n"
    7: '⁷ But if you cannot afford a sheep, you shall bring to the Lord, as your penalty
      for the sin that you have committed, two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for
      a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. '
    8: '⁸ You shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the
      sin offering, wringing its head at the nape without severing it. '
    9: '⁹ He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the
      altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar;
      it is a sin offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ And the second he shall offer for a burnt offering according to the regulation.\
      \ Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for the sin that you have\
      \ committed, and you shall be forgiven. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But if you cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, you shall bring
      as your offering for the sin that you have committed one-tenth of an ephah of
      choice flour for a sin offering; you shall not put oil on it or lay frankincense
      on it, for it is a sin offering. '
    12: '¹² You shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall scoop up a handful
      of it as its memorial portion, and turn this into smoke on the altar, with the
      offerings by fire to the Lord; it is a sin offering. '
    13: "¹³ Thus the priest shall make atonement on your behalf for whichever of these\
      \ sins you have committed, and you shall be forgiven. Like the grain offering,\
      \ the rest shall be for the priest. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    15: '¹⁵ When any of you commit a trespass and sin unintentionally in any of the
      holy things of the Lord, you shall bring, as your guilt offering to the Lord,
      a ram without blemish from the flock, convertible into silver by the sanctuary
      shekel; it is a guilt offering. '
    16: "¹⁶ And you shall make restitution for the holy thing in which you were remiss,\
      \ and shall add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest. The priest shall\
      \ make atonement on your behalf with the ram of the guilt offering, and you\
      \ shall be forgiven. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ If any of you sin without knowing it, doing any of the things that by
      the Lord’s commandments ought not to be done, you have incurred guilt, and are
      subject to punishment. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, or
      the equivalent, as a guilt offering; and the priest shall make atonement on
      your behalf for the error that you committed unintentionally, and you shall
      be forgiven. '
    19: ¹⁹ It is a guilt offering; you have incurred guilt before the Lord.
  6:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² When any of you sin and commit a trespass against the Lord by deceiving
      a neighbor in a matter of a deposit or a pledge, or by robbery, or if you have
      defrauded a neighbor, '
    3: '³ or have found something lost and lied about it—if you swear falsely regarding
      any of the various things that one may do and sin thereby— '
    4: '⁴ when you have sinned and realize your guilt, and would restore what you
      took by robbery or by fraud or the deposit that was committed to you, or the
      lost thing that you found, '
    5: '⁵ or anything else about which you have sworn falsely, you shall repay the
      principal amount and shall add one-fifth to it. You shall pay it to its owner
      when you realize your guilt. '
    6: '⁶ And you shall bring to the priest, as your guilt offering to the Lord, a
      ram without blemish from the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering. '
    7: "⁷ The priest shall make atonement on your behalf before the Lord, and you\
      \ shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and incur guilt thereby.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    9: '⁹ Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the ritual of the burnt offering.
      The burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth upon the altar all night
      until the morning, while the fire on the altar shall be kept burning. '
    10: '¹⁰ The priest shall put on his linen vestments after putting on his linen
      undergarments next to his body; and he shall take up the ashes to which the
      fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar, and place them beside the
      altar. '
    11: '¹¹ Then he shall take off his vestments and put on other garments, and carry
      the ashes out to a clean place outside the camp. '
    12: '¹² The fire on the altar shall be kept burning; it shall not go out. Every
      morning the priest shall add wood to it, lay out the burnt offering on it, and
      turn into smoke the fat pieces of the offerings of well-being. '
    13: "¹³ A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar; it shall not go out.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ This is the ritual of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer
      it before the Lord, in front of the altar. '
    15: '¹⁵ They shall take from it a handful of the choice flour and oil of the grain
      offering, with all the frankincense that is on the offering, and they shall
      turn its memorial portion into smoke on the altar as a pleasing odor to the
      Lord. '
    16: '¹⁶ Aaron and his sons shall eat what is left of it; it shall be eaten as
      unleavened cakes in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall
      eat it. '
    17: '¹⁷ It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of
      my offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. '
    18: "¹⁸ Every male among the descendants of Aaron shall eat of it, as their perpetual\
      \ due throughout your generations, from the Lord’s offerings by fire; anything\
      \ that touches them shall become holy. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    20: '²⁰ This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the Lord on
      the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ephah of choice flour as a regular
      offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening. '
    21: '²¹ It shall be made with oil on a griddle; you shall bring it well soaked,
      as a grain offering of baked pieces, and you shall present it as a pleasing
      odor to the Lord. '
    22: '²² And so the priest, anointed from among Aaron’s descendants as a successor,
      shall prepare it; it is the Lord’s—a perpetual due—to be turned entirely into
      smoke. '
    23: "²³ Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned; it shall not\
      \ be eaten. \n"
    24: '²⁴ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    25: '²⁵ Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the ritual of the sin offering.
      The sin offering shall be slaughtered before the Lord at the spot where the
      burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest who offers it as a sin offering shall eat of it; it shall be
      eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting. '
    27: '²⁷ Whatever touches its flesh shall become holy; and when any of its blood
      is spattered on a garment, you shall wash the bespattered part in a holy place. '
    28: '²⁸ An earthen vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; but if it is
      boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water. '
    29: '²⁹ Every male among the priests shall eat of it; it is most holy. '
    30: ³⁰ But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into
      the tent of meeting for atonement in the holy place; it shall be burned with
      fire.
  7:
    1: '¹ This is the ritual of the guilt offering. It is most holy; '
    2: '² at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughtered, they shall slaughter
      the guilt offering, and its blood shall be dashed against all sides of the altar. '
    3: '³ All its fat shall be offered: the broad tail, the fat that covers the entrails, '
    4: '⁴ the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage
      of the liver, which shall be removed with the kidneys. '
    5: '⁵ The priest shall turn them into smoke on the altar as an offering by fire
      to the Lord; it is a guilt offering. '
    6: "⁶ Every male among the priests shall eat of it; it shall be eaten in a holy\
      \ place; it is most holy. \n"
    7: '⁷ The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is the same ritual for
      them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. '
    8: '⁸ So, too, the priest who offers anyone’s burnt offering shall keep the skin
      of the burnt offering that he has offered. '
    9: '⁹ And every grain offering baked in the oven, and all that is prepared in
      a pan or on a griddle, shall belong to the priest who offers it. '
    10: "¹⁰ But every other grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to\
      \ all the sons of Aaron equally. \n"
    11: '¹¹ This is the ritual of the sacrifice of the offering of well-being that
      one may offer to the Lord. '
    12: '¹² If you offer it for thanksgiving, you shall offer with the thank offering
      unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes
      of choice flour well soaked in oil. '
    13: '¹³ With your thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being you shall bring your offering
      with cakes of leavened bread. '
    14: '¹⁴ From this you shall offer one cake from each offering, as a gift to the
      Lord; it shall belong to the priest who dashes the blood of the offering of
      well-being. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the flesh of your thanksgiving sacrifice of well-being shall be eaten
      on the day it is offered; you shall not leave any of it until morning. '
    16: '¹⁶ But if the sacrifice you offer is a votive offering or a freewill offering,
      it shall be eaten on the day that you offer your sacrifice, and what is left
      of it shall be eaten the next day; '
    17: '¹⁷ but what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice shall be burned up on the
      third day. '
    18: "¹⁸ If any of the flesh of your sacrifice of well-being is eaten on the third\
      \ day, it shall not be acceptable, nor shall it be credited to the one who offers\
      \ it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall incur guilt.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned
      up. As for other flesh, all who are clean may eat such flesh. '
    20: '²⁰ But those who eat flesh from the Lord’s sacrifice of well-being while
      in a state of uncleanness shall be cut off from their kin. '
    21: "²¹ When any one of you touches any unclean thing—human uncleanness or an\
      \ unclean animal or any unclean creature—and then eats flesh from the Lord’s\
      \ sacrifice of well-being, you shall be cut off from your kin. \n"
    22: '²² The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    23: '²³ Speak to the people of Israel, saying: You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep
      or goat. '
    24: '²⁴ The fat of an animal that died or was torn by wild animals may be put
      to any other use, but you must not eat it. '
    25: '²⁵ If any one of you eats the fat from an animal of which an offering by
      fire may be made to the Lord, you who eat it shall be cut off from your kin. '
    26: '²⁶ You must not eat any blood whatever, either of bird or of animal, in any
      of your settlements. '
    27: "²⁷ Any one of you who eats any blood shall be cut off from your kin. \n"
    28: '²⁸ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    29: '²⁹ Speak to the people of Israel, saying: Any one of you who would offer
      to the Lord your sacrifice of well-being must yourself bring to the Lord your
      offering from your sacrifice of well-being. '
    30: '³⁰ Your own hands shall bring the Lord’s offering by fire; you shall bring
      the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be raised as an elevation offering
      before the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ The priest shall turn the fat into smoke on the altar, but the breast
      shall belong to Aaron and his sons. '
    32: '³² And the right thigh from your sacrifices of well-being you shall give
      to the priest as an offering; '
    33: '³³ the one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood and fat of the offering
      of well-being shall have the right thigh for a portion. '
    34: '³⁴ For I have taken the breast of the elevation offering, and the thigh that
      is offered, from the people of Israel, from their sacrifices of well-being,
      and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due
      from the people of Israel. '
    35: '³⁵ This is the portion allotted to Aaron and to his sons from the offerings
      made by fire to the Lord, once they have been brought forward to serve the Lord
      as priests; '
    36: "³⁶ these the Lord commanded to be given them, when he anointed them, as a\
      \ perpetual due from the people of Israel throughout their generations. \n"
    37: '³⁷ This is the ritual of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin
      offering, the guilt offering, the offering of ordination, and the sacrifice
      of well-being, '
    38: ³⁸ which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, when he commanded the people
      of Israel to bring their offerings to the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.
  8:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² Take Aaron and his sons with him, the vestments, the anointing oil, the
      bull of sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; '
    3: '³ and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting. '
    4: '⁴ And Moses did as the Lord commanded him. When the congregation was assembled
      at the entrance of the tent of meeting, '
    5: "⁵ Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the Lord has commanded to\
      \ be done.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward, and washed them with water. '
    7: '⁷ He put the tunic on him, fastened the sash around him, clothed him with
      the robe, and put the ephod on him. He then put the decorated band of the ephod
      around him, tying the ephod to him with it. '
    8: '⁸ He placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim
      and the Thummim. '
    9: "⁹ And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the\
      \ golden ornament, the holy crown, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all
      that was in it, and consecrated them. '
    11: '¹¹ He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar
      and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to consecrate them. '
    12: '¹² He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him,
      to consecrate him. '
    13: "¹³ And Moses brought forward Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics,\
      \ and fastened sashes around them, and tied headdresses on them, as the Lord\
      \ commanded Moses. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He led forward the bull of sin offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their
      hands upon the head of the bull of sin offering, '
    15: '¹⁵ and it was slaughtered. Moses took the blood and with his finger put some
      on each of the horns of the altar, purifying the altar; then he poured out the
      blood at the base of the altar. Thus he consecrated it, to make atonement for
      it. '
    16: '¹⁶ Moses took all the fat that was around the entrails, and the appendage
      of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and turned them into smoke
      on the altar. '
    17: "¹⁷ But the bull itself, its skin and flesh and its dung, he burned with fire\
      \ outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then he brought forward the ram of burnt offering. Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the head of the ram, '
    19: '¹⁹ and it was slaughtered. Moses dashed the blood against all sides of the
      altar. '
    20: '²⁰ The ram was cut into its parts, and Moses turned into smoke the head and
      the parts and the suet. '
    21: "²¹ And after the entrails and the legs were washed with water, Moses turned\
      \ into smoke the whole ram on the altar; it was a burnt offering for a pleasing\
      \ odor, an offering by fire to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. \n"
    22: '²² Then he brought forward the second ram, the ram of ordination. Aaron and
      his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, '
    23: '²³ and it was slaughtered. Moses took some of its blood and put it on the
      lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big
      toe of his right foot. '
    24: '²⁴ After Aaron’s sons were brought forward, Moses put some of the blood on
      the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on
      the big toes of their right feet; and Moses dashed the rest of the blood against
      all sides of the altar. '
    25: '²⁵ He took the fat—the broad tail, all the fat that was around the entrails,
      the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat—and the right
      thigh. '
    26: '²⁶ From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took
      one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread with oil, and one wafer, and
      placed them on the fat and on the right thigh. '
    27: '²⁷ He placed all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons,
      and raised them as an elevation offering before the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ Then Moses took them from their hands and turned them into smoke on the
      altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering for a pleasing
      odor, an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ Moses took the breast and raised it as an elevation offering before the\
      \ Lord; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, as the Lord commanded\
      \ Moses. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was\
      \ on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his vestments, and also on his\
      \ sons and their vestments. Thus he consecrated Aaron and his vestments, and\
      \ also his sons and their vestments. \n"
    31: '³¹ And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance
      of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket
      of ordination offerings, as I was commanded, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it’; '
    32: '³² and what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire. '
    33: '³³ You shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven
      days, until the day when your period of ordination is completed. For it will
      take seven days to ordain you; '
    34: '³⁴ as has been done today, the Lord has commanded to be done to make atonement
      for you. '
    35: '³⁵ You shall remain at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night
      for seven days, keeping the Lord’s charge so that you do not die; for so I am
      commanded.” '
    36: ³⁶ Aaron and his sons did all the things that the Lord commanded through Moses.
  9:
    1: '¹ On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. '
    2: '² He said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt
      offering, without blemish, and offer them before the Lord. '
    3: '³ And say to the people of Israel, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; a
      calf and a lamb, yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering; '
    4: '⁴ and an ox and a ram for an offering of well-being to sacrifice before the
      Lord; and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the Lord will appear to
      you.’” '
    5: '⁵ They brought what Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting; and
      the whole congregation drew near and stood before the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ And Moses said, “This is the thing that the Lord commanded you to do, so
      that the glory of the Lord may appear to you.” '
    7: "⁷ Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and sacrifice your sin\
      \ offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for\
      \ the people; and sacrifice the offering of the people, and make atonement for\
      \ them; as the Lord has commanded.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Aaron drew near to the altar, and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering,
      which was for himself. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in
      the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; and the rest of the blood he
      poured out at the base of the altar. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the fat, the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver from the sin
      offering he turned into smoke on the altar, as the Lord commanded Moses; '
    11: "¹¹ and the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp. \n"
    12: '¹² Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron’s sons brought him the blood,
      and he dashed it against all sides of the altar. '
    13: '¹³ And they brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, and the head,
      which he turned into smoke on the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ He washed the entrails and the legs and, with the burnt offering, turned\
      \ them into smoke on the altar. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Next he presented the people’s offering. He took the goat of the sin offering
      that was for the people, and slaughtered it, and presented it as a sin offering
      like the first one. '
    16: '¹⁶ He presented the burnt offering, and sacrificed it according to regulation. '
    17: "¹⁷ He presented the grain offering, and, taking a handful of it, he turned\
      \ it into smoke on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He slaughtered the ox and the ram as a sacrifice of well-being for the
      people. Aaron’s sons brought him the blood, which he dashed against all sides
      of the altar, '
    19: '¹⁹ and the fat of the ox and of the ram—the broad tail, the fat that covers
      the entrails, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the appendage of the
      liver. '
    20: '²⁰ They first laid the fat on the breasts, and the fat was turned into smoke
      on the altar; '
    21: "²¹ and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron raised as an elevation offering\
      \ before the Lord, as Moses had commanded. \n"
    22: '²² Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came
      down after sacrificing the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the offering
      of well-being. '
    23: '²³ Moses and Aaron entered the tent of meeting, and then came out and blessed
      the people; and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. '
    24: ²⁴ Fire came out from the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat
      on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their
      faces.
  10:
    1: '¹ Now Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer, put fire in it,
      and laid incense on it; and they offered unholy fire before the Lord, such as
      he had not commanded them. '
    2: '² And fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they
      died before the Lord. '
    3: "³ Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord meant when he said,\n‘Through\
      \ those who are near me\n    I will show myself holy,\nand before all the people\n\
      \    I will be glorified.’”\nAnd Aaron was silent. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron,
      and said to them, “Come forward, and carry your kinsmen away from the front
      of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.” '
    5: '⁵ They came forward and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses
      had ordered. '
    6: '⁶ And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not dishevel
      your hair, and do not tear your vestments, or you will die and wrath will strike
      all the congregation; but your kindred, the whole house of Israel, may mourn
      the burning that the Lord has sent. '
    7: "⁷ You shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will\
      \ die; for the anointing oil of the Lord is on you.” And they did as Moses had\
      \ ordered. \n"
    8: '⁸ And the Lord spoke to Aaron: '
    9: '⁹ Drink no wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons, when you enter
      the tent of meeting, that you may not die; it is a statute forever throughout
      your generations. '
    10: '¹⁰ You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the
      unclean and the clean; '
    11: "¹¹ and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the Lord\
      \ has spoken to them through Moses. \n"
    12: '¹² Moses spoke to Aaron and to his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: Take
      the grain offering that is left from the Lord’s offerings by fire, and eat it
      unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy; '
    13: '¹³ you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’
      due, from the offerings by fire to the Lord; for so I am commanded. '
    14: '¹⁴ But the breast that is elevated and the thigh that is raised, you and
      your sons and daughters as well may eat in any clean place; for they have been
      assigned to you and your children from the sacrifices of the offerings of well-being
      of the people of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ The thigh that is raised and the breast that is elevated they shall bring,\
      \ together with the offerings by fire of the fat, to raise for an elevation\
      \ offering before the Lord; they are to be your due and that of your children\
      \ forever, as the Lord has commanded. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Moses made inquiry about the goat of the sin offering, and—it had
      already been burned! He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining
      sons, and said, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sacred area? For it is most
      holy, and God has given it to you that you may remove the guilt of the congregation,
      to make atonement on their behalf before the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ Its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You should
      certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.” '
    19: '¹⁹ And Aaron spoke to Moses, “See, today they offered their sin offering
      and their burnt offering before the Lord; and yet such things as these have
      befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been agreeable
      to the Lord?” '
    20: ²⁰ And when Moses heard that, he agreed.
  11:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them: '
    2: "² Speak to the people of Israel, saying:\nFrom among all the land animals,\
      \ these are the creatures that you may eat. "
    3: '³ Any animal that has divided hoofs and is cleft-footed and chews the cud—such
      you may eat. '
    4: '⁴ But among those that chew the cud or have divided hoofs, you shall not eat
      the following: the camel, for even though it chews the cud, it does not have
      divided hoofs; it is unclean for you. '
    5: '⁵ The rock badger, for even though it chews the cud, it does not have divided
      hoofs; it is unclean for you. '
    6: '⁶ The hare, for even though it chews the cud, it does not have divided hoofs;
      it is unclean for you. '
    7: '⁷ The pig, for even though it has divided hoofs and is cleft-footed, it does
      not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. '
    8: "⁸ Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch;\
      \ they are unclean for you. \n"
    9: '⁹ These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters
      that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams—such you may
      eat. '
    10: '¹⁰ But anything in the seas or the streams that does not have fins and scales,
      of the swarming creatures in the waters and among all the other living creatures
      that are in the waters—they are detestable to you '
    11: '¹¹ and detestable they shall remain. Of their flesh you shall not eat, and
      their carcasses you shall regard as detestable. '
    12: "¹² Everything in the waters that does not have fins and scales is detestable\
      \ to you. \n"
    13: '¹³ These you shall regard as detestable among the birds. They shall not be
      eaten; they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey, '
    14: '¹⁴ the buzzard, the kite of any kind; '
    15: '¹⁵ every raven of any kind; '
    16: '¹⁶ the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the hawk of any kind; '
    17: '¹⁷ the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, '
    18: '¹⁸ the water hen, the desert owl, the carrion vulture, '
    19: "¹⁹ the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. \n"
    20: '²⁰ All winged insects that walk upon all fours are detestable to you. '
    21: '²¹ But among the winged insects that walk on all fours you may eat those
      that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to leap on the ground. '
    22: '²² Of them you may eat: the locust according to its kind, the bald locust
      according to its kind, the cricket according to its kind, and the grasshopper
      according to its kind. '
    23: "²³ But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of any
      of them shall be unclean until the evening, '
    25: '²⁵ and whoever carries any part of the carcass of any of them shall wash
      his clothes and be unclean until the evening. '
    26: '²⁶ Every animal that has divided hoofs but is not cleft-footed or does not
      chew the cud is unclean for you; everyone who touches one of them shall be unclean. '
    27: '²⁷ All that walk on their paws, among the animals that walk on all fours,
      are unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them shall be unclean
      until the evening, '
    28: "²⁸ and the one who carries the carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean\
      \ until the evening; they are unclean for you. \n"
    29: '²⁹ These are unclean for you among the creatures that swarm upon the earth:
      the weasel, the mouse, the great lizard according to its kind, '
    30: '³⁰ the gecko, the land crocodile, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. '
    31: '³¹ These are unclean for you among all that swarm; whoever touches one of
      them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening. '
    32: '³² And anything upon which any of them falls when they are dead shall be
      unclean, whether an article of wood or cloth or skin or sacking, any article
      that is used for any purpose; it shall be dipped into water, and it shall be
      unclean until the evening, and then it shall be clean. '
    33: '³³ And if any of them falls into any earthen vessel, all that is in it shall
      be unclean, and you shall break the vessel. '
    34: '³⁴ Any food that could be eaten shall be unclean if water from any such vessel
      comes upon it; and any liquid that could be drunk shall be unclean if it was
      in any such vessel. '
    35: '³⁵ Everything on which any part of the carcass falls shall be unclean; whether
      an oven or stove, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall
      remain unclean for you. '
    36: '³⁶ But a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean, while whatever
      touches the carcass in it shall be unclean. '
    37: '³⁷ If any part of their carcass falls upon any seed set aside for sowing,
      it is clean; '
    38: "³⁸ but if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on\
      \ it, it is unclean for you. \n"
    39: '³⁹ If an animal of which you may eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass
      shall be unclean until the evening. '
    40: "⁴⁰ Those who eat of its carcass shall wash their clothes and be unclean until\
      \ the evening; and those who carry the carcass shall wash their clothes and\
      \ be unclean until the evening. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ All creatures that swarm upon the earth are detestable; they shall not
      be eaten. '
    42: '⁴² Whatever moves on its belly, and whatever moves on all fours, or whatever
      has many feet, all the creatures that swarm upon the earth, you shall not eat;
      for they are detestable. '
    43: '⁴³ You shall not make yourselves detestable with any creature that swarms;
      you shall not defile yourselves with them, and so become unclean. '
    44: '⁴⁴ For I am the Lord your God; sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy,
      for I am holy. You shall not defile yourselves with any swarming creature that
      moves on the earth. '
    45: "⁴⁵ For I am the Lord who brought you up from the land of Egypt, to be your\
      \ God; you shall be holy, for I am holy. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ This is the law pertaining to land animal and bird and every living creature
      that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms upon the earth, '
    47: ⁴⁷ to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the
      living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.

      \ male child, she shall be ceremonially unclean seven days; as at the time of\
      \ her menstruation, she shall be unclean. "
    3: '³ On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. '
    4: '⁴ Her time of blood purification shall be thirty-three days; she shall not
      touch any holy thing, or come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification
      are completed. '
    5: "⁵ If she bears a female child, she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation;\
      \ her time of blood purification shall be sixty-six days. \n"
    6: '⁶ When the days of her purification are completed, whether for a son or for
      a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting
      a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove
      for a sin offering. '
    7: '⁷ He shall offer it before the Lord, and make atonement on her behalf; then
      she shall be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law for her who bears
      a child, male or female. '
    8: ⁸ If she cannot afford a sheep, she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons,
      one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall
      make atonement on her behalf, and she shall be clean.
  13:
    1: "¹ The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: \n"
    2: '² When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a
      spot, and it turns into a leprous disease on the skin of his body, he shall
      be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests. '
    3: '³ The priest shall examine the disease on the skin of his body, and if the
      hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper
      than the skin of his body, it is a leprous disease; after the priest has examined
      him he shall pronounce him ceremonially unclean. '
    4: '⁴ But if the spot is white in the skin of his body, and appears no deeper
      than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall confine
      the diseased person for seven days. '
    5: '⁵ The priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if he sees that the
      disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest
      shall confine him seven days more. '
    6: '⁶ The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the disease
      has abated and the disease has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce
      him clean; it is only an eruption; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. '
    7: '⁷ But if the eruption spreads in the skin after he has shown himself to the
      priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest. '
    8: "⁸ The priest shall make an examination, and if the eruption has spread in\
      \ the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ When a person contracts a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest. '
    10: '¹⁰ The priest shall make an examination, and if there is a white swelling
      in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in
      the swelling, '
    11: '¹¹ it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body. The priest shall
      pronounce him unclean; he shall not confine him, for he is unclean. '
    12: '¹² But if the disease breaks out in the skin, so that it covers all the skin
      of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see, '
    13: '¹³ then the priest shall make an examination, and if the disease has covered
      all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; since it has all
      turned white, he is clean. '
    14: '¹⁴ But if raw flesh ever appears on him, he shall be unclean; '
    15: '¹⁵ the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw
      flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease. '
    16: '¹⁶ But if the raw flesh again turns white, he shall come to the priest; '
    17: "¹⁷ the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, the\

    18: '¹⁸ When there is on the skin of one’s body a boil that has healed, '
    19: '¹⁹ and in the place of the boil there appears a white swelling or a reddish-white
      spot, it shall be shown to the priest. '
    20: '²⁰ The priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the
      skin and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean;
      this is a leprous disease, broken out in the boil. '
    21: '²¹ But if the priest examines it and the hair on it is not white, nor is
      it deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven days. '
    22: '²² If it spreads in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it
      is diseased. '
    23: "²³ But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar\
      \ of the boil; the priest shall pronounce him clean. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Or, when the body has a burn on the skin and the raw flesh of the burn
      becomes a spot, reddish-white or white, '
    25: '²⁵ the priest shall examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white
      and it appears deeper than the skin, it is a leprous disease; it has broken
      out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous
      disease. '
    26: '²⁶ But if the priest examines it and the hair in the spot is not white, and
      it is no deeper than the skin but has abated, the priest shall confine him seven
      days. '
    27: '²⁷ The priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the
      skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. This is a leprous disease. '
    28: "²⁸ But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin but\
      \ has abated, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce\
      \ him clean; for it is the scar of the burn. \n"
    29: '²⁹ When a man or woman has a disease on the head or in the beard, '
    30: '³⁰ the priest shall examine the disease. If it appears deeper than the skin
      and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean;
      it is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard. '
    31: '³¹ If the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than
      the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall confine the person
      with the itching disease for seven days. '
    32: '³² On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has
      not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the itch appears to be no
      deeper than the skin, '
    33: '³³ he shall shave, but the itch he shall not shave. The priest shall confine
      the person with the itch for seven days more. '
    34: '³⁴ On the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch; if the itch has
      not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest
      shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean. '
    35: '³⁵ But if the itch spreads in the skin after he was pronounced clean, '
    36: '³⁶ the priest shall examine him. If the itch has spread in the skin, the
      priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean. '
    37: "³⁷ But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it,\
      \ the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\
      \ \n"
    38: '³⁸ When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots, '
    39: "³⁹ the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of\
      \ the body are of a dull white, it is a rash that has broken out on the skin;\
      \ he is clean. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ If anyone loses the hair from his head, he is bald but he is clean. '
    41: '⁴¹ If he loses the hair from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of
      the forehead but he is clean. '
    42: '⁴² But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white
      diseased spot, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his
      bald forehead. '
    43: '⁴³ The priest shall examine him; if the diseased swelling is reddish-white
      on his bald head or on his bald forehead, which resembles a leprous disease
      in the skin of the body, '
    44: "⁴⁴ he is leprous, he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean;\
      \ the disease is on his head. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ The person who has the leprous disease shall wear torn clothes and let
      the hair of his head be disheveled; and he shall cover his upper lip and cry
      out, “Unclean, unclean.” '
    46: "⁴⁶ He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean.\
      \ He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ Concerning clothing: when a leprous disease appears in it, in woolen or
      linen cloth, '
    48: '⁴⁸ in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of
      skin, '
    49: '⁴⁹ if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp
      or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and
      shall be shown to the priest. '
    50: '⁵⁰ The priest shall examine the disease, and put the diseased article aside
      for seven days. '
    51: '⁵¹ He shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread
      in the cloth, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin,
      this is a spreading leprous disease; it is unclean. '
    52: "⁵² He shall burn the clothing, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or\
      \ linen, or anything of skin, for it is a spreading leprous disease; it shall\
      \ be burned in fire. \n"
    53: '⁵³ If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in
      the clothing, in warp or woof or in anything of skin, '
    54: '⁵⁴ the priest shall command them to wash the article in which the disease
      appears, and he shall put it aside seven days more. '
    55: "⁵⁵ The priest shall examine the diseased article after it has been washed.\
      \ If the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread,\
      \ it is unclean; you shall burn it in fire, whether the leprous spot is on the\
      \ inside or on the outside. \n"
    56: '⁵⁶ If the priest makes an examination, and the disease has abated after it
      is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the cloth, in warp or woof, or out
      of skin. '
    57: '⁵⁷ If it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of
      skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which the disease appears. '
    58: "⁵⁸ But the cloth, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease\
      \ disappears when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and\
      \ it shall be clean. \n"
    59: ⁵⁹ This is the ritual for a leprous disease in a cloth of wool or linen, either
      in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.
  14:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: "² This shall be the ritual for the leprous person at the time of his cleansing:\n\
      He shall be brought to the priest; "
    3: '³ the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make an examination.
      If the disease is healed in the leprous person, '
    4: '⁴ the priest shall command that two living clean birds and cedarwood and crimson
      yarn and hyssop be brought for the one who is to be cleansed. '
    5: '⁵ The priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered over fresh
      water in an earthen vessel. '
    6: '⁶ He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the crimson yarn and
      the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was
      slaughtered over the fresh water. '
    7: '⁷ He shall sprinkle it seven times upon the one who is to be cleansed of the
      leprous disease; then he shall pronounce him clean, and he shall let the living
      bird go into the open field. '
    8: '⁸ The one who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all
      his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. After that he shall
      come into the camp, but shall live outside his tent seven days. '
    9: "⁹ On the seventh day he shall shave all his hair: of head, beard, eyebrows;\
      \ he shall shave all his hair. Then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe his\
      \ body in water, and he shall be clean. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one
      ewe lamb in its first year without blemish, and a grain offering of three-tenths
      of an ephah of choice flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil. '
    11: '¹¹ The priest who cleanses shall set the person to be cleansed, along with
      these things, before the Lord, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. '
    12: '¹² The priest shall take one of the lambs, and offer it as a guilt offering,
      along with the log of oil, and raise them as an elevation offering before the
      Lord. '
    13: '¹³ He shall slaughter the lamb in the place where the sin offering and the
      burnt offering are slaughtered in the holy place; for the guilt offering, like
      the sin offering, belongs to the priest: it is most holy. '
    14: '¹⁴ The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put
      it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb
      of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm
      of his own left hand, '
    16: '¹⁶ and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and sprinkle
      some oil with his finger seven times before the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ Some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the lobe
      of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand,
      and on the big toe of the right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering. '
    18: '¹⁸ The rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head
      of the one to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement on his behalf
      before the Lord: '
    19: '¹⁹ the priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for the one
      to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Afterward he shall slaughter the burnt
      offering; '
    20: "²⁰ and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on\
      \ the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement on his behalf and he shall\
      \ be clean. \n"
    21: '²¹ But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, he shall take one male lamb
      for a guilt offering to be elevated, to make atonement on his behalf, and one-tenth
      of an ephah of choice flour mixed with oil for a grain offering and a log of
      oil; '
    22: '²² also two turtledoves or two pigeons, such as he can afford, one for a
      sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. '
    23: '²³ On the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest,
      to the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the Lord; '
    24: '²⁴ and the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of
      oil, and the priest shall raise them as an elevation offering before the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering and shall take
      some of the blood of the guilt offering, and put it on the lobe of the right
      ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the
      big toe of the right foot. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand, '
    27: '²⁷ and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his
      left hand seven times before the Lord. '
    28: '²⁸ The priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the lobe of
      the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand,
      and the big toe of the right foot, where the blood of the guilt offering was
      placed. '
    29: '²⁹ The rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head
      of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before the Lord. '
    30: '³⁰ And he shall offer, of the turtledoves or pigeons such as he can afford, '
    31: '³¹ one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along with
      a grain offering; and the priest shall make atonement before the Lord on behalf
      of the one being cleansed. '
    32: "³² This is the ritual for the one who has a leprous disease, who cannot afford\
      \ the offerings for his cleansing. \n"
    33: "³³ The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: \n"
    34: '³⁴ When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession,
      and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession, '
    35: '³⁵ the owner of the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, “There
      seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house.” '
    36: '³⁶ The priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes
      to examine the disease, or all that is in the house will become unclean; and
      afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house. '
    37: '³⁷ He shall examine the disease; if the disease is in the walls of the house
      with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface, '
    38: '³⁸ the priest shall go outside to the door of the house and shut up the house
      seven days. '
    39: '³⁹ The priest shall come again on the seventh day and make an inspection;
      if the disease has spread in the walls of the house, '
    40: '⁴⁰ the priest shall command that the stones in which the disease appears
      be taken out and thrown into an unclean place outside the city. '
    41: '⁴¹ He shall have the inside of the house scraped thoroughly, and the plaster
      that is scraped off shall be dumped in an unclean place outside the city. '
    42: "⁴² They shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones,\
      \ and take other plaster and plaster the house. \n"
    43: '⁴³ If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the
      stones and scraped the house and plastered it, '
    44: '⁴⁴ the priest shall go and make inspection; if the disease has spread in
      the house, it is a spreading leprous disease in the house; it is unclean. '
    45: '⁴⁵ He shall have the house torn down, its stones and timber and all the plaster
      of the house, and taken outside the city to an unclean place. '
    46: '⁴⁶ All who enter the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the
      evening; '
    47: "⁴⁷ and all who sleep in the house shall wash their clothes; and all who eat\
      \ in the house shall wash their clothes. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ If the priest comes and makes an inspection, and the disease has not spread
      in the house after the house was plastered, the priest shall pronounce the house
      clean; the disease is healed. '
    49: '⁴⁹ For the cleansing of the house he shall take two birds, with cedarwood
      and crimson yarn and hyssop, '
    50: '⁵⁰ and shall slaughter one of the birds over fresh water in an earthen vessel, '
    51: '⁵¹ and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the crimson yarn, along
      with the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and
      the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times. '
    52: '⁵² Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the
      fresh water, and with the living bird, and with the cedarwood and hyssop and
      crimson yarn; '
    53: "⁵³ and he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field;\
      \ so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean. \n"
    54: '⁵⁴ This is the ritual for any leprous disease: for an itch, '
    55: '⁵⁵ for leprous diseases in clothing and houses, '
    56: '⁵⁶ and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot, '
    57: ⁵⁷ to determine when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the ritual
      for leprous diseases.

      for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the
      priests and for all the people of the assembly. '
    34: ³⁴ This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the

      it as an offering to the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord, he shall be

      people. '
    5: '⁵ This is in order that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices that

      for making atonement for your lives on the altar; for, as life, it is the blood
      that makes atonement. '
    12: '¹² Therefore I have said to the people of Israel: No person among you shall
      eat blood, nor shall any alien who resides among you eat blood. '

    4: '⁴ But he shall not defile himself as a husband among his people and so profane
      himself. '
    5: '⁵ They shall not make bald spots upon their heads, or shave off the edges
      of their beards, or make any gashes in their flesh. '
    6: '⁶ They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God;
      for they offer the Lord’s offerings by fire, the food of their God; therefore
      they shall be holy. '
    7: '⁷ They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled; neither
      shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband. For they are holy to their
      God, '
    8: '⁸ and you shall treat them as holy, since they offer the food of your God;
      they shall be holy to you, for I the Lord, I who sanctify you, am holy. '
    9: "⁹ When the daughter of a priest profanes herself through prostitution, she\
      \ profanes her father; she shall be burned to death. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The priest who is exalted above his fellows, on whose head the anointing
      oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the vestments, shall
      not dishevel his hair, nor tear his vestments. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall not go where there is a dead body; he shall not defile himself
      even for his father or mother. '
    12: '¹² He shall not go outside the sanctuary and thus profane the sanctuary of
      his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I
      am the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ He shall marry only a woman who is a virgin. '
    14: '¹⁴ A widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, a prostitute,
      these he shall not marry. He shall marry a virgin of his own kin, '
    15: "¹⁵ that he may not profane his offspring among his kin; for I am the Lord;\
      \ I sanctify him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    17: '¹⁷ Speak to Aaron and say: No one of your offspring throughout their generations
      who has a blemish may approach to offer the food of his God. '
    18: '¹⁸ For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, one who is blind or lame,
      or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long, '
    19: '¹⁹ or one who has a broken foot or a broken hand, '
    20: '²⁰ or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or a man with a blemish in his eyes or an
      itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles. '
    21: '²¹ No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to
      offer the Lord’s offerings by fire; since he has a blemish, he shall not come
      near to offer the food of his God. '
    22: '²² He may eat the food of his God, of the most holy as well as of the holy. '
    23: '²³ But he shall not come near the curtain or approach the altar, because
      he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries; for I am the Lord;
      I sanctify them. '
    24: ²⁴ Thus Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
  22:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² Direct Aaron and his sons to deal carefully with the sacred donations of
      the people of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so that they may not profane
      my holy name; I am the Lord. '
    3: '³ Say to them: If anyone among all your offspring throughout your generations
      comes near the sacred donations, which the people of Israel dedicate to the
      Lord, while he is in a state of uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from
      my presence: I am the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ No one of Aaron’s offspring who has a leprous disease or suffers a discharge
      may eat of the sacred donations until he is clean. Whoever touches anything
      made unclean by a corpse or a man who has had an emission of semen, '
    5: '⁵ and whoever touches any swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or
      any human being by whom he may be made unclean—whatever his uncleanness may
      be— '
    6: '⁶ the person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening and shall
      not eat of the sacred donations unless he has washed his body in water. '
    7: '⁷ When the sun sets he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the sacred
      donations, for they are his food. '
    8: '⁸ That which died or was torn by wild animals he shall not eat, becoming unclean
      by it: I am the Lord. '
    9: "⁹ They shall keep my charge, so that they may not incur guilt and die in the\
      \ sanctuary for having profaned it: I am the Lord; I sanctify them. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ No lay person shall eat of the sacred donations. No bound or hired servant
      of the priest shall eat of the sacred donations; '
    11: '¹¹ but if a priest acquires anyone by purchase, the person may eat of them;
      and those that are born in his house may eat of his food. '
    12: '¹² If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the offering
      of the sacred donations; '
    13: '¹³ but if a priest’s daughter is widowed or divorced, without offspring,
      and returns to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s
      food. No lay person shall eat of it. '
    14: '¹⁴ If a man eats of the sacred donation unintentionally, he shall add one-fifth
      of its value to it, and give the sacred donation to the priest. '
    15: '¹⁵ No one shall profane the sacred donations of the people of Israel, which
      they offer to the Lord, '
    16: "¹⁶ causing them to bear guilt requiring a guilt offering, by eating their\
      \ sacred donations: for I am the Lord; I sanctify them. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    18: '¹⁸ Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them:
      When anyone of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing in Israel presents
      an offering, whether in payment of a vow or as a freewill offering that is offered
      to the Lord as a burnt offering, '
    19: '¹⁹ to be acceptable in your behalf it shall be a male without blemish, of
      the cattle or the sheep or the goats. '
    20: "²⁰ You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable\
      \ in your behalf. \n"
    21: '²¹ When anyone offers a sacrifice of well-being to the Lord, in fulfillment
      of a vow or as a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, to be acceptable
      it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it. '
    22: '²² Anything blind, or injured, or maimed, or having a discharge or an itch
      or scabs—these you shall not offer to the Lord or put any of them on the altar
      as offerings by fire to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ An ox or a lamb that has a limb too long or too short you may present
      for a freewill offering; but it will not be accepted for a vow. '
    24: '²⁴ Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you
      shall not offer to the Lord; such you shall not do within your land, '
    25: "²⁵ nor shall you accept any such animals from a foreigner to offer as food\
      \ to your God; since they are mutilated, with a blemish in them, they shall\
      \ not be accepted in your behalf. \n"
    26: '²⁶ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    27: '²⁷ When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with
      its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as the Lord’s
      offering by fire. '
    28: '²⁸ But you shall not slaughter, from the herd or the flock, an animal with
      its young on the same day. '
    29: '²⁹ When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice
      it so that it may be acceptable in your behalf. '
    30: "³⁰ It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall not leave any of it until\
      \ morning: I am the Lord. \n"
    31: '³¹ Thus you shall keep my commandments and observe them: I am the Lord. '
    32: '³² You shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the
      people of Israel: I am the Lord; I sanctify you, '
    33: '³³ I who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the Lord.'
  23:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '

    8: "⁸ For seven days you shall present the Lord’s offerings by fire; on the seventh\

    9: '⁹ The Lord spoke to Moses: '
    10: '¹⁰ Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land
      that I am giving you and you reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of
      the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall raise the sheaf before the Lord, that you may find acceptance;
      on the day after the sabbath the priest shall raise it. '
    12: '¹² On the day when you raise the sheaf, you shall offer a lamb a year old,
      without blemish, as a burnt offering to the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ And the grain offering with it shall be two-tenths of an ephah of choice
      flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the Lord; and

    15: '¹⁵ And from the day after the sabbath, from the day on which you bring the
      sheaf of the elevation offering, you shall count off seven weeks; they shall
      be complete. '
    16: '¹⁶ You shall count until the day after the seventh sabbath, fifty days; then
      you shall present an offering of new grain to the Lord. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall bring from your settlements two loaves of bread as an elevation
      offering, each made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of choice flour,
      baked with leaven, as first fruits to the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish,
      one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to the Lord, along
      with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of
      pleasing odor to the Lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs
      a year old as a sacrifice of well-being. '
    20: '²⁰ The priest shall raise them with the bread of the first fruits as an elevation
      offering before the Lord, together with the two lambs; they shall be holy to

    23: '²³ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '

      day of the month, you shall observe a day of complete rest, a holy convocation
      commemorated with trumpet blasts. '
    25: "²⁵ You shall not work at your occupations; and you shall present the Lord’s\

    38: "³⁸ apart from the sabbaths of the Lord, and apart from your gifts, and apart\
      \ from all your votive offerings, and apart from all your freewill offerings,\
      \ which you give to the Lord. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Now, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in
      the produce of the land, you shall keep the festival of the Lord, lasting seven
      days; a complete rest on the first day, and a complete rest on the eighth day. '
    40: '⁴⁰ On the first day you shall take the fruit of majestic trees, branches
      of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall
      rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. '
    41: '⁴¹ You shall keep it as a festival to the Lord seven days in the year; you
      shall keep it in the seventh month as a statute forever throughout your generations. '
    42: '⁴² You shall live in booths for seven days; all that are citizens in Israel
      shall live in booths, '
    43: "⁴³ so that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel live\
      \ in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your\
      \ God. \n"
    44: ⁴⁴ Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed festivals of
      the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of beaten olives for
      the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly. '
    3: '³ Aaron shall set it up in the tent of meeting, outside the curtain of the
      covenant, to burn from evening to morning before the Lord regularly; it shall
      be a statute forever throughout your generations. '
    4: "⁴ He shall set up the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold before the Lord\
      \ regularly. \n"
    5: '⁵ You shall take choice flour, and bake twelve loaves of it; two-tenths of
      an ephah shall be in each loaf. '
    6: '⁶ You shall place them in two rows, six in a row, on the table of pure gold. '
    7: '⁷ You shall put pure frankincense with each row, to be a token offering for
      the bread, as an offering by fire to the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ Every sabbath day Aaron shall set them in order before the Lord regularly
      as a commitment of the people of Israel, as a covenant forever. '
    9: "⁹ They shall be for Aaron and his descendants, who shall eat them in a holy\
      \ place, for they are most holy portions for him from the offerings by fire\
      \ to the Lord, a perpetual due. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ A man whose mother was an Israelite and whose father was an Egyptian came
      out among the people of Israel; and the Israelite woman’s son and a certain
      Israelite began fighting in the camp. '
    11: '¹¹ The Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the Name in a curse. And they brought
      him to Moses—now his mother’s name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the
      tribe of Dan— '
    12: "¹² and they put him in custody, until the decision of the Lord should be\
      \ made clear to them. \n"
    13: '¹³ The Lord said to Moses, saying: '
    14: '¹⁴ Take the blasphemer outside the camp; and let all who were within hearing
      lay their hands on his head, and let the whole congregation stone him. '
    15: '¹⁵ And speak to the people of Israel, saying: Anyone who curses God shall
      bear the sin. '
    16: '¹⁶ One who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death; the whole
      congregation shall stone the blasphemer. Aliens as well as citizens, when they
      blaspheme the Name, shall be put to death. '
    17: '¹⁷ Anyone who kills a human being shall be put to death. '
    18: '¹⁸ Anyone who kills an animal shall make restitution for it, life for life. '
    19: '¹⁹ Anyone who maims another shall suffer the same injury in return: '
    20: '²⁰ fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; the injury inflicted
      is the injury to be suffered. '
    21: '²¹ One who kills an animal shall make restitution for it; but one who kills
      a human being shall be put to death. '
    22: '²² You shall have one law for the alien and for the citizen: for I am the
      Lord your God. '
    23: ²³ Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel; and they took the blasphemer
      outside the camp, and stoned him to death. The people of Israel did as the Lord
      had commanded Moses.
  25:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying: '
    2: '² Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land that
      I am giving you, the land shall observe a sabbath for the Lord. '
    3: '³ Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard,
      and gather in their yield; '
    4: '⁴ but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of complete rest for the
      land, a sabbath for the Lord: you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard. '
    5: '⁵ You shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes
      of your unpruned vine: it shall be a year of complete rest for the land. '
    6: '⁶ You may eat what the land yields during its sabbath—you, your male and female
      slaves, your hired and your bound laborers who live with you; '
    7: "⁷ for your livestock also, and for the wild animals in your land all its yield\
      \ shall be for food. \n"
    8: '⁸ You shall count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that
      the period of seven weeks of years gives forty-nine years. '
    9: '⁹ Then you shall have the trumpet sounded loud; on the tenth day of the seventh
      month—on the day of atonement—you shall have the trumpet sounded throughout
      all your land. '
    10: '¹⁰ And you shall hallow the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim liberty
      throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you: you
      shall return, every one of you, to your property and every one of you to your
      family. '
    11: '¹¹ That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you: you shall not sow, or reap
      the aftergrowth, or harvest the unpruned vines. '
    12: "¹² For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat only what\
      \ the field itself produces. \n"
    13: '¹³ In this year of jubilee you shall return, every one of you, to your property. '
    14: '¹⁴ When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall
      not cheat one another. '
    15: '¹⁵ When you buy from your neighbor, you shall pay only for the number of
      years since the jubilee; the seller shall charge you only for the remaining
      crop years. '
    16: '¹⁶ If the years are more, you shall increase the price, and if the years
      are fewer, you shall diminish the price; for it is a certain number of harvests
      that are being sold to you. '
    17: "¹⁷ You shall not cheat one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am\
      \ the Lord your God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ You shall observe my statutes and faithfully keep my ordinances, so that
      you may live on the land securely. '
    19: '¹⁹ The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live on
      it securely. '
    20: '²⁰ Should you ask, “What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not
      sow or gather in our crop?” '
    21: '²¹ I will order my blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will yield
      a crop for three years. '
    22: '²² When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating from the old crop;
      until the ninth year, when its produce comes in, you shall eat the old. '
    23: '²³ The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; with me
      you are but aliens and tenants. '
    24: "²⁴ Throughout the land that you hold, you shall provide for the redemption\
      \ of the land. \n"
    25: '²⁵ If anyone of your kin falls into difficulty and sells a piece of property,
      then the next of kin shall come and redeem what the relative has sold. '
    26: '²⁶ If the person has no one to redeem it, but then prospers and finds sufficient
      means to do so, '
    27: '²⁷ the years since its sale shall be computed and the difference shall be
      refunded to the person to whom it was sold, and the property shall be returned. '
    28: "²⁸ But if there are not sufficient means to recover it, what was sold shall\
      \ remain with the purchaser until the year of jubilee; in the jubilee it shall\
      \ be released, and the property shall be returned. \n"
    29: '²⁹ If anyone sells a dwelling house in a walled city, it may be redeemed
      until a year has elapsed since its sale; the right of redemption shall be one
      year. '
    30: '³⁰ If it is not redeemed before a full year has elapsed, a house that is
      in a walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the purchaser, throughout the generations;
      it shall not be released in the jubilee. '
    31: '³¹ But houses in villages that have no walls around them shall be classed
      as open country; they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee. '
    32: '³² As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites shall forever have the right
      of redemption of the houses in the cities belonging to them. '
    33: '³³ Such property as may be redeemed from the Levites—houses sold in a city
      belonging to them—shall be released in the jubilee; because the houses in the
      cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel. '
    34: "³⁴ But the open land around their cities may not be sold; for that is their\
      \ possession for all time. \n"
    35: '³⁵ If any of your kin fall into difficulty and become dependent on you, you
      shall support them; they shall live with you as though resident aliens. '
    36: '³⁶ Do not take interest in advance or otherwise make a profit from them,
      but fear your God; let them live with you. '
    37: '³⁷ You shall not lend them your money at interest taken in advance, or provide
      them food at a profit. '
    38: "³⁸ I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give\
      \ you the land of Canaan, to be your God. \n"
    39: '³⁹ If any who are dependent on you become so impoverished that they sell
      themselves to you, you shall not make them serve as slaves. '
    40: '⁴⁰ They shall remain with you as hired or bound laborers. They shall serve
      with you until the year of the jubilee. '
    41: '⁴¹ Then they and their children with them shall be free from your authority;
      they shall go back to their own family and return to their ancestral property. '
    42: '⁴² For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they
      shall not be sold as slaves are sold. '
    43: '⁴³ You shall not rule over them with harshness, but shall fear your God. '
    44: '⁴⁴ As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations
      around you that you may acquire male and female slaves. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and
      from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and
      they may be your property. '
    46: "⁴⁶ You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them\
      \ to inherit as property. These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow\
      \ Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ If resident aliens among you prosper, and if any of your kin fall into
      difficulty with one of them and sell themselves to an alien, or to a branch
      of the alien’s family, '
    48: '⁴⁸ after they have sold themselves they shall have the right of redemption;
      one of their brothers may redeem them, '
    49: '⁴⁹ or their uncle or their uncle’s son may redeem them, or anyone of their
      family who is of their own flesh may redeem them; or if they prosper they may
      redeem themselves. '
    50: '⁵⁰ They shall compute with the purchaser the total from the year when they
      sold themselves to the alien until the jubilee year; the price of the sale shall
      be applied to the number of years: the time they were with the owner shall be
      rated as the time of a hired laborer. '
    51: '⁵¹ If many years remain, they shall pay for their redemption in proportion
      to the purchase price; '
    52: '⁵² and if few years remain until the jubilee year, they shall compute thus:
      according to the years involved they shall make payment for their redemption. '
    53: '⁵³ As a laborer hired by the year they shall be under the alien’s authority,
      who shall not, however, rule with harshness over them in your sight. '
    54: '⁵⁴ And if they have not been redeemed in any of these ways, they and their
      children with them shall go free in the jubilee year. '
    55: '⁵⁵ For to me the people of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom
      I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.'
  26:
    1: '¹ You shall make for yourselves no idols and erect no carved images or pillars,
      and you shall not place figured stones in your land, to worship at them; for
      I am the Lord your God. '
    2: "² You shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord. \n"
    3: '³ If you follow my statutes and keep my commandments and observe them faithfully, '
    4: '⁴ I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its
      produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. '
    5: '⁵ Your threshing shall overtake the vintage, and the vintage shall overtake
      the sowing; you shall eat your bread to the full, and live securely in your
      land. '
    6: '⁶ And I will grant peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one shall
      make you afraid; I will remove dangerous animals from the land, and no sword
      shall go through your land. '
    7: '⁷ You shall give chase to your enemies, and they shall fall before you by
      the sword. '
    8: '⁸ Five of you shall give chase to a hundred, and a hundred of you shall give
      chase to ten thousand; your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. '
    9: '⁹ I will look with favor upon you and make you fruitful and multiply you;
      and I will maintain my covenant with you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall eat old grain long stored, and you shall have to clear out the
      old to make way for the new. '
    11: '¹¹ I will place my dwelling in your midst, and I shall not abhor you. '
    12: '¹² And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people. '
    13: "¹³ I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be\
      \ their slaves no more; I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk\
      \ erect. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ But if you will not obey me, and do not observe all these commandments, '
    15: '¹⁵ if you spurn my statutes, and abhor my ordinances, so that you will not
      observe all my commandments, and you break my covenant, '
    16: '¹⁶ I in turn will do this to you: I will bring terror on you; consumption
      and fever that waste the eyes and cause life to pine away. You shall sow your
      seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. '
    17: '¹⁷ I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down by your enemies;
      your foes shall rule over you, and you shall flee though no one pursues you. '
    18: '¹⁸ And if in spite of this you will not obey me, I will continue to punish
      you sevenfold for your sins. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will break your proud glory, and I will make your sky like iron and
      your earth like copper. '
    20: "²⁰ Your strength shall be spent to no purpose: your land shall not yield\
      \ its produce, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit. \n"
    21: '²¹ If you continue hostile to me, and will not obey me, I will continue to
      plague you sevenfold for your sins. '
    22: "²² I will let loose wild animals against you, and they shall bereave you\
      \ of your children and destroy your livestock; they shall make you few in number,\
      \ and your roads shall be deserted. \n"
    23: '²³ If in spite of these punishments you have not turned back to me, but continue
      hostile to me, '
    24: '²⁴ then I too will continue hostile to you: I myself will strike you sevenfold
      for your sins. '
    25: '²⁵ I will bring the sword against you, executing vengeance for the covenant;
      and if you withdraw within your cities, I will send pestilence among you, and
      you shall be delivered into enemy hands. '
    26: "²⁶ When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a\
      \ single oven, and they shall dole out your bread by weight; and though you\
      \ eat, you shall not be satisfied. \n"
    27: '²⁷ But if, despite this, you disobey me, and continue hostile to me, '
    28: '²⁸ I will continue hostile to you in fury; I in turn will punish you myself
      sevenfold for your sins. '
    29: '²⁹ You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your
      daughters. '
    30: '³⁰ I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars; I will
      heap your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols. I will abhor you. '
    31: '³¹ I will lay your cities waste, will make your sanctuaries desolate, and
      I will not smell your pleasing odors. '
    32: '³² I will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to settle in
      it shall be appalled at it. '
    33: "³³ And you I will scatter among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword\
      \ against you; your land shall be a desolation, and your cities a waste. \n"
    34: '³⁴ Then the land shall enjoy its sabbath years as long as it lies desolate,
      while you are in the land of your enemies; then the land shall rest, and enjoy
      its sabbath years. '
    35: '³⁵ As long as it lies desolate, it shall have the rest it did not have on
      your sabbaths when you were living on it. '
    36: '³⁶ And as for those of you who survive, I will send faintness into their
      hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them
      to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall
      though no one pursues. '
    37: '³⁷ They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though no
      one pursues; and you shall have no power to stand against your enemies. '
    38: '³⁸ You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall
      devour you. '
    39: "³⁹ And those of you who survive shall languish in the land of your enemies\
      \ because of their iniquities; also they shall languish because of the iniquities\
      \ of their ancestors. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors,
      in that they committed treachery against me and, moreover, that they continued
      hostile to me— '
    41: '⁴¹ so that I, in turn, continued hostile to them and brought them into the
      land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they
      make amends for their iniquity, '
    42: '⁴² then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; I will remember also my covenant
      with Isaac and also my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. '
    43: '⁴³ For the land shall be deserted by them, and enjoy its sabbath years by
      lying desolate without them, while they shall make amends for their iniquity,
      because they dared to spurn my ordinances, and they abhorred my statutes. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not
      spurn them, or abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant
      with them; for I am the Lord their God; '
    45: "⁴⁵ but I will remember in their favor the covenant with their ancestors whom\
      \ I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, to be their\
      \ God: I am the Lord. \n"
    46: ⁴⁶ These are the statutes and ordinances and laws that the Lord established
      between himself and the people of Israel on Mount Sinai through Moses.
  27:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: '
    2: '² Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When a person makes an explicit
      vow to the Lord concerning the equivalent for a human being, '
    3: '³ the equivalent for a male shall be: from twenty to sixty years of age the
      equivalent shall be fifty shekels of silver by the sanctuary shekel. '
    4: '⁴ If the person is a female, the equivalent is thirty shekels. '
    5: '⁵ If the age is from five to twenty years of age, the equivalent is twenty
      shekels for a male and ten shekels for a female. '
    6: '⁶ If the age is from one month to five years, the equivalent for a male is
      five shekels of silver, and for a female the equivalent is three shekels of
      silver. '
    7: '⁷ And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the equivalent for a
      male is fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. '
    8: "⁸ If any cannot afford the equivalent, they shall be brought before the priest\
      \ and the priest shall assess them; the priest shall assess them according to\
      \ what each one making a vow can afford. \n"
    9: '⁹ If it concerns an animal that may be brought as an offering to the Lord,
      any such that may be given to the Lord shall be holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ Another shall not be exchanged or substituted for it, either good for
      bad or bad for good; and if one animal is substituted for another, both that
      one and its substitute shall be holy. '
    11: '¹¹ If it concerns any unclean animal that may not be brought as an offering
      to the Lord, the animal shall be presented before the priest. '
    12: '¹² The priest shall assess it: whether good or bad, according to the assessment
      of the priest, so it shall be. '
    13: "¹³ But if it is to be redeemed, one-fifth must be added to the assessment.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ If a person consecrates a house to the Lord, the priest shall assess it:
      whether good or bad, as the priest assesses it, so it shall stand. '
    15: "¹⁵ And if the one who consecrates the house wishes to redeem it, one-fifth\
      \ shall be added to its assessed value, and it shall revert to the original\
      \ owner. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ If a person consecrates to the Lord any inherited landholding, its assessment
      shall be in accordance with its seed requirements: fifty shekels of silver to
      a homer of barley seed. '
    17: '¹⁷ If the person consecrates the field as of the year of jubilee, that assessment
      shall stand; '
    18: '¹⁸ but if the field is consecrated after the jubilee, the priest shall compute
      the price for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee,
      and the assessment shall be reduced. '
    19: '¹⁹ And if the one who consecrates the field wishes to redeem it, then one-fifth
      shall be added to its assessed value, and it shall revert to the original owner; '
    20: '²⁰ but if the field is not redeemed, or if it has been sold to someone else,
      it shall no longer be redeemable. '
    21: '²¹ But when the field is released in the jubilee, it shall be holy to the
      Lord as a devoted field; it becomes the priest’s holding. '
    22: '²² If someone consecrates to the Lord a field that has been purchased, which
      is not a part of the inherited landholding, '
    23: '²³ the priest shall compute for it the proportionate assessment up to the
      year of jubilee, and the assessment shall be paid as of that day, a sacred donation
      to the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it
      was bought, whose holding the land is. '
    25: "²⁵ All assessments shall be by the sanctuary shekel: twenty gerahs shall\
      \ make a shekel. \n"
    26: '²⁶ A firstling of animals, however, which as a firstling belongs to the Lord,
      cannot be consecrated by anyone; whether ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s. '
    27: "²⁷ If it is an unclean animal, it shall be ransomed at its assessment, with\
      \ one-fifth added; if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at its assessment.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ Nothing that a person owns that has been devoted to destruction for the
      Lord, be it human or animal, or inherited landholding, may be sold or redeemed;
      every devoted thing is most holy to the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ No human beings who have been devoted to destruction can be ransomed;\
      \ they shall be put to death. \n"
    30: '³⁰ All tithes from the land, whether the seed from the ground or the fruit
      from the tree, are the Lord’s; they are holy to the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ If persons wish to redeem any of their tithes, they must add one-fifth
      to them. '
    32: '³² All tithes of herd and flock, every tenth one that passes under the shepherd’s
      staff, shall be holy to the Lord. '
    33: "³³ Let no one inquire whether it is good or bad, or make substitution for\
      \ it; if one makes substitution for it, then both it and the substitute shall\
      \ be holy and cannot be redeemed. \n"
    34: ³⁴ These are the commandments that the Lord gave to Moses for the people of
      Israel on Mount Sinai.
