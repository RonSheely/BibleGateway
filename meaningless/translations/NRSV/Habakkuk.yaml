Habakkuk:
  1:
    1: "¹ The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw. \n"
    2: "² O Lord, how long shall I cry for help,\n    and you will not listen?\nOr\
      \ cry to you “Violence!”\n    and you will not save?\n"
    3: "³ Why do you make me see wrongdoing\n    and look at trouble?\nDestruction\
      \ and violence are before me;\n    strife and contention arise.\n"
    4: "⁴ So the law becomes slack\n    and justice never prevails.\nThe wicked surround\
      \ the righteous—\n    therefore judgment comes forth perverted. \n"
    5: "⁵ Look at the nations, and see!\n    Be astonished! Be astounded!\nFor a work\
      \ is being done in your days\n    that you would not believe if you were told.\n"
    6: "⁶ For I am rousing the Chaldeans,\n    that fierce and impetuous nation,\n\
      who march through the breadth of the earth\n    to seize dwellings not their\
      \ own.\n"
    7: "⁷ Dread and fearsome are they;\n    their justice and dignity proceed from\
      \ themselves.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their horses are swifter than leopards,\n    more menacing than wolves at\
      \ dusk;\n    their horses charge.\nTheir horsemen come from far away;\n    they\
      \ fly like an eagle swift to devour.\n"
    9: "⁹ They all come for violence,\n    with faces pressing forward;\n    they\
      \ gather captives like sand.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ At kings they scoff,\n    and of rulers they make sport.\nThey laugh at\
      \ every fortress,\n    and heap up earth to take it.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then they sweep by like the wind;\n    they transgress and become guilty;\n\
      \    their own might is their god! \n"
    12: "¹² Are you not from of old,\n    O Lord my God, my Holy One?\n    You shall\
      \ not die.\nO Lord, you have marked them for judgment;\n    and you, O Rock,\
      \ have established them for punishment.\n"
    13: "¹³ Your eyes are too pure to behold evil,\n    and you cannot look on wrongdoing;\n\
      why do you look on the treacherous,\n    and are silent when the wicked swallow\n\
      \    those more righteous than they?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You have made people like the fish of the sea,\n    like crawling things\
      \ that have no ruler. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The enemy brings all of them up with a hook;\n    he drags them out with\
      \ his net,\nhe gathers them in his seine;\n    so he rejoices and exults.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore he sacrifices to his net\n    and makes offerings to his seine;\n\
      for by them his portion is lavish,\n    and his food is rich.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Is he then to keep on emptying his net,\n    and destroying nations without\
      \ mercy?"
  2:
    1: "¹ I will stand at my watchpost,\n    and station myself on the rampart;\n\
      I will keep watch to see what he will say to me,\n    and what he will answer\
      \ concerning my complaint.\n"
    2: "² Then the Lord answered me and said:\nWrite the vision;\n    make it plain\
      \ on tablets,\n    so that a runner may read it.\n"
    3: "³ For there is still a vision for the appointed time;\n    it speaks of the\
      \ end, and does not lie.\nIf it seems to tarry, wait for it;\n    it will surely\
      \ come, it will not delay.\n"
    4: "⁴ Look at the proud!\n    Their spirit is not right in them,\n    but the\
      \ righteous live by their faith.\n"
    5: "⁵ Moreover, wealth is treacherous;\n    the arrogant do not endure.\nThey\
      \ open their throats wide as Sheol;\n    like Death they never have enough.\n\
      They gather all nations for themselves,\n    and collect all peoples as their\
      \ own. \n"
    6: "⁶ Shall not everyone taunt such people and, with mocking riddles, say about\
      \ them,\n“Alas for you who heap up what is not your own!”\n    How long will\
      \ you load yourselves with goods taken in pledge?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will not your own creditors suddenly rise,\n    and those who make you tremble\
      \ wake up?\n    Then you will be booty for them.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because you have plundered many nations,\n    all that survive of the peoples\
      \ shall plunder you—\nbecause of human bloodshed, and violence to the earth,\n\
      \    to cities and all who live in them. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Alas for you who get evil gain for your house,\n    setting your nest on\
      \ high\n    to be safe from the reach of harm!”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You have devised shame for your house\n    by cutting off many peoples;\n\
      \    you have forfeited your life.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The very stones will cry out from the wall,\n    and the plaster will\
      \ respond from the woodwork. \n"
    12: "¹² “Alas for you who build a town by bloodshed,\n    and found a city on\
      \ iniquity!”\n"
    13: "¹³ Is it not from the Lord of hosts\n    that peoples labor only to feed\
      \ the flames,\n    and nations weary themselves for nothing?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But the earth will be filled\n    with the knowledge of the glory of the\
      \ Lord,\n    as the waters cover the sea. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Alas for you who make your neighbors drink,\n    pouring out your wrath\
      \ until they are drunk,\n    in order to gaze on their nakedness!”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You will be sated with contempt instead of glory.\n    Drink, you yourself,\
      \ and stagger!\nThe cup in the Lord’s right hand\n    will come around to you,\n\
      \    and shame will come upon your glory!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you;\n    the destruction\
      \ of the animals will terrify you—\nbecause of human bloodshed and violence\
      \ to the earth,\n    to cities and all who live in them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ What use is an idol\n    once its maker has shaped it—\n    a cast image,\
      \ a teacher of lies?\nFor its maker trusts in what has been made,\n    though\
      \ the product is only an idol that cannot speak!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Alas for you who say to the wood, “Wake up!”\n    to silent stone, “Rouse\
      \ yourself!”\n    Can it teach?\nSee, it is gold and silver plated,\n    and\
      \ there is no breath in it at all. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord is in his holy temple;\n    let all the earth keep silence\
      \ before him!"
  3:
    1: "¹ A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk according to Shigionoth. \n"
    2: "² O Lord, I have heard of your renown,\n    and I stand in awe, O Lord, of\
      \ your work.\nIn our own time revive it;\n    in our own time make it known;\n\
      \    in wrath may you remember mercy.\n"
    3: "³ God came from Teman,\n    the Holy One from Mount Paran.\nHis glory covered\
      \ the heavens,\n    and the earth was full of his praise.\n"
    4: "⁴ The brightness was like the sun;\n    rays came forth from his hand,\n \
      \   where his power lay hidden.\n"
    5: "⁵ Before him went pestilence,\n    and plague followed close behind.\n"
    6: "⁶ He stopped and shook the earth;\n    he looked and made the nations tremble.\n\
      The eternal mountains were shattered;\n    along his ancient pathways\n    the\
      \ everlasting hills sank low.\n"
    7: "⁷ I saw the tents of Cushan under affliction;\n    the tent-curtains of the\
      \ land of Midian trembled.\n"
    8: "⁸ Was your wrath against the rivers, O Lord?\n    Or your anger against the\
      \ rivers,\n    or your rage against the sea,\nwhen you drove your horses,\n\
      \    your chariots to victory?\n"
    9: "⁹ You brandished your naked bow,\n    sated were the arrows at your command.\n\
      \    You split the earth with rivers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The mountains saw you, and writhed;\n    a torrent of water swept by;\n\
      the deep gave forth its voice.\n    The sun raised high its hands;\n"
    11: "¹¹ the moon stood still in its exalted place,\n    at the light of your arrows\
      \ speeding by,\n    at the gleam of your flashing spear.\n"
    12: "¹² In fury you trod the earth,\n    in anger you trampled nations.\n"
    13: "¹³ You came forth to save your people,\n    to save your anointed.\nYou crushed\
      \ the head of the wicked house,\n    laying it bare from foundation to roof.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You pierced with their own arrows the head of his warriors,\n    who came\
      \ like a whirlwind to scatter us,\n    gloating as if ready to devour the poor\
      \ who were in hiding.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You trampled the sea with your horses,\n    churning the mighty waters.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I hear, and I tremble within;\n    my lips quiver at the sound.\nRottenness\
      \ enters into my bones,\n    and my steps tremble beneath me.\nI wait quietly\
      \ for the day of calamity\n    to come upon the people who attack us. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Though the fig tree does not blossom,\n    and no fruit is on the vines;\n\
      though the produce of the olive fails,\n    and the fields yield no food;\n\
      though the flock is cut off from the fold,\n    and there is no herd in the\
      \ stalls,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ yet I will rejoice in the Lord;\n    I will exult in the God of my salvation.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ God, the Lord, is my strength;\n    he makes my feet like the feet of\
      \ a deer,\n    and makes me tread upon the heights.\nTo the leader: with stringed\
      \ instruments."
