Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "¹ How lonely sits the city\n    that once was full of people!\nHow like a\
      \ widow she has become,\n    she that was great among the nations!\nShe that\
      \ was a princess among the provinces\n    has become a vassal. \n"
    2: "² She weeps bitterly in the night,\n    with tears on her cheeks;\namong all\
      \ her lovers\n    she has no one to comfort her;\nall her friends have dealt\
      \ treacherously with her,\n    they have become her enemies. \n"
    3: "³ Judah has gone into exile with suffering\n    and hard servitude;\nshe lives\
      \ now among the nations,\n    and finds no resting place;\nher pursuers have\
      \ all overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress. \n"
    4: "⁴ The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for no one comes to the festivals;\nall her\
      \ gates are desolate,\n    her priests groan;\nher young girls grieve,\n   \
      \ and her lot is bitter. \n"
    5: "⁵ Her foes have become the masters,\n    her enemies prosper,\nbecause the\
      \ Lord has made her suffer\n    for the multitude of her transgressions;\nher\
      \ children have gone away,\n    captives before the foe. \n"
    6: "⁶ From daughter Zion has departed\n    all her majesty.\nHer princes have\
      \ become like stags\n    that find no pasture;\nthey fled without strength\n\
      \    before the pursuer. \n"
    7: "⁷ Jerusalem remembers,\n    in the days of her affliction and wandering,\n\
      all the precious things\n    that were hers in days of old.\nWhen her people\
      \ fell into the hand of the foe,\n    and there was no one to help her,\nthe\
      \ foe looked on mocking\n    over her downfall. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem sinned grievously,\n    so she has become a mockery;\nall who\
      \ honored her despise her,\n    for they have seen her nakedness;\nshe herself\
      \ groans,\n    and turns her face away. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her uncleanness was in her skirts;\n    she took no thought of her future;\n\
      her downfall was appalling,\n    with none to comfort her.\n“O Lord, look at\
      \ my affliction,\n    for the enemy has triumphed!” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Enemies have stretched out their hands\n    over all her precious things;\n\
      she has even seen the nations\n    invade her sanctuary,\nthose whom you forbade\n\
      \    to enter your congregation. \n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people groan\n    as they search for bread;\nthey trade their\
      \ treasures for food\n    to revive their strength.\nLook, O Lord, and see\n\
      \    how worthless I have become. \n"
    12: "¹² Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n    Look and see\nif there\
      \ is any sorrow like my sorrow,\n    which was brought upon me,\nwhich the Lord\
      \ inflicted\n    on the day of his fierce anger. \n"
    13: "¹³ From on high he sent fire;\n    it went deep into my bones;\nhe spread\
      \ a net for my feet;\n    he turned me back;\nhe has left me stunned,\n    faint\
      \ all day long. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ My transgressions were bound into a yoke;\n    by his hand they were fastened\
      \ together;\nthey weigh on my neck,\n    sapping my strength;\nthe Lord handed\
      \ me over\n    to those whom I cannot withstand. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has rejected\n    all my warriors in the midst of me;\nhe proclaimed\
      \ a time against me\n    to crush my young men;\nthe Lord has trodden as in\
      \ a wine press\n    the virgin daughter Judah. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For these things I weep;\n    my eyes flow with tears;\nfor a comforter\
      \ is far from me,\n    one to revive my courage;\nmy children are desolate,\n\
      \    for the enemy has prevailed. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion stretches out her hands,\n    but there is no one to comfort her;\n\
      the Lord has commanded against Jacob\n    that his neighbors should become his\
      \ foes;\nJerusalem has become\n    a filthy thing among them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord is in the right,\n    for I have rebelled against his word;\n\
      but hear, all you peoples,\n    and behold my suffering;\nmy young women and\
      \ young men\n    have gone into captivity. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ I called to my lovers\n    but they deceived me;\nmy priests and elders\n\
      \    perished in the city\nwhile seeking food\n    to revive their strength.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ See, O Lord, how distressed I am;\n    my stomach churns,\nmy heart is\
      \ wrung within me,\n    because I have been very rebellious.\nIn the street\
      \ the sword bereaves;\n    in the house it is like death. \n"
    21: "²¹ They heard how I was groaning,\n    with no one to comfort me.\nAll my\
      \ enemies heard of my trouble;\n    they are glad that you have done it.\nBring\
      \ on the day you have announced,\n    and let them be as I am. \n"
    22: "²² Let all their evil doing come before you;\n    and deal with them\nas\
      \ you have dealt with me\n    because of all my transgressions;\nfor my groans\
      \ are many\n    and my heart is faint."
  2:
    1: "¹ How the Lord in his anger\n    has humiliated daughter Zion!\nHe has thrown\
      \ down from heaven to earth\n    the splendor of Israel;\nhe has not remembered\
      \ his footstool\n    in the day of his anger. \n"
    2: "² The Lord has destroyed without mercy\n    all the dwellings of Jacob;\n\
      in his wrath he has broken down\n    the strongholds of daughter Judah;\nhe\
      \ has brought down to the ground in dishonor\n    the kingdom and its rulers.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ He has cut down in fierce anger\n    all the might of Israel;\nhe has withdrawn\
      \ his right hand from them\n    in the face of the enemy;\nhe has burned like\
      \ a flaming fire in Jacob,\n    consuming all around. \n"
    4: "⁴ He has bent his bow like an enemy,\n    with his right hand set like a foe;\n\
      he has killed all in whom we took pride\n    in the tent of daughter Zion;\n\
      he has poured out his fury like fire. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord has become like an enemy;\n    he has destroyed Israel.\nHe has\
      \ destroyed all its palaces,\n    laid in ruins its strongholds,\nand multiplied\
      \ in daughter Judah\n    mourning and lamentation. \n"
    6: "⁶ He has broken down his booth like a garden,\n    he has destroyed his tabernacle;\n\
      the Lord has abolished in Zion\n    festival and sabbath,\nand in his fierce\
      \ indignation has spurned\n    king and priest. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has scorned his altar,\n    disowned his sanctuary;\nhe has delivered\
      \ into the hand of the enemy\n    the walls of her palaces;\na clamor was raised\
      \ in the house of the Lord\n    as on a day of festival. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord determined to lay in ruins\n    the wall of daughter Zion;\nhe\
      \ stretched the line;\n    he did not withhold his hand from destroying;\nhe\
      \ caused rampart and wall to lament;\n    they languish together. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground;\n    he has ruined and broken her bars;\n\
      her king and princes are among the nations;\n    guidance is no more,\nand her\
      \ prophets obtain\n    no vision from the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of daughter Zion\n    sit on the ground in silence;\nthey have\
      \ thrown dust on their heads\n    and put on sackcloth;\nthe young girls of\
      \ Jerusalem\n    have bowed their heads to the ground. \n"
    11: "¹¹ My eyes are spent with weeping;\n    my stomach churns;\nmy bile is poured\
      \ out on the ground\n    because of the destruction of my people,\nbecause infants\
      \ and babes faint\n    in the streets of the city. \n"
    12: "¹² They cry to their mothers,\n    “Where is bread and wine?”\nas they faint\
      \ like the wounded\n    in the streets of the city,\nas their life is poured\
      \ out\n    on their mothers’ bosom. \n"
    13: "¹³ What can I say for you, to what compare you,\n    O daughter Jerusalem?\n\
      To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you,\n    O virgin daughter Zion?\n\
      For vast as the sea is your ruin;\n    who can heal you? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your prophets have seen for you\n    false and deceptive visions;\nthey\
      \ have not exposed your iniquity\n    to restore your fortunes,\nbut have seen\
      \ oracles for you\n    that are false and misleading. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who pass along the way\n    clap their hands at you;\nthey hiss and\
      \ wag their heads\n    at daughter Jerusalem;\n“Is this the city that was called\n\
      \    the perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of all the earth?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All your enemies\n    open their mouths against you;\nthey hiss, they\
      \ gnash their teeth,\n    they cry: “We have devoured her!\nAh, this is the\
      \ day we longed for;\n    at last we have seen it!” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord has done what he purposed,\n    he has carried out his threat;\n\
      as he ordained long ago,\n    he has demolished without pity;\nhe has made the\
      \ enemy rejoice over you,\n    and exalted the might of your foes. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Cry aloud to the Lord!\n    O wall of daughter Zion!\nLet tears stream\
      \ down like a torrent\n    day and night!\nGive yourself no rest,\n    your\
      \ eyes no respite! \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Arise, cry out in the night,\n    at the beginning of the watches!\nPour\
      \ out your heart like water\n    before the presence of the Lord!\nLift your\
      \ hands to him\n    for the lives of your children,\nwho faint for hunger\n\
      \    at the head of every street. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Look, O Lord, and consider!\n    To whom have you done this?\nShould women\
      \ eat their offspring,\n    the children they have borne?\nShould priest and\
      \ prophet be killed\n    in the sanctuary of the Lord? \n"
    21: "²¹ The young and the old are lying\n    on the ground in the streets;\nmy\
      \ young women and my young men\n    have fallen by the sword;\nin the day of\
      \ your anger you have killed them,\n    slaughtering without mercy. \n"
    22: "²² You invited my enemies from all around\n    as if for a day of festival;\n\
      and on the day of the anger of the Lord\n    no one escaped or survived;\nthose\
      \ whom I bore and reared\n    my enemy has destroyed."
  3:
    1: "¹ I am one who has seen affliction\n    under the rod of God’s wrath;\n"
    2: "² he has driven and brought me\n    into darkness without any light;\n"
    3: "³ against me alone he turns his hand,\n    again and again, all day long.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ He has made my flesh and my skin waste away,\n    and broken my bones;\n"
    5: "⁵ he has besieged and enveloped me\n    with bitterness and tribulation;\n"
    6: "⁶ he has made me sit in darkness\n    like the dead of long ago. \n"
    7: "⁷ He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;\n    he has put heavy chains\
      \ on me;\n"
    8: "⁸ though I call and cry for help,\n    he shuts out my prayer;\n"
    9: "⁹ he has blocked my ways with hewn stones,\n    he has made my paths crooked.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He is a bear lying in wait for me,\n    a lion in hiding;\n"
    11: "¹¹ he led me off my way and tore me to pieces;\n    he has made me desolate;\n"
    12: "¹² he bent his bow and set me\n    as a mark for his arrow. \n"
    13: "¹³ He shot into my vitals\n    the arrows of his quiver;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have become the laughingstock of all my people,\n    the object of their\
      \ taunt-songs all day long.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He has filled me with bitterness,\n    he has sated me with wormwood.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He has made my teeth grind on gravel,\n    and made me cower in ashes;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ my soul is bereft of peace;\n    I have forgotten what happiness is;\n"
    18: "¹⁸ so I say, “Gone is my glory,\n    and all that I had hoped for from the\
      \ Lord.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The thought of my affliction and my homelessness\n    is wormwood and\
      \ gall!\n"
    20: "²⁰ My soul continually thinks of it\n    and is bowed down within me.\n"
    21: "²¹ But this I call to mind,\n    and therefore I have hope: \n"
    22: "²² The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases,\n    his mercies never come\
      \ to an end;\n"
    23: "²³ they are new every morning;\n    great is your faithfulness.\n"
    24: "²⁴ “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,\n    “therefore I will hope in\
      \ him.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord is good to those who wait for him,\n    to the soul that seeks\
      \ him.\n"
    26: "²⁶ It is good that one should wait quietly\n    for the salvation of the\
      \ Lord.\n"
    27: "²⁷ It is good for one to bear\n    the yoke in youth,\n"
    28: "²⁸ to sit alone in silence\n    when the Lord has imposed it,\n"
    29: "²⁹ to put one’s mouth to the dust\n    (there may yet be hope),\n"
    30: "³⁰ to give one’s cheek to the smiter,\n    and be filled with insults. \n"
    31: "³¹ For the Lord will not\n    reject forever.\n"
    32: "³² Although he causes grief, he will have compassion\n    according to the\
      \ abundance of his steadfast love;\n"
    33: "³³ for he does not willingly afflict\n    or grieve anyone. \n"
    34: "³⁴ When all the prisoners of the land\n    are crushed under foot,\n"
    35: "³⁵ when human rights are perverted\n    in the presence of the Most High,\n"
    36: "³⁶ when one’s case is subverted\n    —does the Lord not see it? \n"
    37: "³⁷ Who can command and have it done,\n    if the Lord has not ordained it?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Is it not from the mouth of the Most High\n    that good and bad come?\n"
    39: "³⁹ Why should any who draw breath complain\n    about the punishment of their\
      \ sins? \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Let us test and examine our ways,\n    and return to the Lord.\n"
    41: "⁴¹ Let us lift up our hearts as well as our hands\n    to God in heaven.\n"

    52: "⁵² Those who were my enemies without cause\n    have hunted me like a bird;\n"
    53: "⁵³ they flung me alive into a pit\n    and hurled stones on me;\n"
    54: "⁵⁴ water closed over my head;\n    I said, “I am lost.” \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ I called on your name, O Lord,\n    from the depths of the pit;\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ you heard my plea, “Do not close your ear\n    to my cry for help, but\
      \ give me relief!”\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ You came near when I called on you;\n    you said, “Do not fear!” \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ You have taken up my cause, O Lord,\n    you have redeemed my life.\n"

  4:
    1: "¹ How the gold has grown dim,\n    how the pure gold is changed!\nThe sacred\
      \ stones lie scattered\n    at the head of every street. \n"
    2: "² The precious children of Zion,\n    worth their weight in fine gold—\nhow\
      \ they are reckoned as earthen pots,\n    the work of a potter’s hands! \n"
    3: "³ Even the jackals offer the breast\n    and nurse their young,\nbut my people\
      \ has become cruel,\n    like the ostriches in the wilderness. \n"
    4: "⁴ The tongue of the infant sticks\n    to the roof of its mouth for thirst;\n\
      the children beg for food,\n    but no one gives them anything. \n"
    5: "⁵ Those who feasted on delicacies\n    perish in the streets;\nthose who were\
      \ brought up in purple\n    cling to ash heaps. \n"
    6: "⁶ For the chastisement of my people has been greater\n    than the punishment\
      \ of Sodom,\nwhich was overthrown in a moment,\n    though no hand was laid\
      \ on it. \n"
    7: "⁷ Her princes were purer than snow,\n    whiter than milk;\ntheir bodies were\
      \ more ruddy than coral,\n    their hair like sapphire. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now their visage is blacker than soot;\n    they are not recognized in the\
      \ streets.\nTheir skin has shriveled on their bones;\n    it has become as dry\
      \ as wood. \n"
    9: "⁹ Happier were those pierced by the sword\n    than those pierced by hunger,\n\
      whose life drains away, deprived\n    of the produce of the field. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The hands of compassionate women\n    have boiled their own children;\n\
      they became their food\n    in the destruction of my people. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord gave full vent to his wrath;\n    he poured out his hot anger,\n\
      and kindled a fire in Zion\n    that consumed its foundations. \n"

      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ It was for the sins of her prophets\n    and the iniquities of her priests,\n\

    14: "¹⁴ Blindly they wandered through the streets,\n    so defiled with blood\n\
      that no one was able\n    to touch their garments. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Away! Unclean!” people shouted at them;\n    “Away! Away! Do not touch!”\n\
      So they became fugitives and wanderers;\n    it was said among the nations,\n\
      \    “They shall stay here no longer.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord himself has scattered them,\n    he will regard them no more;\n\
      no honor was shown to the priests,\n    no favor to the elders. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Our eyes failed, ever watching\n    vainly for help;\nwe were watching\
      \ eagerly\n    for a nation that could not save. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ They dogged our steps\n    so that we could not walk in our streets;\n\
      our end drew near; our days were numbered;\n    for our end had come. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Our pursuers were swifter\n    than the eagles in the heavens;\nthey chased\
      \ us on the mountains,\n    they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The Lord’s anointed, the breath of our life,\n    was taken in their pits—\n\
      the one of whom we said, “Under his shadow\n    we shall live among the nations.”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter Edom,\n    you that live in the land of\
      \ Uz;\nbut to you also the cup shall pass;\n    you shall become drunk and strip\
      \ yourself bare. \n"
    22: "²² The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter Zion, is accomplished,\n \
      \   he will keep you in exile no longer;\nbut your iniquity, O daughter Edom,\
