Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem\
      \ in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. \n"
    2: "² Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth;\n    for the Lord has spoken:\nI reared\
      \ children and brought them up,\n    but they have rebelled against me.\n"
    3: "³ The ox knows its owner,\n    and the donkey its master’s crib;\nbut Israel\
      \ does not know,\n    my people do not understand. \n"
    4: "⁴ Ah, sinful nation,\n    people laden with iniquity,\noffspring who do evil,\n\
      \    children who deal corruptly,\nwho have forsaken the Lord,\n    who have\
      \ despised the Holy One of Israel,\n    who are utterly estranged! \n"
    5: "⁵ Why do you seek further beatings?\n    Why do you continue to rebel?\nThe\
      \ whole head is sick,\n    and the whole heart faint.\n"
    6: "⁶ From the sole of the foot even to the head,\n    there is no soundness in\
      \ it,\nbut bruises and sores\n    and bleeding wounds;\nthey have not been drained,\
      \ or bound up,\n    or softened with oil. \n"
    7: "⁷ Your country lies desolate,\n    your cities are burned with fire;\nin your\
      \ very presence\n    aliens devour your land;\n    it is desolate, as overthrown\
      \ by foreigners.\n"
    8: "⁸ And daughter Zion is left\n    like a booth in a vineyard,\nlike a shelter\
      \ in a cucumber field,\n    like a besieged city.\n"
    9: "⁹ If the Lord of hosts\n    had not left us a few survivors,\nwe would have\
      \ been like Sodom,\n    and become like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord,\n    you rulers of Sodom!\nListen to the teaching\
      \ of our God,\n    you people of Gomorrah!\n"
    11: "¹¹ What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?\n    says the Lord;\n\
      I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\n    and the fat of fed beasts;\n\
      I do not delight in the blood of bulls,\n    or of lambs, or of goats. \n"
    12: "¹² When you come to appear before me,\n    who asked this from your hand?\n\
      \    Trample my courts no more;\n"
    13: "¹³ bringing offerings is futile;\n    incense is an abomination to me.\n\
      New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation—\n    I cannot endure solemn\
      \ assemblies with iniquity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your new moons and your appointed festivals\n    my soul hates;\nthey\
      \ have become a burden to me,\n    I am weary of bearing them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ When you stretch out your hands,\n    I will hide my eyes from you;\n\
      even though you make many prayers,\n    I will not listen;\n    your hands are\
      \ full of blood.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;\n    remove the evil of your doings\n\
      \    from before my eyes;\ncease to do evil,\n"
    17: "¹⁷     learn to do good;\nseek justice,\n    rescue the oppressed,\ndefend\
      \ the orphan,\n    plead for the widow. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Come now, let us argue it out,\n    says the Lord:\nthough your sins are\
      \ like scarlet,\n    they shall be like snow;\nthough they are red like crimson,\n\
      \    they shall become like wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you are willing and obedient,\n    you shall eat the good of the land;\n"
    20: "²⁰ but if you refuse and rebel,\n    you shall be devoured by the sword;\n\
      \    for the mouth of the Lord has spoken. \n"
    21: "²¹ How the faithful city\n    has become a whore!\n    She that was full\
      \ of justice,\nrighteousness lodged in her—\n    but now murderers!\n"
    22: "²² Your silver has become dross,\n    your wine is mixed with water.\n"
    23: "²³ Your princes are rebels\n    and companions of thieves.\nEveryone loves\
      \ a bribe\n    and runs after gifts.\nThey do not defend the orphan,\n    and\
      \ the widow’s cause does not come before them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore says the Sovereign, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel:\n\
      Ah, I will pour out my wrath on my enemies,\n    and avenge myself on my foes!\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will turn my hand against you;\n    I will smelt away your dross as\
      \ with lye\n    and remove all your alloy.\n"
    26: "²⁶ And I will restore your judges as at the first,\n    and your counselors\
      \ as at the beginning.\nAfterward you shall be called the city of righteousness,\n\
      \    the faithful city. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion shall be redeemed by justice,\n    and those in her who repent, by\
      \ righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together,\n    and those who\
      \ forsake the Lord shall be consumed.\n"
    29: "²⁹ For you shall be ashamed of the oaks\n    in which you delighted;\nand\
      \ you shall blush for the gardens\n    that you have chosen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For you shall be like an oak\n    whose leaf withers,\n    and like a\
      \ garden without water.\n"
    31: "³¹ The strong shall become like tinder,\n    and their work like a spark;\n\
      they and their work shall burn together,\n    with no one to quench them."
  2:
    1: "¹ The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. \n"
    2: "² In days to come\n    the mountain of the Lord’s house\nshall be established\
      \ as the highest of the mountains,\n    and shall be raised above the hills;\n\
      all the nations shall stream to it.\n"
    3: "³     Many peoples shall come and say,\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\n    to the house of the God of Jacob;\nthat he may teach us\
      \ his ways\n    and that we may walk in his paths.”\nFor out of Zion shall go\
      \ forth instruction,\n    and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ He shall judge between the nations,\n    and shall arbitrate for many peoples;\n\
      they shall beat their swords into plowshares,\n    and their spears into pruning\
      \ hooks;\nnation shall not lift up sword against nation,\n    neither shall\
      \ they learn war any more. \n"
    5: "⁵ O house of Jacob,\n    come, let us walk\n    in the light of the Lord!\n"
    6: "⁶ For you have forsaken the ways of your people,\n    O house of Jacob.\n\
      Indeed they are full of diviners from the east\n    and of soothsayers like\
      \ the Philistines,\n    and they clasp hands with foreigners.\n"
    7: "⁷ Their land is filled with silver and gold,\n    and there is no end to their\
      \ treasures;\ntheir land is filled with horses,\n    and there is no end to\
      \ their chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land is filled with idols;\n    they bow down to the work of their\
      \ hands,\n    to what their own fingers have made.\n"
    9: "⁹ And so people are humbled,\n    and everyone is brought low—\n    do not\
      \ forgive them!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Enter into the rock,\n    and hide in the dust\nfrom the terror of the\
      \ Lord,\n    and from the glory of his majesty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The haughty eyes of people shall be brought low,\n    and the pride of\
      \ everyone shall be humbled;\nand the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.\n"
    12: "¹² For the Lord of hosts has a day\n    against all that is proud and lofty,\n\
      \    against all that is lifted up and high;\n"
    13: "¹³ against all the cedars of Lebanon,\n    lofty and lifted up;\n    and\
      \ against all the oaks of Bashan;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ against all the high mountains,\n    and against all the lofty hills;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ against every high tower,\n    and against every fortified wall;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ against all the ships of Tarshish,\n    and against all the beautiful\
      \ craft.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The haughtiness of people shall be humbled,\n    and the pride of everyone\
      \ shall be brought low;\n    and the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The idols shall utterly pass away.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Enter the caves of the rocks\n    and the holes of the ground,\nfrom the\
      \ terror of the Lord,\n    and from the glory of his majesty,\n    when he rises\
      \ to terrify the earth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ On that day people will throw away\n    to the moles and to the bats\n\
      their idols of silver and their idols of gold,\n    which they made for themselves\
      \ to worship,\n"
    21: "²¹ to enter the caverns of the rocks\n    and the clefts in the crags,\n\
      from the terror of the Lord,\n    and from the glory of his majesty,\n    when\
      \ he rises to terrify the earth.\n"
    22: "²² Turn away from mortals,\n    who have only breath in their nostrils,\n\
      \    for of what account are they?"
  3:
    1: "¹ For now the Sovereign, the Lord of hosts,\n    is taking away from Jerusalem\
      \ and from Judah\nsupport and staff—\n    all support of bread,\n    and all\
      \ support of water—\n"
    2: "² warrior and soldier,\n    judge and prophet,\n    diviner and elder,\n"
    3: "³ captain of fifty\n    and dignitary,\ncounselor and skillful magician\n\
      \    and expert enchanter.\n"
    4: "⁴ And I will make boys their princes,\n    and babes shall rule over them.\n"
    5: "⁵ The people will be oppressed,\n    everyone by another\n    and everyone\
      \ by a neighbor;\nthe youth will be insolent to the elder,\n    and the base\
      \ to the honorable. \n"
    6: "⁶ Someone will even seize a relative,\n    a member of the clan, saying,\n\
      “You have a cloak;\n    you shall be our leader,\nand this heap of ruins\n \
      \   shall be under your rule.”\n"
    7: "⁷ But the other will cry out on that day, saying,\n“I will not be a healer;\n\
      \    in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;\nyou shall not make me\n\
      \    leader of the people.”\n"
    8: "⁸ For Jerusalem has stumbled\n    and Judah has fallen,\nbecause their speech\
      \ and their deeds are against the Lord,\n    defying his glorious presence.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ The look on their faces bears witness against them;\n    they proclaim their\
      \ sin like Sodom,\n    they do not hide it.\nWoe to them!\n    For they have\
      \ brought evil on themselves.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell the innocent how fortunate they are,\n    for they shall eat the\
      \ fruit of their labors.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to the guilty! How unfortunate they are,\n    for what their hands\
      \ have done shall be done to them.\n"
    12: "¹² My people—children are their oppressors,\n    and women rule over them.\n\
      O my people, your leaders mislead you,\n    and confuse the course of your paths.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ The Lord rises to argue his case;\n    he stands to judge the peoples.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord enters into judgment\n    with the elders and princes of his\
      \ people:\nIt is you who have devoured the vineyard;\n    the spoil of the poor\
      \ is in your houses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ What do you mean by crushing my people,\n    by grinding the face of the\
      \ poor? says the Lord God of hosts. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord said:\nBecause the daughters of Zion are haughty\n    and walk\
      \ with outstretched necks,\n    glancing wantonly with their eyes,\nmincing\
      \ along as they go,\n    tinkling with their feet;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ the Lord will afflict with scabs\n    the heads of the daughters of Zion,\n\
      \    and the Lord will lay bare their secret parts. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands,
      and the crescents; '
    19: '¹⁹ the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarfs; '
    20: '²⁰ the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets; '
    21: '²¹ the signet rings and nose rings; '
    22: '²² the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags; '
    23: "²³ the garments of gauze, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Instead of perfume there will be a stench;\n    and instead of a sash,\
      \ a rope;\nand instead of well-set hair, baldness;\n    and instead of a rich\
      \ robe, a binding of sackcloth;\n    instead of beauty, shame.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your men shall fall by the sword\n    and your warriors in battle.\n"
    26: "²⁶ And her gates shall lament and mourn;\n    ravaged, she shall sit upon\
      \ the ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,\n“We will eat\
      \ our own bread and wear our own clothes;\njust let us be called by your name;\n\
      \    take away our disgrace.” \n"
    2: '² On that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious, and
      the fruit of the land shall be the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel. '
    3: '³ Whoever is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone
      who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem, '
    4: '⁴ once the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed
      the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a
      spirit of burning. '
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over its
      places of assembly a cloud by day and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire
      by night. Indeed over all the glory there will be a canopy. '
    6: ⁶ It will serve as a pavilion, a shade by day from the heat, and a refuge and
      a shelter from the storm and rain.
  5:
    1: "¹ Let me sing for my beloved\n    my love-song concerning his vineyard:\n\
      My beloved had a vineyard\n    on a very fertile hill.\n"
    2: "² He dug it and cleared it of stones,\n    and planted it with choice vines;\n\
      he built a watchtower in the midst of it,\n    and hewed out a wine vat in it;\n\
      he expected it to yield grapes,\n    but it yielded wild grapes. \n"
    3: "³ And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem\n    and people of Judah,\njudge between\
      \ me\n    and my vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What more was there to do for my vineyard\n    that I have not done in it?\n\
      When I expected it to yield grapes,\n    why did it yield wild grapes? \n"
    5: "⁵ And now I will tell you\n    what I will do to my vineyard.\nI will remove\
      \ its hedge,\n    and it shall be devoured;\nI will break down its wall,\n \
      \   and it shall be trampled down.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will make it a waste;\n    it shall not be pruned or hoed,\n    and it\
      \ shall be overgrown with briers and thorns;\nI will also command the clouds\n\
      \    that they rain no rain upon it. \n"
    7: "⁷ For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts\n    is the house of Israel,\nand\
      \ the people of Judah\n    are his pleasant planting;\nhe expected justice,\n\
      \    but saw bloodshed;\nrighteousness,\n    but heard a cry! \n"
    8: "⁸ Ah, you who join house to house,\n    who add field to field,\nuntil there\
      \ is room for no one but you,\n    and you are left to live alone\n    in the\
      \ midst of the land!\n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord of hosts has sworn in my hearing:\nSurely many houses shall be\
      \ desolate,\n    large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath,\n    and a homer of\
      \ seed shall yield a mere ephah. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Ah, you who rise early in the morning\n    in pursuit of strong drink,\n\
      who linger in the evening\n    to be inflamed by wine,\n"
    12: "¹² whose feasts consist of lyre and harp,\n    tambourine and flute and wine,\n\
      but who do not regard the deeds of the Lord,\n    or see the work of his hands!\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore my people go into exile without knowledge;\ntheir nobles are\
      \ dying of hunger,\n    and their multitude is parched with thirst. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite\n    and opened its mouth beyond\
      \ measure;\nthe nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down,\n    her throng\
      \ and all who exult in her.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ People are bowed down, everyone is brought low,\n    and the eyes of the\
      \ haughty are humbled.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But the Lord of hosts is exalted by justice,\n    and the Holy God shows\
      \ himself holy by righteousness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then the lambs shall graze as in their pasture,\n    fatlings and kids\
      \ shall feed among the ruins. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Ah, you who drag iniquity along with cords of falsehood,\n    who drag\
      \ sin along as with cart ropes,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ who say, “Let him make haste,\n    let him speed his work\n    that we\
      \ may see it;\nlet the plan of the Holy One of Israel hasten to fulfillment,\n\
      \    that we may know it!”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Ah, you who call evil good\n    and good evil,\nwho put darkness for light\n\
      \    and light for darkness,\nwho put bitter for sweet\n    and sweet for bitter!\n"
    21: "²¹ Ah, you who are wise in your own eyes,\n    and shrewd in your own sight!\n"
    22: "²² Ah, you who are heroes in drinking wine\n    and valiant at mixing drink,\n"
    23: "²³ who acquit the guilty for a bribe,\n    and deprive the innocent of their\
      \ rights! \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,\n    and as dry\
      \ grass sinks down in the flame,\nso their root will become rotten,\n    and\
      \ their blossom go up like dust;\nfor they have rejected the instruction of\
      \ the Lord of hosts,\n    and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people,\n    and\
      \ he stretched out his hand against them and struck them;\n    the mountains\
      \ quaked,\nand their corpses were like refuse\n    in the streets.\nFor all\
      \ this his anger has not turned away,\n    and his hand is stretched out still.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ He will raise a signal for a nation far away,\n    and whistle for a people\
      \ at the ends of the earth;\nHere they come, swiftly, speedily!\n"
    27: "²⁷ None of them is weary, none stumbles,\n    none slumbers or sleeps,\n\
      not a loincloth is loose,\n    not a sandal-thong broken;\n"
    28: "²⁸ their arrows are sharp,\n    all their bows bent,\ntheir horses’ hoofs\
      \ seem like flint,\n    and their wheels like the whirlwind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Their roaring is like a lion,\n    like young lions they roar;\nthey growl\
      \ and seize their prey,\n    they carry it off, and no one can rescue.\n"
    30: "³⁰ They will roar over it on that day,\n    like the roaring of the sea.\n\
      And if one look to the land—\n    only darkness and distress;\nand the light\
      \ grows dark with clouds."
  6:
    1: '¹ In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high
      and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. '
    2: '² Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they
      covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they
      flew. '
    3: "³ And one called to another and said:\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;\n\
      the whole earth is full of his glory.” \n"
    4: '⁴ The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and
      the house filled with smoke. '
    5: "⁵ And I said: “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I\
      \ live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord\
      \ of hosts!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken
      from the altar with a pair of tongs. '
    7: '⁷ The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: “Now that this has touched
      your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.” '
    8: '⁸ Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will
      go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me!” '
    9: "⁹ And he said, “Go and say to this people:\n‘Keep listening, but do not comprehend;\n\
      keep looking, but do not understand.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Make the mind of this people dull,\n    and stop their ears,\n    and\
      \ shut their eyes,\nso that they may not look with their eyes,\n    and listen\
      \ with their ears,\nand comprehend with their minds,\n    and turn and be healed.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “How long, O Lord?” And he said:\n“Until cities lie waste\n\
      \    without inhabitant,\nand houses without people,\n    and the land is utterly\
      \ desolate;\n"
    12: "¹² until the Lord sends everyone far away,\n    and vast is the emptiness\
      \ in the midst of the land.\n"
    13: "¹³ Even if a tenth part remain in it,\n    it will be burned again,\nlike\
      \ a terebinth or an oak\n    whose stump remains standing\n    when it is felled.”\n\
      The holy seed is its stump."
  7:
    1: '¹ In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin
      of Aram and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel went up to attack Jerusalem,
      but could not mount an attack against it. '
    2: "² When the house of David heard that Aram had allied itself with Ephraim,\
      \ the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest\
      \ shake before the wind. \n"
    3: '³ Then the Lord said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub,
      at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller’s Field, '
    4: '⁴ and say to him, Take heed, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart
      be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, because of the
      fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Because Aram—with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah—has plotted evil against
      you, saying, '
    6: '⁶ Let us go up against Judah and cut off Jerusalem and conquer it for ourselves
      and make the son of Tabeel king in it; '
    7: "⁷ therefore thus says the Lord God:\nIt shall not stand,\n    and it shall\
      \ not come to pass.\n"
    8: "⁸ For the head of Aram is Damascus,\n    and the head of Damascus is Rezin.\n\
      (Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered, no longer a people.) \n"
    9: "⁹ The head of Ephraim is Samaria,\n    and the head of Samaria is the son\

    10: '¹⁰ Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, saying, '
    11: '¹¹ Ask a sign of the Lord your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. '
    12: '¹² But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test. '
    13: '¹³ Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you
      to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman
      is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel. '
    15: '¹⁵ He shall eat curds and honey by the time he knows how to refuse the evil
      and choose the good. '
    16: '¹⁶ For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good,
      the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted. '
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord will bring on you and on your people and on your ancestral house\
      \ such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the\
      \ king of Assyria.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ On that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is at the sources of
      the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. '
    19: "¹⁹ And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts\
      \ of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. \n"
    20: "²⁰ On that day the Lord will shave with a razor hired beyond the River—with\
      \ the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will take off\
      \ the beard as well. \n"
    21: '²¹ On that day one will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, '
    22: "²² and will eat curds because of the abundance of milk that they give; for\
      \ everyone that is left in the land shall eat curds and honey. \n"
    23: '²³ On that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth
      a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns. '
    24: '²⁴ With bow and arrows one will go there, for all the land will be briers
      and thorns; '
    25: ²⁵ and as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not
      go there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where cattle
      are let loose and where sheep tread.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me, Take a large tablet and write on it in common
      characters, “Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz,” '
    2: '² and have it attested for me by reliable witnesses, the priest Uriah and
      Zechariah son of Jeberechiah. '
    3: '³ And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the

    4: "⁴ for before the child knows how to call “My father” or “My mother,” the wealth\
      \ of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ The Lord spoke to me again: '
    6: '⁶ Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently,
      and melt in fear before Rezin and the son of Remaliah; '
    7: '⁷ therefore, the Lord is bringing up against it the mighty flood waters of
      the River, the king of Assyria and all his glory; it will rise above all its
      channels and overflow all its banks; '
    8: "⁸ it will sweep on into Judah as a flood, and, pouring over, it will reach\

      \ O Immanuel. \n"
    9: "⁹ Band together, you peoples, and be dismayed;\n    listen, all you far countries;\n\
      gird yourselves and be dismayed;\n    gird yourselves and be dismayed!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Take counsel together, but it shall be brought to naught;\n    speak a\
      \ word, but it will not stand,\n    for God is with us. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the Lord spoke thus to me while his hand was strong upon me, and warned
      me not to walk in the way of this people, saying: '
    12: '¹² Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not
      fear what it fears, or be in dread. '
    13: '¹³ But the Lord of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your fear,
      and let him be your dread. '
    14: '¹⁴ He will become a sanctuary, a stone one strikes against; for both houses
      of Israel he will become a rock one stumbles over—a trap and a snare for the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    15: "¹⁵ And many among them shall stumble; they shall fall and be broken; they\
      \ shall be snared and taken. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples. '
    17: '¹⁷ I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob,
      and I will hope in him. '
    18: '¹⁸ See, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and portents

    19: '¹⁹ Now if people say to you, “Consult the ghosts and the familiar spirits

    20: '²⁰ for teaching and for instruction?” surely, those who speak like this will
      have no dawn! '
    21: '²¹ They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry; when they
      are hungry, they will be enraged and will curse their king and their gods. They

  9:
    1: "¹ But there will be no gloom for those who were in anguish. In the former\

    2: "² The people who walked in darkness\n    have seen a great light;\nthose who\

    13: "¹³ The people did not turn to him who struck them,\n    or seek the Lord\

    18: "¹⁸ For wickedness burned like a fire,\n    consuming briers and thorns;\n\
      it kindled the thickets of the forest,\n    and they swirled upward in a column\

      \    you will be beaten down by it.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ As often as it passes through, it will take you;\n    for morning by morning\
      \ it will pass through,\n    by day and by night;\nand it will be sheer terror\
      \ to understand the message.\n"
    20: "²⁰ For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it,\n    and the covering\
      \ too narrow to wrap oneself in it.\n"
    21: "²¹ For the Lord will rise up as on Mount Perazim,\n    he will rage as in\
      \ the valley of Gibeon\nto do his deed—strange is his deed!—\n    and to work\
      \ his work—alien is his work!\n"
    22: "²² Now therefore do not scoff,\n    or your bonds will be made stronger;\n\

    25: "²⁵ When they have leveled its surface,\n    do they not scatter dill, sow\
      \ cummin,\nand plant wheat in rows\n    and barley in its proper place,\n  \
      \  and spelt as the border?\n"
    26: "²⁶ For they are well instructed;\n    their God teaches them. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,\n    nor is a cart wheel\
      \ rolled over cummin;\nbut dill is beaten out with a stick,\n    and cummin\
      \ with a rod.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Grain is crushed for bread,\n    but one does not thresh it forever;\n\
      one drives the cart wheel and horses over it,\n    but does not pulverize it.\n"
    29: "²⁹ This also comes from the Lord of hosts;\n    he is wonderful in counsel,\n\

    2: "² Yet I will distress Ariel,\n    and there shall be moaning and lamentation,\n\

    3: "³ And like David I will encamp against you;\n    I will besiege you with towers\n\

    4: "⁴ Then deep from the earth you shall speak,\n    from low in the dust your\

      \ a ghost,\n    and your speech shall whisper out of the dust. \n"
    5: "⁵ But the multitude of your foes shall be like small dust,\n    and the multitude\

    7: "⁷ And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,\n    all\
      \ that fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her,\n    shall\
      \ be like a dream, a vision of the night.\n"
    8: "⁸ Just as when a hungry person dreams of eating\n    and wakes up still hungry,\n\
      or a thirsty person dreams of drinking\n    and wakes up faint, still thirsty,\n\
      so shall the multitude of all the nations be\n    that fight against Mount Zion.\

    9: "⁹ Stupefy yourselves and be in a stupor,\n    blind yourselves and be blind!\n\

    11: '¹¹ The vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document.

    12: "¹² And if it is given to those who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” they\

    13: "¹³ The Lord said:\nBecause these people draw near with their mouths\n   \
      \ and honor me with their lips,\n    while their hearts are far from me,\nand\
      \ their worship of me is a human commandment learned by rote;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ so I will again do\n    amazing things with this people,\n    shocking\
      \ and amazing.\nThe wisdom of their wise shall perish,\n    and the discernment\

    15: "¹⁵ Ha! You who hide a plan too deep for the Lord,\n    whose deeds are in\
      \ the dark,\n    and who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You turn things upside down!\n    Shall the potter be regarded as the\

    17: "¹⁷ Shall not Lebanon in a very little while\n    become a fruitful field,\n\

    18: "¹⁸ On that day the deaf shall hear\n    the words of a scroll,\nand out of\

    19: "¹⁹ The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the Lord,\n    and the neediest people\
      \ shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    20: "²⁰ For the tyrant shall be no more,\n    and the scoffer shall cease to be;\n\
      \    all those alert to do evil shall be cut off—\n"
    21: "²¹ those who cause a person to lose a lawsuit,\n    who set a trap for the\
      \ arbiter in the gate,\n    and without grounds deny justice to the one in the\
      \ right. \n"
    22: "²² Therefore thus says the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house\

      \ grow pale.\n"
    23: "²³ For when he sees his children,\n    the work of my hands, in his midst,\n\

      \    and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\n"
    24: "²⁴ And those who err in spirit will come to understanding,\n    and those\

  30:
    1: "¹ Oh, rebellious children, says the Lord,\nwho carry out a plan, but not mine;\n\
      who make an alliance, but against my will,\n    adding sin to sin;\n"
    2: "² who set out to go down to Egypt\n    without asking for my counsel,\nto\
      \ take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh,\n    and to seek shelter in the\

    3: "³ Therefore the protection of Pharaoh shall become your shame,\n    and the\

    5: "⁵ everyone comes to shame\n    through a people that cannot profit them,\n\
      that brings neither help nor profit,\n    but shame and disgrace. \n"
    6: "⁶ An oracle concerning the animals of the Negeb.\nThrough a land of trouble\

    7: "⁷ For Egypt’s help is worthless and empty,\n    therefore I have called her,\n\

    8: "⁸ Go now, write it before them on a tablet,\n    and inscribe it in a book,\n\

    9: "⁹ For they are a rebellious people,\n    faithless children,\nchildren who\

    11: "¹¹ leave the way, turn aside from the path,\n    let us hear no more about\
      \ the Holy One of Israel.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel:\nBecause you reject this word,\n\
      \    and put your trust in oppression and deceit,\n    and rely on them;\n"
    13: "¹³ therefore this iniquity shall become for you\n    like a break in a high\
      \ wall, bulging out, and about to collapse,\n    whose crash comes suddenly,\
      \ in an instant;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ its breaking is like that of a potter’s vessel\n    that is smashed so\
      \ ruthlessly\nthat among its fragments not a sherd is found\n    for taking\
      \ fire from the hearth,\n    or dipping water out of the cistern. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For thus said the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel:\nIn returning and\
      \ rest you shall be saved;\n    in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.\n\
      But you refused "
    16: "¹⁶ and said,\n“No! We will flee upon horses”—\n    therefore you shall flee!\n\
      and, “We will ride upon swift steeds”—\n    therefore your pursuers shall be\
      \ swift!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ A thousand shall flee at the threat of one,\n    at the threat of five\
      \ you shall flee,\nuntil you are left\n    like a flagstaff on the top of a\
      \ mountain,\n    like a signal on a hill. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you;\n    therefore he will\
      \ rise up to show mercy to you.\nFor the Lord is a God of justice;\n    blessed\
      \ are all those who wait for him. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Truly, O people in Zion, inhabitants of Jerusalem, you shall weep no more.
      He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it,
      he will answer you. '
    20: '²⁰ Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction,
      yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your
      Teacher. '
    21: '²¹ And when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left, your ears
      shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” '
    22: "²² Then you will defile your silver-covered idols and your gold-plated images.\
      \ You will scatter them like filthy rags; you will say to them, “Away with you!”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ He will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and grain,
      the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. On that day your
      cattle will graze in broad pastures; '
    24: '²⁴ and the oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat silage, which has
      been winnowed with shovel and fork. '
    25: '²⁵ On every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running
      with water—on a day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. '
    26: "²⁶ Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and\
      \ the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the\
      \ day when the Lord binds up the injuries of his people, and heals the wounds\
      \ inflicted by his blow. \n"
    27: "²⁷ See, the name of the Lord comes from far away,\n    burning with his anger,\
      \ and in thick rising smoke;\nhis lips are full of indignation,\n    and his\
      \ tongue is like a devouring fire;\n"
    28: "²⁸ his breath is like an overflowing stream\n    that reaches up to the neck—\n\
      to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction,\n    and to place on the\
      \ jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads them astray. \n"
    29: '²⁹ You shall have a song as in the night when a holy festival is kept; and
      gladness of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the
      mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel. '
    30: '³⁰ And the Lord will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending
      blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire,
      with a cloudburst and tempest and hailstones. '
    31: '³¹ The Assyrian will be terror-stricken at the voice of the Lord, when he
      strikes with his rod. '
    32: '³² And every stroke of the staff of punishment that the Lord lays upon him
      will be to the sound of timbrels and lyres; battling with brandished arm he
      will fight with him. '
    33: ³³ For his burning place has long been prepared; truly it is made ready for
      the king, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the
      breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
  31:
    1: "¹ Alas for those who go down to Egypt for help\n    and who rely on horses,\n\
      who trust in chariots because they are many\n    and in horsemen because they\
      \ are very strong,\nbut do not look to the Holy One of Israel\n    or consult\
      \ the Lord!\n"
    2: "² Yet he too is wise and brings disaster;\n    he does not call back his words,\n\
      but will rise against the house of the evildoers,\n    and against the helpers\
      \ of those who work iniquity.\n"
    3: "³ The Egyptians are human, and not God;\n    their horses are flesh, and not\
      \ spirit.\nWhen the Lord stretches out his hand,\n    the helper will stumble,\
      \ and the one helped will fall,\n    and they will all perish together. \n"
    4: "⁴ For thus the Lord said to me,\nAs a lion or a young lion growls over its\
      \ prey,\n    and—when a band of shepherds is called out against it—\nis not\
      \ terrified by their shouting\n    or daunted at their noise,\nso the Lord of\

    5: "⁵ Like birds hovering overhead, so the Lord of hosts\n    will protect Jerusalem;\n\
      he will protect and deliver it,\n    he will spare and rescue it. \n"
    6: '⁶ Turn back to him whom you have deeply betrayed, O people of Israel. '
    7: "⁷ For on that day all of you shall throw away your idols of silver and idols\
      \ of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Then the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of mortals;\n    and a sword,\
      \ not of humans, shall devour him;\nhe shall flee from the sword,\n    and his\
      \ young men shall be put to forced labor.\n"
    9: "⁹ His rock shall pass away in terror,\n    and his officers desert the standard\
      \ in panic,”\nsays the Lord, whose fire is in Zion,\n    and whose furnace is\
      \ in Jerusalem."
  32:
    1: "¹ See, a king will reign in righteousness,\n    and princes will rule with\
      \ justice.\n"
    2: "² Each will be like a hiding place from the wind,\n    a covert from the tempest,\n\

    3: "³ Then the eyes of those who have sight will not be closed,\n    and the ears\

    4: "⁴ The minds of the rash will have good judgment,\n    and the tongues of stammerers\
      \ will speak readily and distinctly.\n"
    5: "⁵ A fool will no longer be called noble,\n    nor a villain said to be honorable.\n"
    6: "⁶ For fools speak folly,\n    and their minds plot iniquity:\nto practice\
      \ ungodliness,\n    to utter error concerning the Lord,\nto leave the craving\

    7: "⁷ The villainies of villains are evil;\n    they devise wicked devices\nto\

    8: "⁸ But those who are noble plan noble things,\n    and by noble things they\

    9: "⁹ The land mourns and languishes;\n    Lebanon is confounded and withers away;\n\

  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria came
      up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. '
    2: '² The king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at
      Jerusalem, with a great army. He stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the
      highway to the Fuller’s Field. '
    3: "³ And there came out to him Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the\
      \ palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder. \n"
    4: '⁴ The Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah: Thus says the great king,
      the king of Assyria: On what do you base this confidence of yours? '
    5: '⁵ Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On whom do
      you now rely, that you have rebelled against me? '
    6: '⁶ See, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce
      the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who
      rely on him. '
    7: '⁷ But if you say to me, ‘We rely on the Lord our God,’ is it not he whose
      high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem,
      ‘You shall worship before this altar’? '
    8: '⁸ Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you
      two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. '
    9: '⁹ How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master’s
      servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? '
    10: "¹⁰ Moreover, is it without the Lord that I have come up against this land\
      \ to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to
      your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language
      of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” '
    12: "¹² But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to\
      \ your master and to you, and not to the people sitting on the wall, who are\
      \ doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language
      of Judah, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! '
    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not
      be able to deliver you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the Lord by saying, The Lord will
      surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of
      Assyria.’ '
    16: '¹⁶ Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make your
      peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat from your own
      vine and your own fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, '
    17: '¹⁷ until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
      grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. '
    18: '¹⁸ Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, The Lord will save us. Has
      any of the gods of the nations saved their land out of the hand of the king
      of Assyria? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
      Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? '
    20: "²⁰ Who among all the gods of these countries have saved their countries out\
      \ of my hand, that the Lord should save Jerusalem out of my hand?’” \n"
    21: '²¹ But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s command
      was, “Do not answer him.” '
    22: ²² Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna
      the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their
      clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
  37:
    1: '¹ When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth,
      and went into the house of the Lord. '
    2: '² And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary,
      and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of
      Amoz. '
    3: '³ They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of
      rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength
      to bring them forth. '
    4: "⁴ It may be that the Lord your God heard the words of the Rabshakeh, whom\
      \ his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke\
      \ the words that the Lord your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer\
      \ for the remnant that is left.” \n"
    5: '⁵ When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, '
    6: '⁶ Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: Do not be
      afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of
      the king of Assyria have reviled me. '
    7: "⁷ I myself will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor, and return\
      \ to his own land; I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah;
      for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. '
    9: '⁹ Now the king heard concerning King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, “He has set out
      to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus shall you speak to King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God on
      whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into
      the hand of the king of Assyria. '
    11: '¹¹ See, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands,
      destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered? '
    12: '¹² Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my predecessors
      destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? '
    13: "¹³ Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of\
      \ Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read
      it; then Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord and spread it before the
      Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying: '
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim,
      you are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven
      and earth. '
    17: '¹⁷ Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; hear
      all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. '
    18: '¹⁸ Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and
      their lands, '
    19: '¹⁹ and have hurled their gods into the fire, though they were no gods, but
      the work of human hands—wood and stone—and so they were destroyed. '
    20: "²⁰ So now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms\
      \ of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying: “Thus says the Lord,
      the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning King Sennacherib
      of Assyria, '
    22: "²² this is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him:\nShe despises\
      \ you, she scorns you—\n    virgin daughter Zion;\nshe tosses her head—behind\
      \ your back,\n    daughter Jerusalem. \n"
    23: "²³ “Whom have you mocked and reviled?\n    Against whom have you raised your\
      \ voice\nand haughtily lifted your eyes?\n    Against the Holy One of Israel!\n"
    24: "²⁴ By your servants you have mocked the Lord,\n    and you have said, ‘With\
      \ my many chariots\nI have gone up the heights of the mountains,\n    to the\
      \ far recesses of Lebanon;\nI felled its tallest cedars,\n    its choicest cypresses;\n\
      I came to its remotest height,\n    its densest forest.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I dug wells\n    and drank waters,\nI dried up with the sole of my foot\n\
      \    all the streams of Egypt.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “Have you not heard\n    that I determined it long ago?\nI planned from\
      \ days of old\n    what now I bring to pass,\nthat you should make fortified\
      \ cities\n    crash into heaps of ruins,\n"
    27: "²⁷ while their inhabitants, shorn of strength,\n    are dismayed and confounded;\n\
      they have become like plants of the field\n    and like tender grass,\nlike\
      \ grass on the housetops,\n    blighted before it is grown. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “I know your rising up and your sitting down,\n    your going out and\
      \ coming in,\n    and your raging against me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because you have raged against me\n    and your arrogance has come to\
      \ my ears,\nI will put my hook in your nose\n    and my bit in your mouth;\n\
      I will turn you back on the way\n    by which you came. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “And this shall be the sign for you: This year eat what grows of itself,
      and in the second year what springs from that; then in the third year sow, reap,
      plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. '
    31: '³¹ The surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward,
      and bear fruit upward; '
    32: "³² for from Jerusalem a remnant shall go out, and from Mount Zion a band\
      \ of survivors. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. \n"
    33: '³³ “Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall
      not come into this city, shoot an arrow there, come before it with a shield,
      or cast up a siege ramp against it. '
    34: '³⁴ By the way that he came, by the same he shall return; he shall not come
      into this city, says the Lord. '
    35: "³⁵ For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake\
      \ of my servant David.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Then the angel of the Lord set out and struck down one hundred eighty-five
      thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; when morning dawned, they were all dead
      bodies. '
    37: '³⁷ Then King Sennacherib of Assyria left, went home, and lived at Nineveh. '
    38: ³⁸ As he was worshiping in the house of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech
      and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
      His son Esar-haddon succeeded him.
  38:
    1: '¹ In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet
      Isaiah son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: Set your
      house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.” '
    2: '² Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord: '
    3: "³ “Remember now, O Lord, I implore you, how I have walked before you in faithfulness\
      \ with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah\
      \ wept bitterly. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: '
    5: '⁵ “Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of your ancestor David:
      I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to

      that he has promised: '
    8: "⁸ See, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz\
      \ turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by\

    9: "⁹ A writing of King Hezekiah of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered\
      \ from his sickness: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I said: In the noontide of my days\n    I must depart;\nI am consigned\
      \ to the gates of Sheol\n    for the rest of my years.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I said, I shall not see the Lord\n    in the land of the living;\nI shall\
      \ look upon mortals no more\n    among the inhabitants of the world.\n"
    12: "¹² My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me\n    like a shepherd’s tent;\n\
      like a weaver I have rolled up my life;\n    he cuts me off from the loom;\n\
      from day to night you bring me to an end;\n"
    13: "¹³     I cry for help until morning;\nlike a lion he breaks all my bones;\n\

    14: "¹⁴ Like a swallow or a crane I clamor,\n    I moan like a dove.\nMy eyes\
      \ are weary with looking upward.\n    O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But what can I say? For he has spoken to me,\n    and he himself has done\
      \ it.\nAll my sleep has fled\n    because of the bitterness of my soul. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ O Lord, by these things people live,\n    and in all these is the life\

    17: "¹⁷ Surely it was for my welfare\n    that I had great bitterness;\nbut you\
      \ have held back my life\n    from the pit of destruction,\nfor you have cast\
      \ all my sins\n    behind your back.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For Sheol cannot thank you,\n    death cannot praise you;\nthose who go\
      \ down to the Pit cannot hope\n    for your faithfulness.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The living, the living, they thank you,\n    as I do this day;\nfathers\

    20: "²⁰ The Lord will save me,\n    and we will sing to stringed instruments\n\

    21: '²¹ Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a lump of figs, and apply it to the
      boil, so that he may recover.” '
    22: ²² Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house
      of the Lord?”
  39:
    1: '¹ At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys
      with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and
      had recovered. '
    2: '² Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the
      gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in
      his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah
      did not show them. '
    3: '³ Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did
      these men say? From where did they come to you?” Hezekiah answered, “They have
      come to me from a far country, from Babylon.” '
    4: "⁴ He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have\
      \ seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did\
      \ not show them.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: '
    6: '⁶ Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors
      have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be
      left, says the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall
      be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” '
    8: ⁸ Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord that you have spoken
      is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my days.”
  40:

    6: "⁶ A voice says, “Cry out!”\n    And I said, “What shall I cry?”\nAll people\

    7: "⁷ The grass withers, the flower fades,\n    when the breath of the Lord blows\

    2: "² Look to Abraham your father\n    and to Sarah who bore you;\nfor he was\
      \ but one when I called him,\n    but I blessed him and made him many.\n"
    3: "³ For the Lord will comfort Zion;\n    he will comfort all her waste places,\n\

    4: "⁴ Listen to me, my people,\n    and give heed to me, my nation;\nfor a teaching\

    6: "⁶ Lift up your eyes to the heavens,\n    and look at the earth beneath;\n\

    8: "⁸ For the moth will eat them up like a garment,\n    and the worm will eat\

      \ to all generations. \n"
    9: "⁹ Awake, awake, put on strength,\n    O arm of the Lord!\nAwake, as in days\
      \ of old,\n    the generations of long ago!\nWas it not you who cut Rahab in\
      \ pieces,\n    who pierced the dragon?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Was it not you who dried up the sea,\n    the waters of the great deep;\n\
      who made the depths of the sea a way\n    for the redeemed to cross over?\n"
    11: "¹¹ So the ransomed of the Lord shall return,\n    and come to Zion with singing;\n\
      everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;\n    they shall obtain joy and gladness,\n\

      \    because of the fury of the oppressor,\nwho is bent on destruction.\n  \
      \  But where is the fury of the oppressor?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The oppressed shall speedily be released;\n    they shall not die and\

    21: "²¹ Therefore hear this, you who are wounded,\n    who are drunk, but not\
      \ with wine:\n"
    22: "²² Thus says your Sovereign, the Lord,\n    your God who pleads the cause\
      \ of his people:\nSee, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering;\n\
      you shall drink no more\n    from the bowl of my wrath.\n"
    23: "²³ And I will put it into the hand of your tormentors,\n    who have said\
      \ to you,\n    “Bow down, that we may walk on you”;\nand you have made your\
      \ back like the ground\n    and like the street for them to walk on."
  52:
    1: "¹ Awake, awake,\n    put on your strength, O Zion!\nPut on your beautiful\

    3: '³ For thus says the Lord: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed

    4: '⁴ For thus says the Lord God: Long ago, my people went down into Egypt to
      reside there as aliens; the Assyrian, too, has oppressed them without cause. '
    5: '⁵ Now therefore what am I doing here, says the Lord, seeing that my people
      are taken away without cause? Their rulers howl, says the Lord, and continually,

    8: "⁸ Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices,\n    together they sing for\

    9: "⁹ Break forth together into singing,\n    you ruins of Jerusalem;\nfor the\
      \ Lord has comforted his people,\n    he has redeemed Jerusalem.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord has bared his holy arm\n    before the eyes of all the nations;\n\

    11: "¹¹ Depart, depart, go out from there!\n    Touch no unclean thing;\ngo out\

    15: "¹⁵ so he shall startle many nations;\n    kings shall shut their mouths because\

  53:
    1: "¹ Who has believed what we have heard?\n    And to whom has the arm of the\

    3: "³ He was despised and rejected by others;\n    a man of suffering and acquainted\

    8: "⁸ By a perversion of justice he was taken away.\n    Who could have imagined\

    9: "⁹ They made his grave with the wicked\n    and his tomb with the rich,\nalthough\

    2: "² Enlarge the site of your tent,\n    and let the curtains of your habitations\

    9: "⁹ This is like the days of Noah to me:\n    Just as I swore that the waters\

    4: "⁴ Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight\n    and to strike with a wicked\

    5: "⁵ Is such the fast that I choose,\n    a day to humble oneself?\nIs it to\

      Will you call this a fast,\n    a day acceptable to the Lord? \n"
    6: "⁶ Is not this the fast that I choose:\n    to loose the bonds of injustice,\n\
      \    to undo the thongs of the yoke,\nto let the oppressed go free,\n    and\

    7: "⁷ Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,\n    and bring the homeless\

      \ upheld him.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He put on righteousness like a breastplate,\n    and a helmet of salvation\

      \ for you.”\nThese are a smoke in my nostrils,\n    a fire that burns all day\
      \ long.\n"
    6: "⁶ See, it is written before me:\n    I will not keep silent, but I will repay;\n\
      I will indeed repay into their laps\n"
    7: "⁷     their iniquities and their ancestors’ iniquities together,\nsays the\
      \ Lord;\nbecause they offered incense on the mountains\n    and reviled me on\
      \ the hills,\nI will measure into their laps\n    full payment for their actions.\n"
    8: "⁸ Thus says the Lord:\nAs the wine is found in the cluster,\n    and they\
      \ say, “Do not destroy it,\n    for there is a blessing in it,”\nso I will do\
      \ for my servants’ sake,\n    and not destroy them all.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,\n    and from Judah inheritors\
      \ of my mountains;\nmy chosen shall inherit it,\n    and my servants shall settle\
      \ there.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks,\n    and the Valley of Achor\
      \ a place for herds to lie down,\n    for my people who have sought me.\n"
    11: "¹¹ But you who forsake the Lord,\n    who forget my holy mountain,\nwho set\
      \ a table for Fortune\n    and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;\n"
    12: "¹² I will destine you to the sword,\n    and all of you shall bow down to\
      \ the slaughter;\nbecause, when I called, you did not answer,\n    when I spoke,\
      \ you did not listen,\nbut you did what was evil in my sight,\n    and chose\
      \ what I did not delight in.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore thus says the Lord God:\nMy servants shall eat,\n    but you\
      \ shall be hungry;\nmy servants shall drink,\n    but you shall be thirsty;\n\
      my servants shall rejoice,\n    but you shall be put to shame;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ my servants shall sing for gladness of heart,\n    but you shall cry out\
      \ for pain of heart,\n    and shall wail for anguish of spirit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You shall leave your name to my chosen to use as a curse,\n    and the\
      \ Lord God will put you to death;\n    but to his servants he will give a different\
      \ name.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then whoever invokes a blessing in the land\n    shall bless by the God\
      \ of faithfulness,\nand whoever takes an oath in the land\n    shall swear by\
      \ the God of faithfulness;\nbecause the former troubles are forgotten\n    and\
      \ are hidden from my sight. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I am about to create new heavens\n    and a new earth;\nthe former\
      \ things shall not be remembered\n    or come to mind.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But be glad and rejoice forever\n    in what I am creating;\nfor I am\
      \ about to create Jerusalem as a joy,\n    and its people as a delight.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will rejoice in Jerusalem,\n    and delight in my people;\nno more shall\
      \ the sound of weeping be heard in it,\n    or the cry of distress.\n"
    20: "²⁰ No more shall there be in it\n    an infant that lives but a few days,\n\
      \    or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;\nfor one who dies at\
      \ a hundred years will be considered a youth,\n    and one who falls short of\
      \ a hundred will be considered accursed.\n"
    21: "²¹ They shall build houses and inhabit them;\n    they shall plant vineyards\
      \ and eat their fruit.\n"
    22: "²² They shall not build and another inhabit;\n    they shall not plant and\
      \ another eat;\nfor like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,\n\
      \    and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\n"
    23: "²³ They shall not labor in vain,\n    or bear children for calamity;\nfor\
      \ they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord—\n    and their descendants as\
      \ well.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Before they call I will answer,\n    while they are yet speaking I will\
      \ hear.\n"
    25: "²⁵ The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,\n    the lion shall eat straw\
      \ like the ox;\n    but the serpent—its food shall be dust!\nThey shall not\
      \ hurt or destroy\n    on all my holy mountain,\nsays the Lord."
  66:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\nHeaven is my throne\n    and the earth is my footstool;\n\
      what is the house that you would build for me,\n    and what is my resting place?\n"
    2: "² All these things my hand has made,\n    and so all these things are mine,\n\
      says the Lord.\nBut this is the one to whom I will look,\n    to the humble\
      \ and contrite in spirit,\n    who trembles at my word. \n"
    3: "³ Whoever slaughters an ox is like one who kills a human being;\n    whoever\
      \ sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog’s neck;\nwhoever presents a grain\
      \ offering, like one who offers swine’s blood;\n    whoever makes a memorial\
      \ offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol.\nThese have chosen\
      \ their own ways,\n    and in their abominations they take delight;\n"
    4: "⁴ I also will choose to mock them,\n    and bring upon them what they fear;\n\
      because, when I called, no one answered,\n    when I spoke, they did not listen;\n\
      but they did what was evil in my sight,\n    and chose what did not please me.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Hear the word of the Lord,\n    you who tremble at his word:\nYour own people\
      \ who hate you\n    and reject you for my name’s sake\nhave said, “Let the Lord\
      \ be glorified,\n    so that we may see your joy”;\n    but it is they who shall\
      \ be put to shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ Listen, an uproar from the city!\n    A voice from the temple!\nThe voice\
      \ of the Lord,\n    dealing retribution to his enemies! \n"
    7: "⁷ Before she was in labor\n    she gave birth;\nbefore her pain came upon\
      \ her\n    she delivered a son.\n"
    8: "⁸ Who has heard of such a thing?\n    Who has seen such things?\nShall a land\
      \ be born in one day?\n    Shall a nation be delivered in one moment?\nYet as\
      \ soon as Zion was in labor\n    she delivered her children.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I open the womb and not deliver?\n    says the Lord;\nshall I, the\
      \ one who delivers, shut the womb?\n    says your God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her,\n    all you who love her;\n\
      rejoice with her in joy,\n    all you who mourn over her—\n"
    11: "¹¹ that you may nurse and be satisfied\n    from her consoling breast;\n\
      that you may drink deeply with delight\n    from her glorious bosom. \n"
    12: "¹² For thus says the Lord:\nI will extend prosperity to her like a river,\n\
      \    and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream;\nand you shall\
      \ nurse and be carried on her arm,\n    and dandled on her knees.\n"
    13: "¹³ As a mother comforts her child,\n    so I will comfort you;\n    you shall\
      \ be comforted in Jerusalem. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice;\n    your bodies shall flourish\
      \ like the grass;\nand it shall be known that the hand of the Lord is with his\
      \ servants,\n    and his indignation is against his enemies.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For the Lord will come in fire,\n    and his chariots like the whirlwind,\n\
      to pay back his anger in fury,\n    and his rebuke in flames of fire.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For by fire will the Lord execute judgment,\n    and by his sword, on\
      \ all flesh;\n    and those slain by the Lord shall be many. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following\
      \ the one in the center, eating the flesh of pigs, vermin, and rodents, shall\
      \ come to an end together, says the Lord. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ For I know their works and their thoughts, and I am coming to gather all
      nations and tongues; and they shall come and shall see my glory, '
    19: '¹⁹ and I will set a sign among them. From them I will send survivors to the
      nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud—which draw the bow—to Tubal and Javan, to
      the coastlands far away that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory; and
      they shall declare my glory among the nations. '
    20: '²⁰ They shall bring all your kindred from all the nations as an offering
      to the Lord, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on
      dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, just as the Israelites
      bring a grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord. '
    21: "²¹ And I will also take some of them as priests and as Levites, says the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    22: "²² For as the new heavens and the new earth,\n    which I will make,\nshall\
      \ remain before me, says the Lord;\n    so shall your descendants and your name\
      \ remain.\n"
    23: "²³ From new moon to new moon,\n    and from sabbath to sabbath,\nall flesh\
      \ shall come to worship before me,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    24: ²⁴ And they shall go out and look at the dead bodies of the people who have
      rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched,
      and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
