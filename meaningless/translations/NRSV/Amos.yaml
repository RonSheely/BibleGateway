Amos:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning\
      \ Israel in the days of King Uzziah of Judah and in the days of King Jeroboam\
      \ son of Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake. \n"
    2: "² And he said:\nThe Lord roars from Zion,\n    and utters his voice from Jerusalem;\n\
      the pastures of the shepherds wither,\n    and the top of Carmel dries up. \n"
    3: "³ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Damascus,\n    and for\
      \ four, I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause they have threshed Gilead\n\
      \    with threshing sledges of iron.\n"
    4: "⁴ So I will send a fire on the house of Hazael,\n    and it shall devour the\
      \ strongholds of Ben-hadad.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will break the gate bars of Damascus,\n    and cut off the inhabitants\
      \ from the Valley of Aven,\nand the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden;\n\
      \    and the people of Aram shall go into exile to Kir,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Gaza,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause they carried into exile entire\
      \ communities,\n    to hand them over to Edom.\n"
    7: "⁷ So I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza,\n    fire that shall devour its\
      \ strongholds.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod,\n    and the one who holds the\
      \ scepter from Ashkelon;\nI will turn my hand against Ekron,\n    and the remnant\
      \ of the Philistines shall perish,\nsays the Lord God. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Tyre,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause they delivered entire communities\
      \ over to Edom,\n    and did not remember the covenant of kinship.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ So I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre,\n    fire that shall devour\
      \ its strongholds. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Edom,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause he pursued his brother with the\
      \ sword\n    and cast off all pity;\nhe maintained his anger perpetually,\n\
      \    and kept his wrath forever.\n"
    12: "¹² So I will send a fire on Teman,\n    and it shall devour the strongholds\
      \ of Bozrah. \n"
    13: "¹³ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of the Ammonites,\n    and\
      \ for four, I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause they have ripped open\
      \ pregnant women in Gilead\n    in order to enlarge their territory.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ So I will kindle a fire against the wall of Rabbah,\n    fire that shall\
      \ devour its strongholds,\nwith shouting on the day of battle,\n    with a storm\
      \ on the day of the whirlwind;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ then their king shall go into exile,\n    he and his officials together,\n\
      says the Lord."
  2:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Moab,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause he burned to lime\n    the bones\
      \ of the king of Edom.\n"
    2: "² So I will send a fire on Moab,\n    and it shall devour the strongholds\
      \ of Kerioth,\nand Moab shall die amid uproar,\n    amid shouting and the sound\
      \ of the trumpet;\n"
    3: "³ I will cut off the ruler from its midst,\n    and will kill all its officials\
      \ with him,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Judah,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause they have rejected the law of the\
      \ Lord,\n    and have not kept his statutes,\nbut they have been led astray\
      \ by the same lies\n    after which their ancestors walked.\n"
    5: "⁵ So I will send a fire on Judah,\n    and it shall devour the strongholds\
      \ of Jerusalem. \n"
    6: "⁶ Thus says the Lord:\nFor three transgressions of Israel,\n    and for four,\
      \ I will not revoke the punishment;\nbecause they sell the righteous for silver,\n\
      \    and the needy for a pair of sandals—\n"
    7: "⁷ they who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth,\n    and\
      \ push the afflicted out of the way;\nfather and son go in to the same girl,\n\
      \    so that my holy name is profaned;\n"
    8: "⁸ they lay themselves down beside every altar\n    on garments taken in pledge;\n\
      and in the house of their God they drink\n    wine bought with fines they imposed.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,\n    whose height was like the\
      \ height of cedars,\n    and who was as strong as oaks;\nI destroyed his fruit\
      \ above,\n    and his roots beneath.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,\n    and led you forty\
      \ years in the wilderness,\n    to possess the land of the Amorite.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And I raised up some of your children to be prophets\n    and some of\
      \ your youths to be nazirites.\n    Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?\n\
      says the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² But you made the nazirites drink wine,\n    and commanded the prophets,\n\
      \    saying, “You shall not prophesy.” \n"
    13: "¹³ So, I will press you down in your place,\n    just as a cart presses down\n\
      \    when it is full of sheaves.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Flight shall perish from the swift,\n    and the strong shall not retain\
      \ their strength,\n    nor shall the mighty save their lives;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ those who handle the bow shall not stand,\n    and those who are swift\
      \ of foot shall not save themselves,\n    nor shall those who ride horses save\
      \ their lives;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ and those who are stout of heart among the mighty\n    shall flee away\
      \ naked in that day,\nsays the Lord."
  3:
    1: "¹ Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O people of Israel,\
      \ against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt: \n"
    2: "² You only have I known\n    of all the families of the earth;\ntherefore\
      \ I will punish you\n    for all your iniquities. \n"
    3: "³ Do two walk together\n    unless they have made an appointment?\n"
    4: "⁴ Does a lion roar in the forest,\n    when it has no prey?\nDoes a young\
      \ lion cry out from its den,\n    if it has caught nothing?\n"
    5: "⁵ Does a bird fall into a snare on the earth,\n    when there is no trap for\
      \ it?\nDoes a snare spring up from the ground,\n    when it has taken nothing?\n"
    6: "⁶ Is a trumpet blown in a city,\n    and the people are not afraid?\nDoes\
      \ disaster befall a city,\n    unless the Lord has done it?\n"
    7: "⁷ Surely the Lord God does nothing,\n    without revealing his secret\n  \
      \  to his servants the prophets.\n"
    8: "⁸ The lion has roared;\n    who will not fear?\nThe Lord God has spoken;\n\
      \    who can but prophesy? \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim to the strongholds in Ashdod,\n    and to the strongholds in the\
      \ land of Egypt,\nand say, “Assemble yourselves on Mount Samaria,\n    and see\
      \ what great tumults are within it,\n    and what oppressions are in its midst.”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They do not know how to do right, says the Lord,\n    those who store\
      \ up violence and robbery in their strongholds.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore thus says the Lord God:\nAn adversary shall surround the land,\n\
      \    and strip you of your defense;\n    and your strongholds shall be plundered.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Thus says the Lord: As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion\
      \ two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the people of Israel who live in\
      \ Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part of a bed. \n"
    13: "¹³ Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob,\n    says the Lord God,\
      \ the God of hosts:\n"
    14: "¹⁴ On the day I punish Israel for its transgressions,\n    I will punish\
      \ the altars of Bethel,\nand the horns of the altar shall be cut off\n    and\
      \ fall to the ground.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will tear down the winter house as well as the summer house;\n    and\
      \ the houses of ivory shall perish,\nand the great houses shall come to an end,\n\
      says the Lord."
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear this word, you cows of Bashan\n    who are on Mount Samaria,\nwho oppress\
      \ the poor, who crush the needy,\n    who say to their husbands, “Bring something\
      \ to drink!”\n"
    2: "² The Lord God has sworn by his holiness:\n    The time is surely coming upon\
      \ you,\nwhen they shall take you away with hooks,\n    even the last of you\
      \ with fishhooks.\n"
    3: "³ Through breaches in the wall you shall leave,\n    each one straight ahead;\n\
      \    and you shall be flung out into Harmon,\nsays the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ Come to Bethel—and transgress;\n    to Gilgal—and multiply transgression;\n\
      bring your sacrifices every morning,\n    your tithes every three days;\n"
    5: "⁵ bring a thank offering of leavened bread,\n    and proclaim freewill offerings,\
      \ publish them;\n    for so you love to do, O people of Israel!\nsays the Lord\
      \ God. \n"
    6: "⁶ I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\n    and lack of bread\
      \ in all your places,\nyet you did not return to me,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    7: "⁷ And I also withheld the rain from you\n    when there were still three months\
      \ to the harvest;\nI would send rain on one city,\n    and send no rain on another\
      \ city;\none field would be rained upon,\n    and the field on which it did\
      \ not rain withered;\n"
    8: "⁸ so two or three towns wandered to one town\n    to drink water, and were\
      \ not satisfied;\nyet you did not return to me,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ I struck you with blight and mildew;\n    I laid waste your gardens and\
      \ your vineyards;\n    the locust devoured your fig trees and your olive trees;\n\
      yet you did not return to me,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I sent among you a pestilence after the manner of Egypt;\n    I killed\
      \ your young men with the sword;\nI carried away your horses;\n    and I made\
      \ the stench of your camp go up into your nostrils;\nyet you did not return\
      \ to me,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ I overthrew some of you,\n    as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,\n\
      \    and you were like a brand snatched from the fire;\nyet you did not return\
      \ to me,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel;\n    because I will do this\
      \ to you,\n    prepare to meet your God, O Israel! \n"
    13: "¹³ For lo, the one who forms the mountains, creates the wind,\n    reveals\
      \ his thoughts to mortals,\nmakes the morning darkness,\n    and treads on the\
      \ heights of the earth—\n    the Lord, the God of hosts, is his name!"
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this word that I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Fallen, no more to rise,\n    is maiden Israel;\nforsaken on her land,\n\
      \    with no one to raise her up. \n"
    3: "³ For thus says the Lord God:\nThe city that marched out a thousand\n    shall\
      \ have a hundred left,\nand that which marched out a hundred\n    shall have\
      \ ten left. \n"
    4: "⁴ For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel:\nSeek me and live;\n"
    5: "⁵     but do not seek Bethel,\nand do not enter into Gilgal\n    or cross\
      \ over to Beer-sheba;\nfor Gilgal shall surely go into exile,\n    and Bethel\
      \ shall come to nothing. \n"
    6: "⁶ Seek the Lord and live,\n    or he will break out against the house of Joseph\
      \ like fire,\n    and it will devour Bethel, with no one to quench it.\n"
    7: "⁷ Ah, you that turn justice to wormwood,\n    and bring righteousness to the\
      \ ground! \n"
    8: "⁸ The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,\n    and turns deep darkness into\
      \ the morning,\n    and darkens the day into night,\nwho calls for the waters\
      \ of the sea,\n    and pours them out on the surface of the earth,\nthe Lord\
      \ is his name,\n"
    9: "⁹ who makes destruction flash out against the strong,\n    so that destruction\
      \ comes upon the fortress. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They hate the one who reproves in the gate,\n    and they abhor the one\
      \ who speaks the truth.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore because you trample on the poor\n    and take from them levies\
      \ of grain,\nyou have built houses of hewn stone,\n    but you shall not live\
      \ in them;\nyou have planted pleasant vineyards,\n    but you shall not drink\
      \ their wine.\n"
    12: "¹² For I know how many are your transgressions,\n    and how great are your\
      \ sins—\nyou who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,\n    and push aside\
      \ the needy in the gate.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore the prudent will keep silent in such a time;\n    for it is\
      \ an evil time. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Seek good and not evil,\n    that you may live;\nand so the Lord, the\
      \ God of hosts, will be with you,\n    just as you have said.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hate evil and love good,\n    and establish justice in the gate;\nit may\
      \ be that the Lord, the God of hosts,\n    will be gracious to the remnant of\
      \ Joseph. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord:\nIn all the\
      \ squares there shall be wailing;\n    and in all the streets they shall say,\
      \ “Alas! alas!”\nThey shall call the farmers to mourning,\n    and those skilled\
      \ in lamentation, to wailing;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ in all the vineyards there shall be wailing,\n    for I will pass through\
      \ the midst of you,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Alas for you who desire the day of the Lord!\n    Why do you want the\
      \ day of the Lord?\nIt is darkness, not light;\n"
    19: "¹⁹     as if someone fled from a lion,\n    and was met by a bear;\nor went\
      \ into the house and rested a hand against the wall,\n    and was bitten by\
      \ a snake.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is not the day of the Lord darkness, not light,\n    and gloom with no\
      \ brightness in it? \n"
    21: "²¹ I hate, I despise your festivals,\n    and I take no delight in your solemn\
      \ assemblies.\n"
    22: "²² Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,\n \
      \   I will not accept them;\nand the offerings of well-being of your fatted\
      \ animals\n    I will not look upon.\n"
    23: "²³ Take away from me the noise of your songs;\n    I will not listen to the\
      \ melody of your harps.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But let justice roll down like waters,\n    and righteousness like an\
      \ ever-flowing stream. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings the forty years in the wilderness,
      O house of Israel? '
    26: '²⁶ You shall take up Sakkuth your king, and Kaiwan your star-god, your images,
      which you made for yourselves; '
    27: ²⁷ therefore I will take you into exile beyond Damascus, says the Lord, whose
      name is the God of hosts.
  6:
    1: "¹ Alas for those who are at ease in Zion,\n    and for those who feel secure\
      \ on Mount Samaria,\nthe notables of the first of the nations,\n    to whom\
      \ the house of Israel resorts!\n"
    2: "² Cross over to Calneh, and see;\n    from there go to Hamath the great;\n\
      \    then go down to Gath of the Philistines.\nAre you better than these kingdoms?\n\
      \    Or is your territory greater than their territory,\n"
    3: "³ O you that put far away the evil day,\n    and bring near a reign of violence?\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Alas for those who lie on beds of ivory,\n    and lounge on their couches,\n\
      and eat lambs from the flock,\n    and calves from the stall;\n"
    5: "⁵ who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp,\n    and like David improvise\
      \ on instruments of music;\n"
    6: "⁶ who drink wine from bowls,\n    and anoint themselves with the finest oils,\n\
      \    but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!\n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore they shall now be the first to go into exile,\n    and the revelry\
      \ of the loungers shall pass away. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord God has sworn by himself\n(says the Lord, the God of hosts):\n\
      I abhor the pride of Jacob\n    and hate his strongholds;\n    and I will deliver\
      \ up the city and all that is in it. \n"
    9: '⁹ If ten people remain in one house, they shall die. '
    10: "¹⁰ And if a relative, one who burns the dead, shall take up the body to bring\
      \ it out of the house, and shall say to someone in the innermost parts of the\
      \ house, “Is anyone else with you?” the answer will come, “No.” Then the relative\
      \ shall say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ See, the Lord commands,\n    and the great house shall be shattered to\
      \ bits,\n    and the little house to pieces.\n"
    12: "¹² Do horses run on rocks?\n    Does one plow the sea with oxen?\nBut you\
      \ have turned justice into poison\n    and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—\n"
    13: "¹³ you who rejoice in Lo-debar,\n    who say, “Have we not by our own strength\n\
      \    taken Karnaim for ourselves?”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Indeed, I am raising up against you a nation,\n    O house of Israel,\
      \ says the Lord, the God of hosts,\nand they shall oppress you from Lebo-hamath\n\
      \    to the Wadi Arabah."
  7:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord God showed me: he was forming locusts at the time
      the latter growth began to sprout (it was the latter growth after the king’s
      mowings). '
    2: "² When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said,\n“O Lord God,\
      \ forgive, I beg you!\n    How can Jacob stand?\n    He is so small!”\n"
    3: "³ The Lord relented concerning this;\n    “It shall not be,” said the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ This is what the Lord God showed me: the Lord God was calling for a shower
      of fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land. '
    5: "⁵ Then I said,\n“O Lord God, cease, I beg you!\n    How can Jacob stand?\n\
      \    He is so small!”\n"
    6: "⁶ The Lord relented concerning this;\n    “This also shall not be,” said the\
      \ Lord God. \n"
    7: '⁷ This is what he showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with
      a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. '
    8: "⁸ And the Lord said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.”\
      \ Then the Lord said,\n“See, I am setting a plumb line\n    in the midst of\

    9: "⁹ the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate,\n    and the sanctuaries\
      \ of Israel shall be laid waste,\n    and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam\
      \ with the sword.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying,
      “Amos has conspired against you in the very center of the house of Israel; the
      land is not able to bear all his words. '
    11: "¹¹ For thus Amos has said,\n‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,\n    and Israel\
      \ must go into exile\n    away from his land.’” \n"
    12: '¹² And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah,

    13: "¹³ but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and\
      \ it is a temple of the kingdom.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I am no prophet, nor a prophet’s son; but
      I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, '
    15: "¹⁵ and the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me,\

  8:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord God showed me—a basket of summer fruit. '

      \ lives in it,\nand all of it rise like the Nile,\n    and be tossed about and\
      \ sink again, like the Nile of Egypt? \n"
    9: "⁹ On that day, says the Lord God,\n    I will make the sun go down at noon,\n\
      \    and darken the earth in broad daylight.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will turn your feasts into mourning,\n    and all your songs into lamentation;\n\
      I will bring sackcloth on all loins,\n    and baldness on every head;\nI will\
      \ make it like the mourning for an only son,\n    and the end of it like a bitter\
      \ day. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The time is surely coming, says the Lord God,\n    when I will send a\
      \ famine on the land;\nnot a famine of bread, or a thirst for water,\n    but\
      \ of hearing the words of the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² They shall wander from sea to sea,\n    and from north to east;\nthey\
      \ shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord,\n    but they shall not\
      \ find it. \n"
    13: "¹³ In that day the beautiful young women and the young men\n    shall faint\
      \ for thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Those who swear by Ashimah of Samaria,\n    and say, “As your god lives,\
      \ O Dan,”\nand, “As the way of Beer-sheba lives”—\n    they shall fall, and\
      \ never rise again."
  9:
    1: "¹ I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said:\nStrike the capitals\
      \ until the thresholds shake,\n    and shatter them on the heads of all the\
      \ people;\nand those who are left I will kill with the sword;\n    not one of\
      \ them shall flee away,\n    not one of them shall escape. \n"
    2: "² Though they dig into Sheol,\n    from there shall my hand take them;\nthough\
      \ they climb up to heaven,\n    from there I will bring them down.\n"
    3: "³ Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,\n    from there I will\
      \ search out and take them;\nand though they hide from my sight at the bottom\
      \ of the sea,\n    there I will command the sea-serpent, and it shall bite them.\n"
    4: "⁴ And though they go into captivity in front of their enemies,\n    there\
      \ I will command the sword, and it shall kill them;\nand I will fix my eyes\
      \ on them\n    for harm and not for good. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord, God of hosts,\nhe who touches the earth and it melts,\n    and\
      \ all who live in it mourn,\nand all of it rises like the Nile,\n    and sinks\
      \ again, like the Nile of Egypt;\n"
    6: "⁶ who builds his upper chambers in the heavens,\n    and founds his vault\
      \ upon the earth;\nwho calls for the waters of the sea,\n    and pours them\
      \ out upon the surface of the earth—\nthe Lord is his name. \n"
    7: "⁷ Are you not like the Ethiopians to me,\n    O people of Israel? says the\
      \ Lord.\nDid I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt,\n    and the Philistines\
      \ from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?\n"
    8: "⁸ The eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom,\n    and I will destroy\
      \ it from the face of the earth\n    —except that I will not utterly destroy\
      \ the house of Jacob,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ For lo, I will command,\n    and shake the house of Israel among all the\
      \ nations\nas one shakes with a sieve,\n    but no pebble shall fall to the\
      \ ground.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword,\n    who say, “Evil\
      \ shall not overtake or meet us.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ On that day I will raise up\n    the booth of David that is fallen,\n\
      and repair its breaches,\n    and raise up its ruins,\n    and rebuild it as\
      \ in the days of old;\n"
    12: "¹² in order that they may possess the remnant of Edom\n    and all the nations\
      \ who are called by my name,\n    says the Lord who does this. \n"
    13: "¹³ The time is surely coming, says the Lord,\n    when the one who plows\
      \ shall overtake the one who reaps,\n    and the treader of grapes the one who\
      \ sows the seed;\nthe mountains shall drip sweet wine,\n    and all the hills\
      \ shall flow with it.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel,\n    and they shall rebuild\
      \ the ruined cities and inhabit them;\nthey shall plant vineyards and drink\
      \ their wine,\n    and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will plant them upon their land,\n    and they shall never again be\
      \ plucked up\n    out of the land that I have given them,\nsays the Lord your\
      \ God."
