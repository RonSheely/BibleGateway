Obadiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Obadiah.\nThus says the Lord God concerning Edom:\nWe have\
      \ heard a report from the Lord,\n    and a messenger has been sent among the\
      \ nations:\n“Rise up! Let us rise against it for battle!”\n"
    2: "² I will surely make you least among the nations;\n    you shall be utterly\
      \ despised.\n"
    3: "³ Your proud heart has deceived you,\n    you that live in the clefts of the\
      \ rock,\n    whose dwelling is in the heights.\nYou say in your heart,\n   \
      \ “Who will bring me down to the ground?”\n"
    4: "⁴ Though you soar aloft like the eagle,\n    though your nest is set among\
      \ the stars,\n    from there I will bring you down,\nsays the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ If thieves came to you,\n    if plunderers by night\n    —how you have been\
      \ destroyed!—\n    would they not steal only what they wanted?\nIf grape-gatherers\
      \ came to you,\n    would they not leave gleanings?\n"
    6: "⁶ How Esau has been pillaged,\n    his treasures searched out!\n"
    7: "⁷ All your allies have deceived you,\n    they have driven you to the border;\n\
      your confederates have prevailed against you;\n    those who ate your bread\
      \ have set a trap for you—\n    there is no understanding of it.\n"
    8: "⁸ On that day, says the Lord,\n    I will destroy the wise out of Edom,\n\
      \    and understanding out of Mount Esau.\n"
    9: "⁹ Your warriors shall be shattered, O Teman,\n    so that everyone from Mount\
      \ Esau will be cut off. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the slaughter and violence done to your brother Jacob,\n    shame\
      \ shall cover you,\n    and you shall be cut off forever.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On the day that you stood aside,\n    on the day that strangers carried\
      \ off his wealth,\nand foreigners entered his gates\n    and cast lots for Jerusalem,\n\
      \    you too were like one of them.\n"
    12: "¹² But you should not have gloated over your brother\n    on the day of his\
      \ misfortune;\nyou should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah\n    on\
      \ the day of their ruin;\nyou should not have boasted\n    on the day of distress.\n"
    13: "¹³ You should not have entered the gate of my people\n    on the day of their\
      \ calamity;\nyou should not have joined in the gloating over Judah’s disaster\n\
      \    on the day of his calamity;\nyou should not have looted his goods\n   \
      \ on the day of his calamity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You should not have stood at the crossings\n    to cut off his fugitives;\n\
      you should not have handed over his survivors\n    on the day of distress. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For the day of the Lord is near against all the nations.\nAs you have\
      \ done, it shall be done to you;\n    your deeds shall return on your own head.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For as you have drunk on my holy mountain,\n    all the nations around\
      \ you shall drink;\nthey shall drink and gulp down,\n    and shall be as though\
      \ they had never been. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But on Mount Zion there shall be those that escape,\n    and it shall\
      \ be holy;\nand the house of Jacob shall take possession of those who dispossessed\
      \ them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The house of Jacob shall be a fire,\n    the house of Joseph a flame,\n\
      \    and the house of Esau stubble;\nthey shall burn them and consume them,\n\
      \    and there shall be no survivor of the house of Esau;\nfor the Lord has\
      \ spoken.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau,\n    and those of the Shephelah\
      \ the land of the Philistines;\nthey shall possess the land of Ephraim and the\
      \ land of Samaria,\n    and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The exiles of the Israelites who are in Halah\n    shall possess Phoenicia\
      \ as far as Zarephath;\nand the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad\n  \
      \  shall possess the towns of the Negeb.\n"
    21: "²¹ Those who have been saved shall go up to Mount Zion\n    to rule Mount\
      \ Esau;\n    and the kingdom shall be the Lord’s."
