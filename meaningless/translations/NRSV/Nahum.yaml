    3: "³ The Lord is slow to anger but great in power,\n    and the Lord will by\
      \ no means clear the guilty.\nHis way is in whirlwind and storm,\n    and the\
      \ clouds are the dust of his feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ He rebukes the sea and makes it dry,\n    and he dries up all the rivers;\n\

      \ before him,\n    the world and all who live in it. \n"

      \ they will be cut off and pass away.\nThough I have afflicted you,\n    I will\
      \ afflict you no more.\n"
    13: "¹³ And now I will break off his yoke from you\n    and snap the bonds that\
      \ bind you.” \n"

      \ no longer;\nfrom the house of your gods I will cut off\n    the carved image\
      \ and the cast image.\nI will make your grave, for you are worthless.” \n"

      \    who proclaims peace!\nCelebrate your festivals, O Judah,\n    fulfill your\
      \ vows,\nfor never again shall the wicked invade you;\n    they are utterly\
      \ cut off."

      \ \n"

      \ tremble,\nall loins quake,\n    all faces grow pale!\n"
    11: "¹¹ What became of the lions’ den,\n    the cave of the young lions,\nwhere\
      \ the lion goes,\n    and the lion’s cubs, with no one to disturb them?\n"
    12: "¹² The lion has torn enough for his whelps\n    and strangled prey for his\
      \ lionesses;\nhe has filled his caves with prey\n    and his dens with torn\
      \ flesh. \n"
    13: ¹³ See, I am against you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will burn your chariots
      in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey
      from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall be heard no more.

      \ alluring, mistress of sorcery,\nwho enslaves nations through her debaucheries,\n\
      \    and peoples through her sorcery,\n"
    5: "⁵ I am against you,\n    says the Lord of hosts,\n    and will lift up your\
      \ skirts over your face;\nand I will let nations look on your nakedness\n  \
      \  and kingdoms on your shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will throw filth at you\n    and treat you with contempt,\n    and make\
      \ you a spectacle.\n"
    7: "⁷ Then all who see you will shrink from you and say,\n“Nineveh is devastated;\
      \ who will bemoan her?”\n    Where shall I seek comforters for you? \n"
    8: "⁸ Are you better than Thebes\n    that sat by the Nile,\nwith water around\
      \ her,\n    her rampart a sea,\n    water her wall?\n"
    9: "⁹ Ethiopia was her strength,\n    Egypt too, and that without limit;\n   \
      \ Put and the Libyans were her helpers. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet she became an exile,\n    she went into captivity;\neven her infants\
      \ were dashed in pieces\n    at the head of every street;\nlots were cast for\
      \ her nobles,\n    all her dignitaries were bound in fetters.\n"

      \ shaken they fall\n    into the mouth of the eater.\n"
    13: "¹³ Look at your troops:\n    they are women in your midst.\nThe gates of\
      \ your land\n    are wide open to your foes;\n    fire has devoured the bars\
      \ of your gates. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Draw water for the siege,\n    strengthen your forts;\ntrample the clay,\n\
      \    tread the mortar,\n    take hold of the brick mold!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ There the fire will devour you,\n    the sword will cut you off.\n   \
      \ It will devour you like the locust.\nMultiply yourselves like the locust,\n\
      \    multiply like the grasshopper!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You increased your merchants\n    more than the stars of the heavens.\n\
      \    The locust sheds its skin and flies away.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your guards are like grasshoppers,\n    your scribes like swarms of locusts\n\
      settling on the fences\n    on a cold day—\nwhen the sun rises, they fly away;\n\
      \    no one knows where they have gone. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your shepherds are asleep,\n    O king of Assyria;\n    your nobles slumber.\n\
      Your people are scattered on the mountains\n    with no one to gather them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ There is no assuaging your hurt,\n    your wound is mortal.\nAll who hear\
      \ the news about you\n    clap their hands over you.\nFor who has ever escaped\n\
      \    your endless cruelty?"
