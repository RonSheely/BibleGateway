Hosea:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Kings\
      \ Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in the days of King Jeroboam\
      \ son of Joash of Israel. \n"
    2: '² When the Lord first spoke through Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea, “Go, take
      for yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land
      commits great whoredom by forsaking the Lord.” '
    3: "³ So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore\
      \ him a son. \n"
    4: '⁴ And the Lord said to him, “Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will
      punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to
      the kingdom of the house of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.” \n"
    6: '⁶ She conceived again and bore a daughter. Then the Lord said to him, “Name
      her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive
      them. '
    7: "⁷ But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the\
      \ Lord their God; I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by war, or by\
      \ horses, or by horsemen.” \n"
    8: '⁸ When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. '
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord said, “Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am\
      \ not your God.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea,
      which can be neither measured nor numbered; and in the place where it was said
      to them, “You are not my people,” it shall be said to them, “Children of the
      living God.” '
    11: ¹¹ The people of Judah and the people of Israel shall be gathered together,
      and they shall appoint for themselves one head; and they shall take possession
      of the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
  2:
    1: "¹ Say to your brother, Ammi, and to your sister, Ruhamah. \n"
    2: "² Plead with your mother, plead—\n    for she is not my wife,\n    and I am\
      \ not her husband—\nthat she put away her whoring from her face,\n    and her\
      \ adultery from between her breasts,\n"
    3: "³ or I will strip her naked\n    and expose her as in the day she was born,\n\
      and make her like a wilderness,\n    and turn her into a parched land,\n   \
      \ and kill her with thirst.\n"
    4: "⁴ Upon her children also I will have no pity,\n    because they are children\
      \ of whoredom.\n"
    5: "⁵ For their mother has played the whore;\n    she who conceived them has acted\
      \ shamefully.\nFor she said, “I will go after my lovers;\n    they give me my\
      \ bread and my water,\n    my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.”\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns;\n    and I will build a wall\
      \ against her,\n    so that she cannot find her paths.\n"
    7: "⁷ She shall pursue her lovers,\n    but not overtake them;\nand she shall\
      \ seek them,\n    but shall not find them.\nThen she shall say, “I will go\n\
      \    and return to my first husband,\n    for it was better with me then than\
      \ now.”\n"
    8: "⁸ She did not know\n    that it was I who gave her\n    the grain, the wine,\
      \ and the oil,\nand who lavished upon her silver\n    and gold that they used\
      \ for Baal.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore I will take back\n    my grain in its time,\n    and my wine in\
      \ its season;\nand I will take away my wool and my flax,\n    which were to\
      \ cover her nakedness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now I will uncover her shame\n    in the sight of her lovers,\n    and\
      \ no one shall rescue her out of my hand.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will put an end to all her mirth,\n    her festivals, her new moons,\
      \ her sabbaths,\n    and all her appointed festivals.\n"
    12: "¹² I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,\n    of which she said,\n\
      “These are my pay,\n    which my lovers have given me.”\nI will make them a\
      \ forest,\n    and the wild animals shall devour them.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will punish her for the festival days of the Baals,\n    when she offered\
      \ incense to them\nand decked herself with her ring and jewelry,\n    and went\
      \ after her lovers,\n    and forgot me, says the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore, I will now allure her,\n    and bring her into the wilderness,\n\
      \    and speak tenderly to her.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ From there I will give her her vineyards,\n    and make the Valley of\
      \ Achor a door of hope.\nThere she shall respond as in the days of her youth,\n\
      \    as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ On that day, says the Lord, you will call me, “My husband,” and no longer
      will you call me, “My Baal.” '
    17: '¹⁷ For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall
      be mentioned by name no more. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will make for you a covenant on that day with the wild animals, the
      birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will abolish
      the bow, the sword, and war from the land; and I will make you lie down in safety. '
    19: '¹⁹ And I will take you for my wife forever; I will take you for my wife in
      righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. '
    20: "²⁰ I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you shall know the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ On that day I will answer, says the Lord,\n    I will answer the heavens\n\
      \    and they shall answer the earth;\n"
    22: "²² and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil,\n    and\
      \ they shall answer Jezreel;\n"
    23: "²³     and I will sow him for myself in the land.\nAnd I will have pity on\
      \ Lo-ruhamah,\n    and I will say to Lo-ammi, “You are my people”;\n    and\
      \ he shall say, “You are my God.”"
  3:
    1: '¹ The Lord said to me again, “Go, love a woman who has a lover and is an adulteress,
      just as the Lord loves the people of Israel, though they turn to other gods
      and love raisin cakes.” '
    2: '² So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barley and
      a measure of wine. '
    3: '³ And I said to her, “You must remain as mine for many days; you shall not
      play the whore, you shall not have intercourse with a man, nor I with you.” '
    4: '⁴ For the Israelites shall remain many days without king or prince, without
      sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or teraphim. '
    5: ⁵ Afterward the Israelites shall return and seek the Lord their God, and David
      their king; they shall come in awe to the Lord and to his goodness in the latter
      days.
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear the word of the Lord, O people of Israel;\n    for the Lord has an\
      \ indictment against the inhabitants of the land.\nThere is no faithfulness\
      \ or loyalty,\n    and no knowledge of God in the land.\n"
    2: "² Swearing, lying, and murder,\n    and stealing and adultery break out;\n\
      \    bloodshed follows bloodshed.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the land mourns,\n    and all who live in it languish;\ntogether\
      \ with the wild animals\n    and the birds of the air,\n    even the fish of\
      \ the sea are perishing. \n"
    4: "⁴ Yet let no one contend,\n    and let none accuse,\n    for with you is my\
      \ contention, O priest.\n"
    5: "⁵ You shall stumble by day;\n    the prophet also shall stumble with you by\
      \ night,\n    and I will destroy your mother.\n"
    6: "⁶ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;\n    because you have rejected\
      \ knowledge,\n    I reject you from being a priest to me.\nAnd since you have\
      \ forgotten the law of your God,\n    I also will forget your children. \n"
    7: "⁷ The more they increased,\n    the more they sinned against me;\n    they\
      \ changed their glory into shame.\n"
    8: "⁸ They feed on the sin of my people;\n    they are greedy for their iniquity.\n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall be like people, like priest;\n    I will punish them for their\
      \ ways,\n    and repay them for their deeds.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They shall eat, but not be satisfied;\n    they shall play the whore,\
      \ but not multiply;\nbecause they have forsaken the Lord\n    to devote themselves\
      \ to "
    11: "¹¹ whoredom.\nWine and new wine\n    take away the understanding.\n"
    12: "¹² My people consult a piece of wood,\n    and their divining rod gives them\
      \ oracles.\nFor a spirit of whoredom has led them astray,\n    and they have\
      \ played the whore, forsaking their God.\n"
    13: "¹³ They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,\n    and make offerings upon\
      \ the hills,\nunder oak, poplar, and terebinth,\n    because their shade is\
      \ good.\nTherefore your daughters play the whore,\n    and your daughters-in-law\
      \ commit adultery.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore,\n    nor your\
      \ daughters-in-law when they commit adultery;\nfor the men themselves go aside\
      \ with whores,\n    and sacrifice with temple prostitutes;\nthus a people without\
      \ understanding comes to ruin. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Though you play the whore, O Israel,\n    do not let Judah become guilty.\n\
      Do not enter into Gilgal,\n    or go up to Beth-aven,\n    and do not swear,\
      \ “As the Lord lives.”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Like a stubborn heifer,\n    Israel is stubborn;\ncan the Lord now feed\
      \ them\n    like a lamb in a broad pasture? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Ephraim is joined to idols—\n    let him alone.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ When their drinking is ended, they indulge in sexual orgies;\n    they\
      \ love lewdness more than their glory.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A wind has wrapped them in its wings,\n    and they shall be ashamed because\
      \ of their altars."
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this, O priests!\n    Give heed, O house of Israel!\nListen, O house\
      \ of the king!\n    For the judgment pertains to you;\nfor you have been a snare\
      \ at Mizpah,\n    and a net spread upon Tabor,\n"
    2: "² and a pit dug deep in Shittim;\n    but I will punish all of them. \n"
    3: "³ I know Ephraim,\n    and Israel is not hidden from me;\nfor now, O Ephraim,\
      \ you have played the whore;\n    Israel is defiled.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their deeds do not permit them\n    to return to their God.\nFor the spirit\
      \ of whoredom is within them,\n    and they do not know the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ Israel’s pride testifies against him;\n    Ephraim stumbles in his guilt;\n\
      \    Judah also stumbles with them.\n"
    6: "⁶ With their flocks and herds they shall go\n    to seek the Lord,\nbut they\
      \ will not find him;\n    he has withdrawn from them.\n"
    7: "⁷ They have dealt faithlessly with the Lord;\n    for they have borne illegitimate\
      \ children.\n    Now the new moon shall devour them along with their fields.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Blow the horn in Gibeah,\n    the trumpet in Ramah.\nSound the alarm at\
      \ Beth-aven;\n    look behind you, Benjamin!\n"
    9: "⁹ Ephraim shall become a desolation\n    in the day of punishment;\namong\
      \ the tribes of Israel\n    I declare what is sure.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The princes of Judah have become\n    like those who remove the landmark;\n\
      on them I will pour out\n    my wrath like water.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,\n    because he was determined\
      \ to go after vanity.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore I am like maggots to Ephraim,\n    and like rottenness to the\
      \ house of Judah.\n"
    13: "¹³ When Ephraim saw his sickness,\n    and Judah his wound,\nthen Ephraim\
      \ went to Assyria,\n    and sent to the great king.\nBut he is not able to cure\
      \ you\n    or heal your wound.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,\n    and like a young lion to the\
      \ house of Judah.\nI myself will tear and go away;\n    I will carry off, and\
      \ no one shall rescue.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will return again to my place\n    until they acknowledge their guilt\
      \ and seek my face.\n    In their distress they will beg my favor:"
  6:
    1: "¹ “Come, let us return to the Lord;\n    for it is he who has torn, and he\
      \ will heal us;\n    he has struck down, and he will bind us up.\n"
    2: "² After two days he will revive us;\n    on the third day he will raise us\
      \ up,\n    that we may live before him.\n"
    3: "³ Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord;\n    his appearing is as\
      \ sure as the dawn;\nhe will come to us like the showers,\n    like the spring\
      \ rains that water the earth.” \n"
    4: "⁴ What shall I do with you, O Ephraim?\n    What shall I do with you, O Judah?\n\
      Your love is like a morning cloud,\n    like the dew that goes away early.\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,\n    I have killed them by the\
      \ words of my mouth,\n    and my judgment goes forth as the light.\n"
    6: "⁶ For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,\n    the knowledge of God\
      \ rather than burnt offerings. \n"
    7: "⁷ But at Adam they transgressed the covenant;\n    there they dealt faithlessly\
      \ with me.\n"
    8: "⁸ Gilead is a city of evildoers,\n    tracked with blood.\n"
    9: "⁹ As robbers lie in wait for someone,\n    so the priests are banded together;\n\
      they murder on the road to Shechem,\n    they commit a monstrous crime.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;\n    Ephraim’s whoredom\
      \ is there, Israel is defiled. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.\nWhen I would restore the\
      \ fortunes of my people,"
  7:
    1: "¹ when I would heal Israel,\n    the corruption of Ephraim is revealed,\n\
      \    and the wicked deeds of Samaria;\nfor they deal falsely,\n    the thief\
      \ breaks in,\n    and the bandits raid outside.\n"
    2: "² But they do not consider\n    that I remember all their wickedness.\nNow\
      \ their deeds surround them,\n    they are before my face.\n"
    3: "³ By their wickedness they make the king glad,\n    and the officials by their\
      \ treachery.\n"
    4: "⁴ They are all adulterers;\n    they are like a heated oven,\nwhose baker\
      \ does not need to stir the fire,\n    from the kneading of the dough until\
      \ it is leavened.\n"
    5: "⁵ On the day of our king the officials\n    became sick with the heat of wine;\n\
      \    he stretched out his hand with mockers.\n"
    6: "⁶ For they are kindled like an oven, their heart burns within them;\n    all\
      \ night their anger smolders;\n    in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.\n"
    7: "⁷ All of them are hot as an oven,\n    and they devour their rulers.\nAll\
      \ their kings have fallen;\n    none of them calls upon me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples;\n    Ephraim is a cake not turned.\n"
    9: "⁹ Foreigners devour his strength,\n    but he does not know it;\ngray hairs\
      \ are sprinkled upon him,\n    but he does not know it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Israel’s pride testifies against him;\n    yet they do not return to the\
      \ Lord their God,\n    or seek him, for all this. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim has become like a dove,\n    silly and without sense;\n    they\
      \ call upon Egypt, they go to Assyria.\n"
    12: "¹² As they go, I will cast my net over them;\n    I will bring them down\
      \ like birds of the air;\n    I will discipline them according to the report\
      \ made to their assembly.\n"
    13: "¹³ Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!\n    Destruction to them,\
      \ for they have rebelled against me!\nI would redeem them,\n    but they speak\
      \ lies against me. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ They do not cry to me from the heart,\n    but they wail upon their beds;\n\
      they gash themselves for grain and wine;\n    they rebel against me.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ It was I who trained and strengthened their arms,\n    yet they plot evil\
      \ against me.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They turn to that which does not profit;\n    they have become like a\
      \ defective bow;\ntheir officials shall fall by the sword\n    because of the\
      \ rage of their tongue.\nSo much for their babbling in the land of Egypt."
  8:
    1: "¹ Set the trumpet to your lips!\n    One like a vulture is over the house\
      \ of the Lord,\nbecause they have broken my covenant,\n    and transgressed\
      \ my law.\n"
    2: "² Israel cries to me,\n    “My God, we—Israel—know you!”\n"
    3: "³ Israel has spurned the good;\n    the enemy shall pursue him. \n"
    4: "⁴ They made kings, but not through me;\n    they set up princes, but without\
      \ my knowledge.\nWith their silver and gold they made idols\n    for their own\
      \ destruction.\n"
    5: "⁵ Your calf is rejected, O Samaria.\n    My anger burns against them.\nHow\
      \ long will they be incapable of innocence?\n"
    6: "⁶     For it is from Israel,\nan artisan made it;\n    it is not God.\nThe\
      \ calf of Samaria\n    shall be broken to pieces. \n"
    7: "⁷ For they sow the wind,\n    and they shall reap the whirlwind.\nThe standing\
      \ grain has no heads,\n    it shall yield no meal;\nif it were to yield,\n \
      \   foreigners would devour it.\n"
    8: "⁸ Israel is swallowed up;\n    now they are among the nations\n    as a useless\
      \ vessel.\n"
    9: "⁹ For they have gone up to Assyria,\n    a wild ass wandering alone;\n   \
      \ Ephraim has bargained for lovers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Though they bargain with the nations,\n    I will now gather them up.\n\
      They shall soon writhe\n    under the burden of kings and princes. \n"
    11: "¹¹ When Ephraim multiplied altars to expiate sin,\n    they became to him\
      \ altars for sinning.\n"
    12: "¹² Though I write for him the multitude of my instructions,\n    they are\
      \ regarded as a strange thing.\n"
    13: "¹³ Though they offer choice sacrifices,\n    though they eat flesh,\n   \
      \ the Lord does not accept them.\nNow he will remember their iniquity,\n   \
      \ and punish their sins;\n    they shall return to Egypt.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Israel has forgotten his Maker,\n    and built palaces;\nand Judah has\
      \ multiplied fortified cities;\n    but I will send a fire upon his cities,\n\
      \    and it shall devour his strongholds."
  9:
    1: "¹ Do not rejoice, O Israel!\n    Do not exult as other nations do;\nfor you\
      \ have played the whore, departing from your God.\n    You have loved a prostitute’s\
      \ pay\n    on all threshing floors.\n"
    2: "² Threshing floor and wine vat shall not feed them,\n    and the new wine\
      \ shall fail them.\n"
    3: "³ They shall not remain in the land of the Lord;\n    but Ephraim shall return\
      \ to Egypt,\n    and in Assyria they shall eat unclean food. \n"
    4: "⁴ They shall not pour drink offerings of wine to the Lord,\n    and their\
      \ sacrifices shall not please him.\nSuch sacrifices shall be like mourners’\
      \ bread;\n    all who eat of it shall be defiled;\nfor their bread shall be\
      \ for their hunger only;\n    it shall not come to the house of the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ What will you do on the day of appointed festival,\n    and on the day of\
      \ the festival of the Lord?\n"
    6: "⁶ For even if they escape destruction,\n    Egypt shall gather them,\n   \
      \ Memphis shall bury them.\nNettles shall possess their precious things of silver;\n\
      \    thorns shall be in their tents. \n"
    7: "⁷ The days of punishment have come,\n    the days of recompense have come;\n\
      \    Israel cries,\n“The prophet is a fool,\n    the man of the spirit is mad!”\n\
      Because of your great iniquity,\n    your hostility is great.\n"
    8: "⁸ The prophet is a sentinel for my God over Ephraim,\nyet a fowler’s snare\
      \ is on all his ways,\n    and hostility in the house of his God.\n"
    9: "⁹ They have deeply corrupted themselves\n    as in the days of Gibeah;\nhe\
      \ will remember their iniquity,\n    he will punish their sins. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Like grapes in the wilderness,\n    I found Israel.\nLike the first fruit\
      \ on the fig tree,\n    in its first season,\n    I saw your ancestors.\nBut\
      \ they came to Baal-peor,\n    and consecrated themselves to a thing of shame,\n\
      \    and became detestable like the thing they loved.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim’s glory shall fly away like a bird—\n    no birth, no pregnancy,\
      \ no conception!\n"
    12: "¹² Even if they bring up children,\n    I will bereave them until no one\
      \ is left.\nWoe to them indeed\n    when I depart from them!\n"
    13: "¹³ Once I saw Ephraim as a young palm planted in a lovely meadow,\n    but\
      \ now Ephraim must lead out his children for slaughter.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Give them, O Lord—\n    what will you give?\nGive them a miscarrying womb\n\
      \    and dry breasts. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Every evil of theirs began at Gilgal;\n    there I came to hate them.\n\
      Because of the wickedness of their deeds\n    I will drive them out of my house.\n\
      I will love them no more;\n    all their officials are rebels. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Ephraim is stricken,\n    their root is dried up,\n    they shall bear\
      \ no fruit.\nEven though they give birth,\n    I will kill the cherished offspring\
      \ of their womb.\n"

      \ springs up like poisonous weeds\n    in the furrows of the field.\n"
    5: "⁵ The inhabitants of Samaria tremble\n    for the calf of Beth-aven.\nIts\
      \ people shall mourn for it,\n    and its idolatrous priests shall wail over\
      \ it,\n    over its glory that has departed from it.\n"
    6: "⁶ The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria\n    as tribute to the great\

    11: "¹¹ Ephraim was a trained heifer\n    that loved to thresh,\n    and I spared\
      \ her fair neck;\nbut I will make Ephraim break the ground;\n    Judah must\
      \ plow;\n    Jacob must harrow for himself.\n"
    12: "¹² Sow for yourselves righteousness;\n    reap steadfast love;\n    break\
      \ up your fallow ground;\nfor it is time to seek the Lord,\n    that he may\

    13: "¹³ You have plowed wickedness,\n    you have reaped injustice,\n    you have\
      \ eaten the fruit of lies.\nBecause you have trusted in your power\n    and\
      \ in the multitude of your warriors,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ therefore the tumult of war shall rise against your people,\n    and all\
      \ your fortresses shall be destroyed,\nas Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the\

      \ Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,\n    and the house of Israel with\
      \ deceit;\nbut Judah still walks with God,\n    and is faithful to the Holy\
      \ One."
  12:
    1: "¹ Ephraim herds the wind,\n    and pursues the east wind all day long;\nthey\
      \ multiply falsehood and violence;\n    they make a treaty with Assyria,\n \
      \   and oil is carried to Egypt. \n"

      he met him at Bethel,\n    and there he spoke with him.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord the God of hosts,\n    the Lord is his name!\n"
    6: "⁶ But as for you, return to your God,\n    hold fast to love and justice,\n\
      \    and wait continually for your God. \n"
    7: "⁷ A trader, in whose hands are false balances,\n    he loves to oppress.\n"
    8: "⁸ Ephraim has said, “Ah, I am rich,\n    I have gained wealth for myself;\n\
      in all of my gain\n    no offense has been found in me\n    that would be sin.”\n"

      \ through the prophets I will bring destruction.\n"
    11: "¹¹ In Gilead there is iniquity,\n    they shall surely come to nothing.\n\
      In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls,\n    so their altars shall be like stone heaps\n\

  13:
    1: "¹ When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling;\n    he was exalted in Israel;\n\
      \    but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.\n"
    2: "² And now they keep on sinning\n    and make a cast image for themselves,\n\
      idols of silver made according to their understanding,\n    all of them the\
      \ work of artisans.\n“Sacrifice to these,” they say.\n    People are kissing\
      \ calves!\n"
    3: "³ Therefore they shall be like the morning mist\n    or like the dew that\
      \ goes away early,\nlike chaff that swirls from the threshing floor\n    or\
      \ like smoke from a window. \n"
    4: "⁴ Yet I have been the Lord your God\n    ever since the land of Egypt;\nyou\
      \ know no God but me,\n    and besides me there is no savior.\n"
    5: "⁵ It was I who fed you in the wilderness,\n    in the land of drought.\n"
    6: "⁶ When I fed them, they were satisfied;\n    they were satisfied, and their\
