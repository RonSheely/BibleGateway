Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon\
      \ our dear friend and co-worker, "
    2: "² to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church\
      \ in your house: \n"
    3: "³ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: '⁴ When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God '
    5: '⁵ because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the
      Lord Jesus. '
    6: '⁶ I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive
      all the good that we may do for Christ. '
    7: "⁷ I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because\
      \ the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother. \n"
    8: '⁸ For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do
      your duty, '
    9: '⁹ yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love—and I, Paul, do this
      as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. '
    10: '¹⁰ I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become
      during my imprisonment. '
    11: '¹¹ Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you
      and to me. '
    12: '¹² I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. '
    13: '¹³ I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in
      your place during my imprisonment for the gospel; '
    14: '¹⁴ but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your
      good deed might be voluntary and not something forced. '
    15: '¹⁵ Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that
      you might have him back forever, '
    16: "¹⁶ no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially\
      \ to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. '
    18: '¹⁸ If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to
      my account. '
    19: '¹⁹ I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing
      about your owing me even your own self. '
    20: '²⁰ Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my
      heart in Christ. '
    21: "²¹ Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will\
      \ do even more than I say. \n"
    22: "²² One thing more—prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your\
      \ prayers to be restored to you. \n"
    23: '²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, '
    24: "²⁴ and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
