Job:
  1:
    1: '¹ There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was
      blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. '
    2: '² There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. '
    3: '³ He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of
      oxen, five hundred donkeys, and very many servants; so that this man was the
      greatest of all the people of the east. '
    4: '⁴ His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another’s houses in turn; and
      they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. '
    5: "⁵ And when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and sanctify\
      \ them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according\
      \ to the number of them all; for Job said, “It may be that my children have\
      \ sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.” This is what Job always did. \n"
    6: '⁶ One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the Lord,
      and Satan also came among them. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord,
      “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.” '
    8: '⁸ The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no
      one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns
      away from evil.” '
    9: '⁹ Then Satan answered the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing? '
    10: '¹⁰ Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has,
      on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have
      increased in the land. '
    11: '¹¹ But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will
      curse you to your face.” '
    12: "¹² The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, all that he has is in your power;\
      \ only do not stretch out your hand against him!” So Satan went out from the\
      \ presence of the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ One day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the
      eldest brother’s house, '
    14: '¹⁴ a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys
      were feeding beside them, '
    15: '¹⁵ and the Sabeans fell on them and carried them off, and killed the servants
      with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.” '
    16: '¹⁶ While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell
      from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; I alone
      have escaped to tell you.” '
    17: '¹⁷ While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed
      three columns, made a raid on the camels and carried them off, and killed the
      servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.” '
    18: '¹⁸ While he was still speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and daughters
      were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, '
    19: "¹⁹ and suddenly a great wind came across the desert, struck the four corners\
      \ of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; I alone\
      \ have escaped to tell you.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell on the ground
      and worshiped. '
    21: "²¹ He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return\
      \ there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of\
      \ the Lord.” \n"
    22: ²² In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.
  2:
    1: '¹ One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the Lord,
      and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord. '
    2: '² The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord,
      “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.” '
    3: '³ The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no
      one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns
      away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me
      against him, to destroy him for no reason.” '
    4: '⁴ Then Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! All that people have they
      will give to save their lives. '
    5: '⁵ But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will
      curse you to your face.” '
    6: "⁶ The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, he is in your power; only spare his\
      \ life.” \n"
    7: '⁷ So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and inflicted loathsome
      sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. '
    8: "⁸ Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Then his wife said to him, “Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse
      God, and die.” '
    10: "¹⁰ But he said to her, “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall\
      \ we receive the good at the hand of God, and not receive the bad?” In all this\
      \ Job did not sin with his lips. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now when Job’s three friends heard of all these troubles that had come
      upon him, each of them set out from his home—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the
      Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to go and console and
      comfort him. '
    12: '¹² When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him, and they
      raised their voices and wept aloud; they tore their robes and threw dust in
      the air upon their heads. '
    13: ¹³ They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one
      spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
  3:
    1: '¹ After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. '
    2: "² Job said: \n"
    3: "³ “Let the day perish in which I was born,\n    and the night that said,\n\
      \    ‘A man-child is conceived.’\n"
    4: "⁴ Let that day be darkness!\n    May God above not seek it,\n    or light\
      \ shine on it.\n"
    5: "⁵ Let gloom and deep darkness claim it.\n    Let clouds settle upon it;\n\
      \    let the blackness of the day terrify it.\n"
    6: "⁶ That night—let thick darkness seize it!\n    let it not rejoice among the\
      \ days of the year;\n    let it not come into the number of the months.\n"
    7: "⁷ Yes, let that night be barren;\n    let no joyful cry be heard in it.\n"
    8: "⁸ Let those curse it who curse the Sea,\n    those who are skilled to rouse\
      \ up Leviathan.\n"
    9: "⁹ Let the stars of its dawn be dark;\n    let it hope for light, but have\
      \ none;\n    may it not see the eyelids of the morning—\n"
    10: "¹⁰ because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,\n    and hide trouble\
      \ from my eyes. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Why did I not die at birth,\n    come forth from the womb and expire?\n"
    12: "¹² Why were there knees to receive me,\n    or breasts for me to suck?\n"
    13: "¹³ Now I would be lying down and quiet;\n    I would be asleep; then I would\
      \ be at rest\n"
    14: "¹⁴ with kings and counselors of the earth\n    who rebuild ruins for themselves,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ or with princes who have gold,\n    who fill their houses with silver.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Or why was I not buried like a stillborn child,\n    like an infant that\
      \ never sees the light?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There the wicked cease from troubling,\n    and there the weary are at\
      \ rest.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ There the prisoners are at ease together;\n    they do not hear the voice\
      \ of the taskmaster.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The small and the great are there,\n    and the slaves are free from their\
      \ masters. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Why is light given to one in misery,\n    and life to the bitter in soul,\n"
    21: "²¹ who long for death, but it does not come,\n    and dig for it more than\
      \ for hidden treasures;\n"
    22: "²² who rejoice exceedingly,\n    and are glad when they find the grave?\n"
    23: "²³ Why is light given to one who cannot see the way,\n    whom God has fenced\
      \ in?\n"
    24: "²⁴ For my sighing comes like my bread,\n    and my groanings are poured out\
      \ like water.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Truly the thing that I fear comes upon me,\n    and what I dread befalls\
      \ me.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;\n    I have no rest; but trouble comes.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered: \n"
    2: "² “If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended?\n    But who can\
      \ keep from speaking?\n"
    3: "³ See, you have instructed many;\n    you have strengthened the weak hands.\n"
    4: "⁴ Your words have supported those who were stumbling,\n    and you have made\
      \ firm the feeble knees.\n"
    5: "⁵ But now it has come to you, and you are impatient;\n    it touches you,\
      \ and you are dismayed.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is not your fear of God your confidence,\n    and the integrity of your\
      \ ways your hope? \n"
    7: "⁷ “Think now, who that was innocent ever perished?\n    Or where were the\
      \ upright cut off?\n"
    8: "⁸ As I have seen, those who plow iniquity\n    and sow trouble reap the same.\n"
    9: "⁹ By the breath of God they perish,\n    and by the blast of his anger they\
      \ are consumed.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion,\n    and the teeth\
      \ of the young lions are broken.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,\n    and the whelps of the\
      \ lioness are scattered. \n"
    12: "¹² “Now a word came stealing to me,\n    my ear received the whisper of it.\n"
    13: "¹³ Amid thoughts from visions of the night,\n    when deep sleep falls on\
      \ mortals,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ dread came upon me, and trembling,\n    which made all my bones shake.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ A spirit glided past my face;\n    the hair of my flesh bristled.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ It stood still,\n    but I could not discern its appearance.\nA form was\
      \ before my eyes;\n    there was silence, then I heard a voice:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘Can mortals be righteous before God?\n    Can human beings be pure before\
      \ their Maker?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Even in his servants he puts no trust,\n    and his angels he charges\
      \ with error;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ how much more those who live in houses of clay,\n    whose foundation\
      \ is in the dust,\n    who are crushed like a moth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Between morning and evening they are destroyed;\n    they perish forever\
      \ without any regarding it.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their tent-cord is plucked up within them,\n    and they die devoid of\
      \ wisdom.’"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Call now; is there anyone who will answer you?\nTo which of the holy ones\
      \ will you turn?\n"
    2: "² Surely vexation kills the fool,\n    and jealousy slays the simple.\n"
    3: "³ I have seen fools taking root,\n    but suddenly I cursed their dwelling.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their children are far from safety,\n    they are crushed in the gate,\n\
      \    and there is no one to deliver them.\n"
    5: "⁵ The hungry eat their harvest,\n    and they take it even out of the thorns;\n\
      \    and the thirsty pant after their wealth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For misery does not come from the earth,\n    nor does trouble sprout from\
      \ the ground;\n"
    7: "⁷ but human beings are born to trouble\n    just as sparks fly upward. \n"
    8: "⁸ “As for me, I would seek God,\n    and to God I would commit my cause.\n"
    9: "⁹ He does great things and unsearchable,\n    marvelous things without number.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He gives rain on the earth\n    and sends waters on the fields;\n"
    11: "¹¹ he sets on high those who are lowly,\n    and those who mourn are lifted\
      \ to safety.\n"
    12: "¹² He frustrates the devices of the crafty,\n    so that their hands achieve\
      \ no success.\n"
    13: "¹³ He takes the wise in their own craftiness;\n    and the schemes of the\
      \ wily are brought to a quick end.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They meet with darkness in the daytime,\n    and grope at noonday as in\
      \ the night.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth,\n    from the hand\
      \ of the mighty.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ So the poor have hope,\n    and injustice shuts its mouth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “How happy is the one whom God reproves;\n    therefore do not despise\
      \ the discipline of the Almighty.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For he wounds, but he binds up;\n    he strikes, but his hands heal.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will deliver you from six troubles;\n    in seven no harm shall touch\
      \ you.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In famine he will redeem you from death,\n    and in war from the power\
      \ of the sword.\n"
    21: "²¹ You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,\n    and shall not\
      \ fear destruction when it comes.\n"
    22: "²² At destruction and famine you shall laugh,\n    and shall not fear the\
      \ wild animals of the earth.\n"
    23: "²³ For you shall be in league with the stones of the field,\n    and the\
      \ wild animals shall be at peace with you.\n"
    24: "²⁴ You shall know that your tent is safe,\n    you shall inspect your fold\
      \ and miss nothing.\n"
    25: "²⁵ You shall know that your descendants will be many,\n    and your offspring\
      \ like the grass of the earth.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You shall come to your grave in ripe old age,\n    as a shock of grain\
      \ comes up to the threshing floor in its season.\n"
    27: "²⁷ See, we have searched this out; it is true.\n    Hear, and know it for\
      \ yourself.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Then Job answered: \n"
    2: "² “O that my vexation were weighed,\n    and all my calamity laid in the balances!\n"
    3: "³ For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea;\n    therefore my\
      \ words have been rash.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the arrows of the Almighty are in me;\n    my spirit drinks their poison;\n\
      \    the terrors of God are arrayed against me.\n"
    5: "⁵ Does the wild ass bray over its grass,\n    or the ox low over its fodder?\n"
    6: "⁶ Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt,\n    or is there any\
      \ flavor in the juice of mallows?\n"
    7: "⁷ My appetite refuses to touch them;\n    they are like food that is loathsome\
      \ to me. \n"
    8: "⁸ “O that I might have my request,\n    and that God would grant my desire;\n"
    9: "⁹ that it would please God to crush me,\n    that he would let loose his hand\
      \ and cut me off!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ This would be my consolation;\n    I would even exult in unrelenting pain;\n\
      \    for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.\n"
    11: "¹¹ What is my strength, that I should wait?\n    And what is my end, that\
      \ I should be patient?\n"
    12: "¹² Is my strength the strength of stones,\n    or is my flesh bronze?\n"
    13: "¹³ In truth I have no help in me,\n    and any resource is driven from me.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Those who withhold kindness from a friend\n    forsake the fear of the\
      \ Almighty.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed,\n    like freshets that\
      \ pass away,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ that run dark with ice,\n    turbid with melting snow.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ In time of heat they disappear;\n    when it is hot, they vanish from\
      \ their place.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The caravans turn aside from their course;\n    they go up into the waste,\
      \ and perish.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The caravans of Tema look,\n    the travelers of Sheba hope.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They are disappointed because they were confident;\n    they come there\
      \ and are confounded.\n"
    21: "²¹ Such you have now become to me;\n    you see my calamity, and are afraid.\n"
    22: "²² Have I said, ‘Make me a gift’?\n    Or, ‘From your wealth offer a bribe\
      \ for me’?\n"
    23: "²³ Or, ‘Save me from an opponent’s hand’?\n    Or, ‘Ransom me from the hand\
      \ of oppressors’? \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Teach me, and I will be silent;\n    make me understand how I have gone\
      \ wrong.\n"
    25: "²⁵ How forceful are honest words!\n    But your reproof, what does it reprove?\n"
    26: "²⁶ Do you think that you can reprove words,\n    as if the speech of the\
      \ desperate were wind?\n"
    27: "²⁷ You would even cast lots over the orphan,\n    and bargain over your friend.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “But now, be pleased to look at me;\n    for I will not lie to your face.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done.\n    Turn now, my vindication is at\
      \ stake.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Is there any wrong on my tongue?\n    Cannot my taste discern calamity?"
  7:
    1: "¹ “Do not human beings have a hard service on earth,\n    and are not their\
      \ days like the days of a laborer?\n"
    2: "² Like a slave who longs for the shadow,\n    and like laborers who look for\
      \ their wages,\n"
    3: "³ so I am allotted months of emptiness,\n    and nights of misery are apportioned\
      \ to me.\n"
    4: "⁴ When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I rise?’\n    But the night is long,\n\
      \    and I am full of tossing until dawn.\n"
    5: "⁵ My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt;\n    my skin hardens, then breaks\
      \ out again.\n"
    6: "⁶ My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,\n    and come to their end\
      \ without hope. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Remember that my life is a breath;\n    my eye will never again see good.\n"
    8: "⁸ The eye that beholds me will see me no more;\n    while your eyes are upon\
      \ me, I shall be gone.\n"
    9: "⁹ As the cloud fades and vanishes,\n    so those who go down to Sheol do not\
      \ come up;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ they return no more to their houses,\n    nor do their places know them\
      \ any more. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;\n    I will speak in the anguish\
      \ of my spirit;\n    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.\n"
    12: "¹² Am I the Sea, or the Dragon,\n    that you set a guard over me?\n"
    13: "¹³ When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,\n    my couch will ease my complaint,’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ then you scare me with dreams\n    and terrify me with visions,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ so that I would choose strangling\n    and death rather than this body.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I loathe my life; I would not live forever.\n    Let me alone, for my\
      \ days are a breath.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ What are human beings, that you make so much of them,\n    that you set\
      \ your mind on them,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ visit them every morning,\n    test them every moment?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Will you not look away from me for a while,\n    let me alone until I\
      \ swallow my spittle?\n"
    20: "²⁰ If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of humanity?\n    Why have\
      \ you made me your target?\n    Why have I become a burden to you?\n"
    21: "²¹ Why do you not pardon my transgression\n    and take away my iniquity?\n\
      For now I shall lie in the earth;\n    you will seek me, but I shall not be.”"
  8:
    1: "¹ Then Bildad the Shuhite answered: \n"
    2: "² “How long will you say these things,\n    and the words of your mouth be\
      \ a great wind?\n"
    3: "³ Does God pervert justice?\n    Or does the Almighty pervert the right?\n"
    4: "⁴ If your children sinned against him,\n    he delivered them into the power\
      \ of their transgression.\n"
    5: "⁵ If you will seek God\n    and make supplication to the Almighty,\n"
    6: "⁶ if you are pure and upright,\n    surely then he will rouse himself for\
      \ you\n    and restore to you your rightful place.\n"
    7: "⁷ Though your beginning was small,\n    your latter days will be very great.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “For inquire now of bygone generations,\n    and consider what their ancestors\
      \ have found;\n"
    9: "⁹ for we are but of yesterday, and we know nothing,\n    for our days on earth\
      \ are but a shadow.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Will they not teach you and tell you\n    and utter words out of their\
      \ understanding? \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh?\n    Can reeds flourish where\
      \ there is no water?\n"
    12: "¹² While yet in flower and not cut down,\n    they wither before any other\
      \ plant.\n"
    13: "¹³ Such are the paths of all who forget God;\n    the hope of the godless\
      \ shall perish.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Their confidence is gossamer,\n    a spider’s house their trust.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ If one leans against its house, it will not stand;\n    if one lays hold\
      \ of it, it will not endure.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The wicked thrive before the sun,\n    and their shoots spread over the\
      \ garden.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Their roots twine around the stoneheap;\n    they live among the rocks.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ If they are destroyed from their place,\n    then it will deny them, saying,\
      \ ‘I have never seen you.’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ See, these are their happy ways,\n    and out of the earth still others\
      \ will spring. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “See, God will not reject a blameless person,\n    nor take the hand of\
      \ evildoers.\n"

    33: "³³ if I have concealed my transgressions as others do,\n    by hiding my\
      \ iniquity in my bosom,\n"
    34: "³⁴ because I stood in great fear of the multitude,\n    and the contempt\

      The words of Job are ended."
  32:
    1: '¹ So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his
      own eyes. '
    2: '² Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry.
      He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God; '
    3: '³ he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer,
      though they had declared Job to be in the wrong. '
    4: '⁴ Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he. '
    5: "⁵ But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three\
      \ men, he became angry. \n"
    6: "⁶ Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered:\n“I am young in years,\n    and\
      \ you are aged;\ntherefore I was timid and afraid\n    to declare my opinion\
      \ to you.\n"
    7: "⁷ I said, ‘Let days speak,\n    and many years teach wisdom.’\n"
    8: "⁸ But truly it is the spirit in a mortal,\n    the breath of the Almighty,\
      \ that makes for understanding.\n"
    9: "⁹ It is not the old that are wise,\n    nor the aged that understand what\
      \ is right.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;\n    let me also declare my opinion.’\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “See, I waited for your words,\n    I listened for your wise sayings,\n\
      \    while you searched out what to say.\n"
    12: "¹² I gave you my attention,\n    but there was in fact no one that confuted\
      \ Job,\n    no one among you that answered his words.\n"
    13: "¹³ Yet do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;\n    God may vanquish him, not\
      \ a human.’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He has not directed his words against me,\n    and I will not answer him\
      \ with your speeches. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “They are dismayed, they answer no more;\n    they have not a word to\
      \ say.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And am I to wait, because they do not speak,\n    because they stand there,\
      \ and answer no more?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I also will give my answer;\n    I also will declare my opinion.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For I am full of words;\n    the spirit within me constrains me.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ My heart is indeed like wine that has no vent;\n    like new wineskins,\
      \ it is ready to burst.\n"
    20: "²⁰ I must speak, so that I may find relief;\n    I must open my lips and\

    21: "²¹ I will not show partiality to any person\n    or use flattery toward anyone.\n"
    22: "²² For I do not know how to flatter—\n    or my Maker would soon put an end\

  33:
    1: "¹ “But now, hear my speech, O Job,\n    and listen to all my words.\n"
    2: "² See, I open my mouth;\n    the tongue in my mouth speaks.\n"
    3: "³ My words declare the uprightness of my heart,\n    and what my lips know\

    12: "¹² “But in this you are not right. I will answer you:\n    God is greater\
      \ than any mortal.\n"
    13: "¹³ Why do you contend against him,\n    saying, ‘He will answer none of my\
      \ words’?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For God speaks in one way,\n    and in two, though people do not perceive\
      \ it.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ In a dream, in a vision of the night,\n    when deep sleep falls on mortals,\n\
      \    while they slumber on their beds,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ then he opens their ears,\n    and terrifies them with warnings,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ that he may turn them aside from their deeds,\n    and keep them from\
      \ pride,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ to spare their souls from the Pit,\n    their lives from traversing the\
      \ River.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They are also chastened with pain upon their beds,\n    and with continual\

    20: "²⁰ so that their lives loathe bread,\n    and their appetites dainty food.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen;\n    and their bones,\
      \ once invisible, now stick out.\n"
    22: "²² Their souls draw near the Pit,\n    and their lives to those who bring\
      \ death.\n"
    23: "²³ Then, if there should be for one of them an angel,\n    a mediator, one\
      \ of a thousand,\n    one who declares a person upright,\n"
    24: "²⁴ and he is gracious to that person, and says,\n    ‘Deliver him from going\
      \ down into the Pit;\n    I have found a ransom;\n"
    25: "²⁵ let his flesh become fresh with youth;\n    let him return to the days\
      \ of his youthful vigor’;\n"
    26: "²⁶ then he prays to God, and is accepted by him,\n    he comes into his presence\
      \ with joy,\nand God repays him for his righteousness.\n"
    27: "²⁷     That person sings to others and says,\n‘I sinned, and perverted what\
      \ was right,\n    and it was not paid back to me.\n"
    28: "²⁸ He has redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit,\n    and my life shall\
      \ see the light.’ \n"
    29: "²⁹ “God indeed does all these things,\n    twice, three times, with mortals,\n"
    30: "³⁰ to bring back their souls from the Pit,\n    so that they may see the\
      \ light of life.\n"
    31: "³¹ Pay heed, Job, listen to me;\n    be silent, and I will speak.\n"
    32: "³² If you have anything to say, answer me;\n    speak, for I desire to justify\
      \ you.\n"
    33: "³³ If not, listen to me;\n    be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
  34:
    1: "¹ Then Elihu continued and said: \n"
    2: "² “Hear my words, you wise men,\n    and give ear to me, you who know;\n"

    4: "⁴ Let us choose what is right;\n    let us determine among ourselves what\

    5: "⁵ For Job has said, ‘I am innocent,\n    and God has taken away my right;\n"
    6: "⁶ in spite of being right I am counted a liar;\n    my wound is incurable,\

    8: "⁸ who goes in company with evildoers\n    and walks with the wicked?\n"
    9: "⁹ For he has said, ‘It profits one nothing\n    to take delight in God.’ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Therefore, hear me, you who have sense,\n    far be it from God that\

    16: "¹⁶ “If you have understanding, hear this;\n    listen to what I say.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Shall one who hates justice govern?\n    Will you condemn one who is righteous\

    18: "¹⁸ who says to a king, ‘You scoundrel!’\n    and to princes, ‘You wicked\
      \ men!’;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ who shows no partiality to nobles,\n    nor regards the rich more than\

    22: "²² There is no gloom or deep darkness\n    where evildoers may hide themselves.\n"
    23: "²³ For he has not appointed a time for anyone\n    to go before God in judgment.\n"
    24: "²⁴ He shatters the mighty without investigation,\n    and sets others in\
      \ their place.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Thus, knowing their works,\n    he overturns them in the night, and they\
      \ are crushed.\n"
    26: "²⁶ He strikes them for their wickedness\n    while others look on,\n"
    27: "²⁷ because they turned aside from following him,\n    and had no regard for\
      \ any of his ways,\n"
    28: "²⁸ so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him,\n    and he heard\

    30: "³⁰ so that the godless should not reign,\n    or those who ensnare the people.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ “For has anyone said to God,\n    ‘I have endured punishment; I will not\

    33: "³³ Will he then pay back to suit you,\n    because you reject it?\nFor you\

    34: "³⁴ Those who have sense will say to me,\n    and the wise who hear me will\

    35: "³⁵ ‘Job speaks without knowledge,\n    his words are without insight.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ Would that Job were tried to the limit,\n    because his answers are those\

    37: "³⁷ For he adds rebellion to his sin;\n    he claps his hands among us,\n\

  35:
    1: "¹ Elihu continued and said: \n"

    6: "⁶ If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him?\n    And if your\

    12: "¹² There they cry out, but he does not answer,\n    because of the pride\

    13: "¹³ Surely God does not hear an empty cry,\n    nor does the Almighty regard\
      \ it.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ How much less when you say that you do not see him,\n    that the case\

  36:

    33: "³³ Its crashing tells about him;\n    he is jealous with anger against iniquity."
  37:
