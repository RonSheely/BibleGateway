Ruth:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a
      certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he and
      his wife and two sons. '
    2: '² The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the
      names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem
      in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. '
    3: '³ But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two
      sons. '
    4: '⁴ These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of
      the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years, '
    5: "⁵ both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so that the woman was left without her\
      \ two sons and her husband. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then she started to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of
      Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had considered
      his people and given them food. '
    7: '⁷ So she set out from the place where she had been living, she and her two
      daughters-in-law, and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah. '
    8: '⁸ But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back each of you to your
      mother’s house. May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the
      dead and with me. '
    9: '⁹ The Lord grant that you may find security, each of you in the house of your
      husband.” Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud. '
    10: '¹⁰ They said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.” '
    11: '¹¹ But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Do
      I still have sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? '
    12: '¹² Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband.
      Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I should have a husband tonight
      and bear sons, '
    13: '¹³ would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from
      marrying? No, my daughters, it has been far more bitter for me than for you,
      because the hand of the Lord has turned against me.” '
    14: "¹⁴ Then they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung\
      \ to her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and
      to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” '
    16: "¹⁶ But Ruth said,\n“Do not press me to leave you\n    or to turn back from\
      \ following you!\nWhere you go, I will go;\n    where you lodge, I will lodge;\n\
      your people shall be my people,\n    and your God my God.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Where you die, I will die—\n    there will I be buried.\nMay the Lord\
      \ do thus and so to me,\n    and more as well,\nif even death parts me from\
      \ you!” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more\
      \ to her. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they came
      to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and the women said,
      “Is this Naomi?” '
    20: "²⁰ She said to them,\n“Call me no longer Naomi,\n    call me Mara,\n    for\
      \ the Almighty has dealt bitterly with me.\n"
    21: "²¹ I went away full,\n    but the Lord has brought me back empty;\nwhy call\
      \ me Naomi\n    when the Lord has dealt harshly with me,\n    and the Almighty\
      \ has brought calamity upon me?” \n"
    22: ²² So Naomi returned together with Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law,
      who came back with her from the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem at the
      beginning of the barley harvest.
  2:
    1: '¹ Now Naomi had a kinsman on her husband’s side, a prominent rich man, of
      the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. '
    2: '² And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the field and glean among
      the ears of grain, behind someone in whose sight I may find favor.” She said
      to her, “Go, my daughter.” '
    3: '³ So she went. She came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers. As it
      happened, she came to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the
      family of Elimelech. '
    4: '⁴ Just then Boaz came from Bethlehem. He said to the reapers, “The Lord be
      with you.” They answered, “The Lord bless you.” '
    5: '⁵ Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “To whom
      does this young woman belong?” '
    6: '⁶ The servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, “She is the Moabite
      who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. '
    7: "⁷ She said, ‘Please, let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the\
      \ reapers.’ So she came, and she has been on her feet from early this morning\
      \ until now, without resting even for a moment.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Now listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in
      another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women. '
    9: '⁹ Keep your eyes on the field that is being reaped, and follow behind them.
      I have ordered the young men not to bother you. If you get thirsty, go to the
      vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then she fell prostrate, with her face to the ground, and said to him,
      “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take notice of me, when
      I am a foreigner?” '
    11: '¹¹ But Boaz answered her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law
      since the death of your husband has been fully told me, and how you left your
      father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not
      know before. '
    12: '¹² May the Lord reward you for your deeds, and may you have a full reward
      from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge!” '
    13: "¹³ Then she said, “May I continue to find favor in your sight, my lord, for\
      \ you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, even though I am\
      \ not one of your servants.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some of this bread,
      and dip your morsel in the sour wine.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he
      heaped up for her some parched grain. She ate until she was satisfied, and she
      had some left over. '
    15: '¹⁵ When she got up to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, “Let her glean
      even among the standing sheaves, and do not reproach her. '
    16: "¹⁶ You must also pull out some handfuls for her from the bundles, and leave\
      \ them for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she
      had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. '
    18: '¹⁸ She picked it up and came into the town, and her mother-in-law saw how
      much she had gleaned. Then she took out and gave her what was left over after
      she herself had been satisfied. '
    19: '¹⁹ Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? And where have
      you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law
      with whom she had worked, and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked
      today is Boaz.” '
    20: '²⁰ Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he by the Lord, whose
      kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!” Naomi also said to her, “The
      man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin.” '
    21: '²¹ Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay close by my servants,
      until they have finished all my harvest.’” '
    22: '²² Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, “It is better, my daughter, that
      you go out with his young women, otherwise you might be bothered in another
      field.” '
    23: ²³ So she stayed close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end
      of the barley and wheat harvests; and she lived with her mother-in-law.
  3:
    1: '¹ Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, I need to seek some security
      for you, so that it may be well with you. '
    2: '² Now here is our kinsman Boaz, with whose young women you have been working.
      See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. '
    3: '³ Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to
      the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has
      finished eating and drinking. '
    4: '⁴ When he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover
      his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.” '
    5: "⁵ She said to her, “All that you tell me I will do.” \n"
    6: '⁶ So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law
      had instructed her. '
    7: '⁷ When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and he was in a contented mood, he went to
      lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came stealthily and uncovered
      his feet, and lay down. '
    8: '⁸ At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and there, lying at his
      feet, was a woman! '
    9: '⁹ He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your servant; spread
      your cloak over your servant, for you are next-of-kin.” '
    10: '¹⁰ He said, “May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter; this last instance
      of your loyalty is better than the first; you have not gone after young men,
      whether poor or rich. '
    11: '¹¹ And now, my daughter, do not be afraid, I will do for you all that you
      ask, for all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman. '
    12: '¹² But now, though it is true that I am a near kinsman, there is another
      kinsman more closely related than I. '
    13: "¹³ Remain this night, and in the morning, if he will act as next-of-kin for\
      \ you, good; let him do it. If he is not willing to act as next-of-kin for you,\
      \ then, as the Lord lives, I will act as next-of-kin for you. Lie down until\
      \ the morning.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before one person could
      recognize another; for he said, “It must not be known that the woman came to
      the threshing floor.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then he said, “Bring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out.” So she
      held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and put it on her back;
      then he went into the city. '
    16: '¹⁶ She came to her mother-in-law, who said, “How did things go with you,
      my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her, '
    17: '¹⁷ saying, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, ‘Do not
      go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” '
    18: ¹⁸ She replied, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out,
      for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today.”
  4:
    1: '¹ No sooner had Boaz gone up to the gate and sat down there than the next-of-kin,
      of whom Boaz had spoken, came passing by. So Boaz said, “Come over, friend;
      sit down here.” And he went over and sat down. '
    2: '² Then Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here”;
      so they sat down. '
    3: '³ He then said to the next-of-kin, “Naomi, who has come back from the country
      of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our kinsman Elimelech. '
    4: '⁴ So I thought I would tell you of it, and say: Buy it in the presence of
      those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will
      redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, so that I may know; for
      there is no one prior to you to redeem it, and I come after you.” So he said,
      “I will redeem it.” '
    5: '⁵ Then Boaz said, “The day you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you
      are also acquiring Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead man, to maintain
      the dead man’s name on his inheritance.” '
    6: "⁶ At this, the next-of-kin said, “I cannot redeem it for myself without damaging\
      \ my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem\
      \ it.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and
      exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one took off a sandal and gave it
      to the other; this was the manner of attesting in Israel. '
    8: '⁸ So when the next-of-kin said to Boaz, “Acquire it for yourself,” he took
      off his sandal. '
    9: '⁹ Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses
      that I have acquired from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and
      all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. '
    10: '¹⁰ I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife,
      to maintain the dead man’s name on his inheritance, in order that the name of
      the dead may not be cut off from his kindred and from the gate of his native
      place; today you are witnesses.” '
    11: '¹¹ Then all the people who were at the gate, along with the elders, said,
      “We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your house
      like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you produce
      children in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem; '
    12: "¹² and, through the children that the Lord will give you by this young woman,\
      \ may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.” \n"
    13: '¹³ So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When they came together, the
      Lord made her conceive, and she bore a son. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you
      this day without next-of-kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel! '
    15: '¹⁵ He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age;
      for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons,
      has borne him.” '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse. '
    17: "¹⁷ The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been\
      \ born to Naomi.” They named him Obed; he became the father of Jesse, the father\
      \ of David. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron, '
    19: '¹⁹ Hezron of Ram, Ram of Amminadab, '
    20: '²⁰ Amminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon, '
    21: '²¹ Salmon of Boaz, Boaz of Obed, '
    22: ²² Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David.
