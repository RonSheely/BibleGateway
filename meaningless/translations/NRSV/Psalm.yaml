      \ day and night.\n"
    4: "³ They are like trees\n    planted by streams of water,\nwhich yield their\
      \ fruit in its season,\n    and their leaves do not wither.\nIn all that they\
      \ do, they prosper. \n"
    5: "⁴ The wicked are not so,\n    but are like chaff that the wind drives away.\n"
    6: "⁵ Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\n    nor sinners in\
