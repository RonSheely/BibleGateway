2 John:
  1:
    1: '¹ The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth,
      and not only I but also all who know the truth, '
    2: "² because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: \n"
    3: "³ Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus\
      \ Christ, the Father’s Son, in truth and love. \n"
    4: '⁴ I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just
      as we have been commanded by the Father. '
    5: '⁵ But now, dear lady, I ask you, not as though I were writing you a new commandment,
      but one we have had from the beginning, let us love one another. '
    6: "⁶ And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the\
      \ commandment just as you have heard it from the beginning—you must walk in\
      \ it. \n"
    7: '⁷ Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that
      Jesus Christ has come in the flesh; any such person is the deceiver and the
      antichrist! '
    8: '⁸ Be on your guard, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but may
      receive a full reward. '
    9: '⁹ Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ, but goes beyond it,
      does not have God; whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the
      Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ Do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does
      not bring this teaching; '
    11: "¹¹ for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person. \n"
    12: "¹² Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and\
      \ ink; instead I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that\
      \ our joy may be complete. \n"
    13: ¹³ The children of your elect sister send you their greetings.
