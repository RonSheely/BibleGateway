Hebrews:
  1:
    1: '¹ Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, '
    2: '² but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir
      of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. '
    3: '³ He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of God’s very
      being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification
      for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, '
    4: "⁴ having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is\
      \ more excellent than theirs. \n"
    5: "⁵ For to which of the angels did God ever say,\n“You are my Son;\n    today\
      \ I have begotten you”?\nOr again,\n“I will be his Father,\n    and he will\
      \ be my Son”? \n"
    6: "⁶ And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,\n“Let all\
      \ God’s angels worship him.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Of the angels he says,\n“He makes his angels winds,\n    and his servants\
      \ flames of fire.” \n"
    8: "⁸ But of the Son he says,\n“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,\n   \
      \ and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.\n"
    9: "⁹ You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;\ntherefore God, your\
      \ God, has anointed you\n    with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And,\n“In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth,\n    and the heavens\
      \ are the work of your hands;\n"
    11: "¹¹ they will perish, but you remain;\n    they will all wear out like clothing;\n"
    12: "¹² like a cloak you will roll them up,\n    and like clothing they will be\
      \ changed.\nBut you are the same,\n    and your years will never end.” \n"
    13: "¹³ But to which of the angels has he ever said,\n“Sit at my right hand\n\
      \    until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”? \n"
    14: ¹⁴ Are not all angels spirits in the divine service, sent to serve for the
      sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
  2:
    1: '¹ Therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard, so that we
      do not drift away from it. '
    2: '² For if the message declared through angels was valid, and every transgression
      or disobedience received a just penalty, '
    3: '³ how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? It was declared at
      first through the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, '
    4: "⁴ while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles,\
      \ and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributed according to his will. \n"
    5: '⁵ Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to
      angels. '
    6: "⁶ But someone has testified somewhere,\n“What are human beings that you are\
      \ mindful of them,\n    or mortals, that you care for them?\n"
    7: "⁷ You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;\n    you have\
      \ crowned them with glory and honor,\n"
    8: "⁸     subjecting all things under their feet.”\nNow in subjecting all things\
      \ to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see\
      \ everything in subjection to them, "
    9: "⁹ but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels,\
      \ now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that\
      \ by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in
      bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation
      perfect through sufferings. '
    11: '¹¹ For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father.
      For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, '
    12: "¹² saying,\n“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters,\n    in\
      \ the midst of the congregation I will praise you.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And again,\n“I will put my trust in him.”\nAnd again,\n“Here am I and\
      \ the children whom God has given me.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise
      shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has
      the power of death, that is, the devil, '
    15: '¹⁵ and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of
      death. '
    16: '¹⁶ For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants
      of Abraham. '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect,
      so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God,
      to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. '
    18: ¹⁸ Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those
      who are being tested.
  3:
    1: '¹ Therefore, brothers and sisters, holy partners in a heavenly calling, consider
      that Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, '
    2: '² was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also “was faithful
      in all God’s house.” '
    3: '³ Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house
      has more honor than the house itself. '
    4: '⁴ (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) '
    5: '⁵ Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the
      things that would be spoken later. '
    6: "⁶ Christ, however, was faithful over God’s house as a son, and we are his\
      \ house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope. \n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\n"
    8: "⁸ do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,\n    as on the day of testing\
      \ in the wilderness,\n"
    9: "⁹ where your ancestors put me to the test,\n    though they had seen my works "
    10: "¹⁰ for forty years.\nTherefore I was angry with that generation,\nand I said,\
      \ ‘They always go astray in their hearts,\n    and they have not known my ways.’\n"
    11: "¹¹ As in my anger I swore,\n    ‘They will not enter my rest.’” \n"
    12: '¹² Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you may have an evil, unbelieving
      heart that turns away from the living God. '
    13: '¹³ But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” so
      that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. '
    14: '¹⁴ For we have become partners of Christ, if only we hold our first confidence
      firm to the end. '
    15: "¹⁵ As it is said,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts\
      \ as in the rebellion.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those
      who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses? '
    17: '¹⁷ But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose
      bodies fell in the wilderness? '
    18: '¹⁸ And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to
      those who were disobedient? '
    19: ¹⁹ So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
  4:
    1: '¹ Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest is still open, let us
      take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it. '
    2: '² For indeed the good news came to us just as to them; but the message they
      heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those
      who listened. '
    3: "³ For we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said,\n“As in\
      \ my anger I swore,\n‘They shall not enter my rest,’”\nthough his works were\
      \ finished at the foundation of the world. "
    4: '⁴ For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows, “And God rested
      on the seventh day from all his works.” '
    5: '⁵ And again in this place it says, “They shall not enter my rest.” '
    6: '⁶ Since therefore it remains open for some to enter it, and those who formerly
      received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, '
    7: "⁷ again he sets a certain day—“today”—saying through David much later, in\
      \ the words already quoted,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your\
      \ hearts.” \n"
    8: '⁸ For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later about another
      day. '
    9: '⁹ So then, a sabbath rest still remains for the people of God; '
    10: '¹⁰ for those who enter God’s rest also cease from their labors as God did
      from his. '
    11: "¹¹ Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one\
      \ may fall through such disobedience as theirs. \n"
    12: '¹² Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged
      sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is
      able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. '
    13: "¹³ And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare\
      \ to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,
      Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. '
    15: '¹⁵ For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our
      weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are,
      yet without sin. '
    16: ¹⁶ Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we
      may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
  5:
    1: '¹ Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining
      to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. '
    2: '² He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself
      is subject to weakness; '
    3: '³ and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as
      for those of the people. '
    4: "⁴ And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called\
      \ by God, just as Aaron was. \n"
    5: "⁵ So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was\
      \ appointed by the one who said to him,\n“You are my Son,\n    today I have\
      \ begotten you”; \n"
    6: "⁶ as he says also in another place,\n“You are a priest forever,\n    according\
      \ to the order of Melchizedek.” \n"
    7: '⁷ In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with
      loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he
      was heard because of his reverent submission. '
    8: '⁸ Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; '
    9: '⁹ and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation
      for all who obey him, '
    10: "¹⁰ having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of\
      \ Melchizedek. \n"
    11: '¹¹ About this we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have
      become dull in understanding. '
    12: '¹² For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to
      teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of God. You need milk, not
      solid food; '
    13: '¹³ for everyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is unskilled in
      the word of righteousness. '
    14: ¹⁴ But solid food is for the mature, for those whose faculties have been trained
      by practice to distinguish good from evil.
  6:
    1: '¹ Therefore let us go on toward perfection, leaving behind the basic teaching
      about Christ, and not laying again the foundation: repentance from dead works
      and faith toward God, '
    2: '² instruction about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead,
      and eternal judgment. '
    3: '³ And we will do this, if God permits. '
    4: '⁴ For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once
      been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the
      Holy Spirit, '
    5: '⁵ and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age
      to come, '
    6: '⁶ and then have fallen away, since on their own they are crucifying again
      the Son of God and are holding him up to contempt. '
    7: '⁷ Ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly, and that produces
      a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. '
    8: "⁸ But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and on the verge\
      \ of being cursed; its end is to be burned over. \n"
    9: '⁹ Even though we speak in this way, beloved, we are confident of better things
      in your case, things that belong to salvation. '
    10: '¹⁰ For God is not unjust; he will not overlook your work and the love that
      you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do. '
    11: '¹¹ And we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize
      the full assurance of hope to the very end, '
    12: "¹² so that you may not become sluggish, but imitators of those who through\
      \ faith and patience inherit the promises. \n"
    13: '¹³ When God made a promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom
      to swear, he swore by himself, '
    14: '¹⁴ saying, “I will surely bless you and multiply you.” '
    15: '¹⁵ And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise. '
    16: '¹⁶ Human beings, of course, swear by someone greater than themselves, and
      an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute. '
    17: '¹⁷ In the same way, when God desired to show even more clearly to the heirs
      of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it by
      an oath, '
    18: '¹⁸ so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that
      God would prove false, we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged
      to seize the hope set before us. '
    19: '¹⁹ We have this hope, a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that
      enters the inner shrine behind the curtain, '
    20: ²⁰ where Jesus, a forerunner on our behalf, has entered, having become a high
      priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
  7:
    1: '¹ This “King Melchizedek of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham
      as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him”; '
    2: '² and to him Abraham apportioned “one-tenth of everything.” His name, in the
      first place, means “king of righteousness”; next he is also king of Salem, that
      is, “king of peace.” '
    3: "³ Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning\
      \ of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest\
      \ forever. \n"
    4: '⁴ See how great he is! Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the
      spoils. '
    5: '⁵ And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment
      in the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their kindred, though
      these also are descended from Abraham. '
    6: '⁶ But this man, who does not belong to their ancestry, collected tithes from
      Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises. '
    7: '⁷ It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. '
    8: '⁸ In the one case, tithes are received by those who are mortal; in the other,
      by one of whom it is testified that he lives. '
    9: '⁹ One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through
      Abraham, '
    10: "¹⁰ for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthood—for
      the people received the law under this priesthood—what further need would there
      have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek,
      rather than one according to the order of Aaron? '
    12: '¹² For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change
      in the law as well. '
    13: '¹³ Now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe,
      from which no one has ever served at the altar. '
    14: "¹⁴ For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection\
      \ with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ It is even more obvious when another priest arises, resembling Melchizedek, '
    16: '¹⁶ one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning
      physical descent, but through the power of an indestructible life. '
    17: "¹⁷ For it is attested of him,\n“You are a priest forever,\n    according\
      \ to the order of Melchizedek.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ There is, on the one hand, the abrogation of an earlier commandment because
      it was weak and ineffectual '
    19: "¹⁹ (for the law made nothing perfect); there is, on the other hand, the introduction\
      \ of a better hope, through which we approach God. \n"
    20: '²⁰ This was confirmed with an oath; for others who became priests took their
      office without an oath, '
    21: "²¹ but this one became a priest with an oath, because of the one who said\
      \ to him,\n“The Lord has sworn\n    and will not change his mind,\n‘You are\
      \ a priest forever’”— \n"
    22: "²² accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were
      prevented by death from continuing in office; '
    24: '²⁴ but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. '
    25: "²⁵ Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through\
      \ him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. \n"
    26: '²⁶ For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless,
      undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. '
    27: '²⁷ Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day
      after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he
      did once for all when he offered himself. '
    28: ²⁸ For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness,
      but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who
      has been made perfect forever.
  8:
    1: '¹ Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest,
      one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, '
    2: '² a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the Lord, and not any
      mortal, has set up. '
    3: '³ For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence
      it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. '
    4: '⁴ Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are
      priests who offer gifts according to the law. '
    5: '⁵ They offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly
      one; for Moses, when he was about to erect the tent, was warned, “See that you
      make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.” '
    6: '⁶ But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree
      he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted through better
      promises. '
    7: "⁷ For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no\
      \ need to look for a second one. \n"
    8: "⁸ God finds fault with them when he says:\n“The days are surely coming, says\
      \ the Lord,\n    when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel\n\
      \    and with the house of Judah;\n"
    9: "⁹ not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors,\n    on the day\
      \ when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;\nfor they\
      \ did not continue in my covenant,\n    and so I had no concern for them, says\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel\n    after\
      \ those days, says the Lord:\nI will put my laws in their minds,\n    and write\
      \ them on their hearts,\nand I will be their God,\n    and they shall be my\
      \ people.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And they shall not teach one another\n    or say to each other, ‘Know\
      \ the Lord,’\nfor they shall all know me,\n    from the least of them to the\
      \ greatest.\n"
    12: "¹² For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,\n    and I will remember\
      \ their sins no more.” \n"
    13: ¹³ In speaking of “a new covenant,” he has made the first one obsolete. And
      what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. '
    2: '² For a tent was constructed, the first one, in which were the lampstand,
      the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place. '
    3: '³ Behind the second curtain was a tent called the Holy of Holies. '
    4: '⁴ In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid
      on all sides with gold, in which there were a golden urn holding the manna,
      and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; '
    5: "⁵ above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these\
      \ things we cannot speak now in detail. \n"
    6: '⁶ Such preparations having been made, the priests go continually into the
      first tent to carry out their ritual duties; '
    7: '⁷ but only the high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and
      not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed
      unintentionally by the people. '
    8: '⁸ By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not
      yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing. '
    9: '⁹ This is a symbol of the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices
      are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, '
    10: "¹⁰ but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms, regulations for\
      \ the body imposed until the time comes to set things right. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come,
      then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not
      of this creation), '
    12: '¹² he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats
      and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. '
    13: '¹³ For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes
      of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, '
    14: "¹⁴ how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit\
      \ offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works\
      \ to worship the living God! \n"
    15: '¹⁵ For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who
      are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has
      occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant. '
    16: '¹⁶ Where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. '
    17: '¹⁷ For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long
      as the one who made it is alive. '
    18: '¹⁸ Hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. '
    19: '¹⁹ For when every commandment had been told to all the people by Moses in
      accordance with the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and
      scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people, '
    20: '²⁰ saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you.” '
    21: '²¹ And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all
      the vessels used in worship. '
    22: "²² Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without\
      \ the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. \n"
    23: '²³ Thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified
      with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices
      than these. '
    24: '²⁴ For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, a mere copy
      of the true one, but he entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence
      of God on our behalf. '
    25: '²⁵ Nor was it to offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters
      the Holy Place year after year with blood that is not his own; '
    26: '²⁶ for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation
      of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age
      to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself. '
    27: '²⁷ And just as it is appointed for mortals to die once, and after that the
      judgment, '
    28: ²⁸ so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear
      a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are eagerly waiting
      for him.
  10:
    1: '¹ Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true
      form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually
      offered year after year, make perfect those who approach. '
    2: '² Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered, since the worshipers,
      cleansed once for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sin? '
    3: '³ But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year. '
    4: '⁴ For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. '
    5: "⁵ Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,\n“Sacrifices and\
      \ offerings you have not desired,\n    but a body you have prepared for me;\n"
    6: "⁶ in burnt offerings and sin offerings\n    you have taken no pleasure.\n"
    7: "⁷ Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, O God’\n    (in the\
      \ scroll of the book it is written of me).” \n"
    8: '⁸ When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices
      and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according
      to the law), '
    9: '⁹ then he added, “See, I have come to do your will.” He abolishes the first
      in order to establish the second. '
    10: "¹⁰ And it is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering\
      \ of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And every priest stands day after day at his service, offering again and
      again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins. '
    12: '¹² But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins,
      “he sat down at the right hand of God,” '
    13: '¹³ and since then has been waiting “until his enemies would be made a footstool
      for his feet.” '
    14: '¹⁴ For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “This is the covenant that I will make with them\n    after those days,\
      \ says the Lord:\nI will put my laws in their hearts,\n    and I will write\
      \ them on their minds,” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ he also adds,\n“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no\
      \ more.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for\
      \ sin. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary
      by the blood of Jesus, '
    20: '²⁰ by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that
      is, through his flesh), '
    21: '²¹ and since we have a great priest over the house of God, '
    22: '²² let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our
      hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure
      water. '
    23: '²³ Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he
      who has promised is faithful. '
    24: '²⁴ And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, '
    25: "²⁵ not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging\
      \ one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching. \n"
    26: '²⁶ For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge
      of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, '
    27: '²⁷ but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume
      the adversaries. '
    28: '²⁸ Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony
      of two or three witnesses.” '
    29: '²⁹ How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have
      spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were
      sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace? '
    30: '³⁰ For we know the one who said, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.” And again,
      “The Lord will judge his people.” '
    31: "³¹ It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. \n"
    32: '³² But recall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you
      endured a hard struggle with sufferings, '
    33: '³³ sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes
      being partners with those so treated. '
    34: '³⁴ For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully
      accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed
      something better and more lasting. '
    35: '³⁵ Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great
      reward. '
    36: '³⁶ For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you
      may receive what was promised. '
    37: "³⁷ For yet\n“in a very little while,\n    the one who is coming will come\
      \ and will not delay;\n"
    38: "³⁸ but my righteous one will live by faith.\n    My soul takes no pleasure\
      \ in anyone who shrinks back.” \n"
    39: ³⁹ But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those
      who have faith and so are saved.
  11:
    1: '¹ Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things
      not seen. '
    2: '² Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval. '
    3: "³ By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God,\
      \ so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible. \n"
    4: '⁴ By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain’s. Through
      this he received approval as righteous, God himself giving approval to his gifts;
      he died, but through his faith he still speaks. '
    5: '⁵ By faith Enoch was taken so that he did not experience death; and “he was
      not found, because God had taken him.” For it was attested before he was taken
      away that “he had pleased God.” '
    6: '⁶ And without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would approach
      him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. '
    7: "⁷ By faith Noah, warned by God about events as yet unseen, respected the warning\
      \ and built an ark to save his household; by this he condemned the world and\
      \ became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith. \n"
    8: '⁸ By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he
      was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. '
    9: '⁹ By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a
      foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him
      of the same promise. '
    10: '¹⁰ For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect
      and builder is God. '
    11: '¹¹ By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old—and
      Sarah herself was barren—because he considered him faithful who had promised. '
    12: "¹² Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were\
      \ born, “as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand\
      \ by the seashore.” \n"
    13: '¹³ All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from
      a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers
      and foreigners on the earth, '
    14: '¹⁴ for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a
      homeland. '
    15: '¹⁵ If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they
      would have had opportunity to return. '
    16: "¹⁶ But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore\
      \ God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city\
      \ for them. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac. He who had received
      the promises was ready to offer up his only son, '
    18: '¹⁸ of whom he had been told, “It is through Isaac that descendants shall
      be named for you.” '
    19: '¹⁹ He considered the fact that God is able even to raise someone from the
      dead—and figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. '
    20: '²⁰ By faith Isaac invoked blessings for the future on Jacob and Esau. '
    21: '²¹ By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, “bowing
      in worship over the top of his staff.” '
    22: "²² By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of\
      \ the Israelites and gave instructions about his burial. \n"
    23: '²³ By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after his birth,
      because they saw that the child was beautiful; and they were not afraid of the
      king’s edict. '
    24: '²⁴ By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh’s
      daughter, '
    25: '²⁵ choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to
      enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. '
    26: '²⁶ He considered abuse suffered for the Christ to be greater wealth than
      the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to the reward. '
    27: '²⁷ By faith he left Egypt, unafraid of the king’s anger; for he persevered
      as though he saw him who is invisible. '
    28: "²⁸ By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the\
      \ destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. \n"
    29: '²⁹ By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as if it were dry land,
      but when the Egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned. '
    30: '³⁰ By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven
      days. '
    31: "³¹ By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient,\
      \ because she had received the spies in peace. \n"
    32: '³² And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon,
      Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets— '
    33: '³³ who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises,
      shut the mouths of lions, '
    34: '³⁴ quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out
      of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. '
    35: '³⁵ Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing
      to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection. '
    36: '³⁶ Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. '
    37: '³⁷ They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by
      the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted,
      tormented— '
    38: "³⁸ of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains,\
      \ and in caves and holes in the ground. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive
      what was promised, '
    40: ⁴⁰ since God had provided something better so that they would not, apart from
      us, be made perfect.
  12:
    1: '¹ Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let
      us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us
      run with perseverance the race that is set before us, '
    2: "² looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake\
      \ of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame,\
      \ and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God. \n"
    3: '³ Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so
      that you may not grow weary or lose heart. '
    4: '⁴ In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding
      your blood. '
    5: "⁵ And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children—\n\
      “My child, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,\n    or lose heart\
      \ when you are punished by him;\n"
    6: "⁶ for the Lord disciplines those whom he loves,\n    and chastises every child\
      \ whom he accepts.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Endure trials for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as children;
      for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline? '
    8: '⁸ If you do not have that discipline in which all children share, then you
      are illegitimate and not his children. '
    9: '⁹ Moreover, we had human parents to discipline us, and we respected them.
      Should we not be even more willing to be subject to the Father of spirits and
      live? '
    10: '¹⁰ For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he
      disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share his holiness. '
    11: "¹¹ Now, discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time,\
      \ but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have\
      \ been trained by it. \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, '
    13: "¹³ and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be\
      \ put out of joint, but rather be healed. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will
      see the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no root of
      bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and through it many become defiled. '
    16: '¹⁶ See to it that no one becomes like Esau, an immoral and godless person,
      who sold his birthright for a single meal. '
    17: "¹⁷ You know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected,\
      \ for he found no chance to repent, even though he sought the blessing with\
      \ tears. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and
      darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, '
    19: '¹⁹ and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg
      that not another word be spoken to them. '
    20: '²⁰ (For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even an animal
      touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death.” '
    21: '²¹ Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”) '
    22: '²² But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the
      heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, '
    23: '²³ and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to
      God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, '
    24: "²⁴ and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood\
      \ that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. \n"
    25: '²⁵ See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking; for if they did not
      escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will
      we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven! '
    26: '²⁶ At that time his voice shook the earth; but now he has promised, “Yet
      once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.” '
    27: '²⁷ This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what is shaken—that
      is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain. '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let
      us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence
      and awe; '
    29: ²⁹ for indeed our God is a consuming fire.
  13:
    1: '¹ Let mutual love continue. '
    2: '² Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some
      have entertained angels without knowing it. '
    3: '³ Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them;
      those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured. '
    4: '⁴ Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled;
      for God will judge fornicators and adulterers. '
    5: '⁵ Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you
      have; for he has said, “I will never leave you or forsake you.” '
    6: "⁶ So we can say with confidence,\n“The Lord is my helper;\n    I will not\
      \ be afraid.\nWhat can anyone do to me?” \n"
    7: '⁷ Remember your leaders, those who spoke the word of God to you; consider
      the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. '
    8: '⁸ Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. '
    9: '⁹ Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings; for it is well
      for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by regulations about food, which
      have not benefited those who observe them. '
    10: '¹⁰ We have an altar from which those who officiate in the tent have no right
      to eat. '
    11: '¹¹ For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary
      by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp. '
    12: '¹² Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify
      the people by his own blood. '
    13: '¹³ Let us then go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured. '
    14: '¹⁴ For here we have no lasting city, but we are looking for the city that
      is to come. '
    15: '¹⁵ Through him, then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God,
      that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name. '
    16: "¹⁶ Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices\
      \ are pleasing to God. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over\
      \ your souls and will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with\
      \ sighing—for that would be harmful to you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Pray for us; we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to
      act honorably in all things. '
    19: "¹⁹ I urge you all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you very\
      \ soon. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus,
      the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, '
    21: "²¹ make you complete in everything good so that you may do his will, working\
      \ among us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom\
      \ be the glory forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    22: '²² I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, bear with my word of exhortation,
      for I have written to you briefly. '
    23: '²³ I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been set free; and if
      he comes in time, he will be with me when I see you. '
    24: '²⁴ Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings. '
    25: ²⁵ Grace be with all of you.
