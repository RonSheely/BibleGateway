  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,\
      \ \n"
    2: "² To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace\
      \ be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    3: "³ We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always\
      \ for you, \n"
    4: "⁴ Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have\
      \ to all the saints, \n"
    5: "⁵ For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before\
      \ in the word of the truth of the gospel; \n"
    6: "⁶ Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit,\
      \ as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of\
      \ God in truth: \n"
    7: "⁷ As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a\
      \ faithful minister of Christ; \n"
    8: "⁸ Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. \n"
    9: "⁹ For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray\
      \ for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will\
      \ in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful\
      \ in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; \n"
    11: "¹¹ Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all\
      \ patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; \n"
    12: "¹² Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers\
      \ of the inheritance of the saints in light: \n"
    13: "¹³ Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated\
      \ us into the kingdom of his dear Son: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of\
      \ sins: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in\
      \ earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,\
      \ or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the\
      \ firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; \n"
    20: "²⁰ And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile\
      \ all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or\
      \ things in heaven. \n"
    21: "²¹ And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked\
      \ works, yet now hath he reconciled \n"
    22: "²² In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable\
      \ and unreproveable in his sight: \n"
    23: "²³ If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away\
      \ from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to\
      \ every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; \n"
    24: "²⁴ Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind\
      \ of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the\
      \ church: \n"
    25: "²⁵ Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which\
      \ is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; \n"
    26: "²⁶ Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but\
      \ now is made manifest to his saints: \n"
    27: "²⁷ To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery\
      \ among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: \n"
    28: "²⁸ Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom;\
      \ that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: \n"
    29: ²⁹ Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh
      in me mightily.
  2:
    1: "¹ For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them\
      \ at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; \n"
    2: "² That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto\
      \ all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement\
      \ of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; \n"
    3: "³ In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. \n"
    4: "⁴ And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. \n"
    5: "⁵ For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying\
      \ and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. \n"
    6: "⁶ As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been\
      \ taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. \n"
    8: "⁸ Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after\
      \ the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and\
      \ power: \n"
    11: "¹¹ In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands,\
      \ in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through\
      \ the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. \n"
    13: "¹³ And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,\
      \ hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which\
      \ was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly,\
      \ triumphing over them in it. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of\
      \ an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping\
      \ of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed\
      \ up by his fleshly mind, \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands\
      \ having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase\
      \ of God. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why,\
      \ as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, \n"
    21: "²¹ (Touch not; taste not; handle not; \n"
    22: "²² Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines\
      \ of men? \n"
    23: '²³ Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility,
      and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.'
  3:
    1: "¹ If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where\
      \ Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. \n"
    2: "² Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. \n"
    3: "³ For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. \n"
    4: "⁴ When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with\
      \ him in glory. \n"
    5: "⁵ Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness,\
      \ inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. \n"
    8: "⁸ But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy\
      \ communication out of your mouth. \n"
    9: "⁹ Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his\
      \ deeds; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image\
      \ of him that created him: \n"
    11: "¹¹ Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,\
      \ Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. \n"
    12: "¹² Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies,\
      \ kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; \n"
    13: "¹³ Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel\
      \ against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are\
      \ called in one body; and be ye thankful. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and\
      \ admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with\
      \ grace in your hearts to the Lord. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,\
      \ giving thanks to God and the Father by him. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not\
      \ with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance:\
      \ for ye serve the Lord Christ. \n"
    25: '²⁵ But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done:
      and there is no respect of persons.'
  4:
    1: "¹ Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that\
      \ ye also have a Master in heaven. \n"
    2: "² Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; \n"
    3: "³ Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance,\
      \ to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: \n"
    4: "⁴ That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. \n"
    5: "⁵ Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. \n"
    6: "⁶ Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know\
      \ how ye ought to answer every man. \n"
    7: "⁷ All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother,\
      \ and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: \n"
    8: "⁸ Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your\
      \ estate, and comfort your hearts; \n"
    9: "⁹ With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall\
      \ make known unto you all things which are done here. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to\
      \ Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive\
      \ him;) \n"
    11: "¹¹ And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These\
      \ only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort\
      \ unto me. \n"
    12: "¹² Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always\
      \ labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete\
      \ in all the will of God. \n"
    13: "¹³ For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that\
      \ are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church\
      \ which is in his house. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in\
      \ the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received\
      \ in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with
      you. Amen.
