Jude:
  1:
    1: "¹ Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are\
      \ sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called: \n"
    2: "² Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. \n"
    3: "³ Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation,\
      \ it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly\
      \ contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. \n"
    4: "⁴ For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained\
      \ to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness,\
      \ and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    5: "⁵ I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that\
      \ the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed\
      \ them that believed not. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation,\
      \ he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of\
      \ the great day. \n"
    7: "⁷ Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving\
      \ themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth\
      \ for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. \n"
    8: "⁸ Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion,\
      \ and speak evil of dignities. \n"
    9: "⁹ Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about\
      \ the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said,\
      \ The Lord rebuke thee. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they\
      \ know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily\
      \ after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding\
      \ themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds;\
      \ trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the\
      \ roots; \n"
    13: "¹³ Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars,\
      \ to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold,\
      \ the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, \n"
    15: "¹⁵ To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among\
      \ them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of\
      \ all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their\
      \ mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because\
      \ of advantage. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles\
      \ of our Lord Jesus Christ; \n"
    18: "¹⁸ How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should\
      \ walk after their own ungodly lusts. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying\
      \ in the Holy Ghost, \n"
    21: "²¹ Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord\
      \ Jesus Christ unto eternal life. \n"
    22: "²² And of some have compassion, making a difference: \n"
    23: "²³ And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the\
      \ garment spotted by the flesh. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you\
      \ faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, \n"
    25: ²⁵ To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
      both now and ever. Amen.
