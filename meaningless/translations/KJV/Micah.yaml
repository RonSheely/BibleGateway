Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham,\
      \ Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let\
      \ the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. \n"
    3: "³ For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come down,\
      \ and tread upon the high places of the earth. \n"
    4: "⁴ And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft,\
      \ as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house\
      \ of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what\
      \ are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? \n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings\
      \ of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and\
      \ I will discover the foundations thereof. \n"
    7: "⁷ And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the\
      \ hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will\
      \ I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall\
      \ return to the hire of an harlot. \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make\
      \ a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. \n"
    9: "⁹ For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the\
      \ gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah\
      \ roll thyself in the dust. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant\
      \ of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of\
      \ you his standing. \n"
    12: "¹² For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came\
      \ down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem. \n"
    13: "¹³ O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she\
      \ is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions\
      \ of Israel were found in thee. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib\
      \ shall be a lie to the kings of Israel. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall\
      \ come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. \n"
    16: ¹⁶ Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness
      as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
  2:
    1: "¹ Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the\
      \ morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them\
      \ away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. \n"
    3: "³ Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an\
      \ evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily:\
      \ for this time is evil. \n"
    4: "⁴ In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful\
      \ lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of\
      \ my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our\
      \ fields. \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy\
      \ to them, that they shall not take shame. \n"
    7: "⁷ O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the Lord straitened?\
      \ are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with\
      \ the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. \n"
    9: "⁹ The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from\
      \ their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted,\
      \ it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. \n"
    11: "¹¹ If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy\
      \ unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this\
      \ people. \n"
    12: "¹² I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the\
      \ remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the\
      \ flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of\
      \ the multitude of men. \n"
    13: '¹³ The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed
      through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them,
      and the Lord on the head of them.'
  3:
    1: "¹ And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house\
      \ of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? \n"
    2: "² Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off\
      \ them, and their flesh from off their bones; \n"
    3: "³ Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them;\
      \ and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as\
      \ flesh within the caldron. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he will even\
      \ hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill\
      \ in their doings. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that\
      \ bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their\
      \ mouths, they even prepare war against him. \n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and\
      \ it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go\
      \ down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they\
      \ shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. \n"
    8: "⁸ But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment,\
      \ and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the\
      \ house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for\
      \ hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the\
      \ Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. \n"
    12: ¹² Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem
      shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the
      forest.
  4:
    1: "¹ But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house\
      \ of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall\
      \ be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. \n"
    2: "² And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of\
      \ his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion,\
      \ and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. \n"
    3: "³ And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off;\
      \ and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks:\
      \ nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn\
      \ war any more. \n"
    4: "⁴ But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and\
      \ none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken\
      \ it. \n"
    5: "⁵ For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk\
      \ in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will\
      \ gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; \n"
    7: "⁷ And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off\
      \ a strong nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth,\
      \ even for ever. \n"
    8: "⁸ And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion,\
      \ unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to\
      \ the daughter of Jerusalem. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor\
      \ perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman\
      \ in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell\
      \ in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered;\
      \ there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be\
      \ defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. \n"
    12: "¹² But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his\
      \ counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. \n"
    13: '¹³ Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron,
      and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people:
      and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the
      Lord of the whole earth.'
  5:
    1: "¹ Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against\
      \ us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. \n"
    2: "² But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands\
      \ of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler\
      \ in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. \n"
    3: "³ Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth\
      \ hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the\
      \ children of Israel. \n"
    4: "⁴ And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty\
      \ of the name of the Lord his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be\
      \ great unto the ends of the earth. \n"
    5: "⁵ And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land:\
      \ and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven\
      \ shepherds, and eight principal men. \n"
    6: "⁶ And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of\
      \ Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian,\
      \ when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. \n"
    7: "⁷ And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from\
      \ the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth\
      \ for the sons of men. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many\
      \ people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the\
      \ flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in\
      \ pieces, and none can deliver. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies\
      \ shall be cut off. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut\
      \ off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong\
      \ holds: \n"
    12: "¹² And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have\
      \ no more soothsayers: \n"
    13: "¹³ Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of\
      \ the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy\
      \ thy cities. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as
      they have not heard.
  6:
    1: "¹ Hear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains,\
      \ and let the hills hear thy voice. \n"
    2: "² Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong foundations\
      \ of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and he will\
      \ plead with Israel. \n"
    3: "³ O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee?\
      \ testify against me. \n"
    4: "⁴ For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of\
      \ the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. \n"
    5: "⁵ O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam\
      \ the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the\
      \ righteousness of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God?\
      \ shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? \n"
    7: "⁷ Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of\
      \ rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of\
      \ my body for the sin of my soul? \n"
    8: "⁸ He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require\
      \ of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy\
      \ God? \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy\
      \ name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,\
      \ and the scant measure that is abominable? \n"
    11: "¹¹ Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of\
      \ deceitful weights? \n"
    12: "¹² For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof\
      \ have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate\
      \ because of thy sins. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in\
      \ the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that\
      \ which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives,\
      \ but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink\
      \ wine. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab,
      and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the
      inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.'
  7:
    1: "¹ Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the\
      \ grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired\
      \ the firstripe fruit. \n"
    2: "² The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among\
      \ men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with\
      \ a net. \n"
    3: "³ That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and\
      \ the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous\
      \ desire: so they wrap it up. \n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn\
      \ hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their\
      \ perplexity. \n"
    5: "⁵ Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors\
      \ of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. \n"
    6: "⁶ For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her\
      \ mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are\
      \ the men of his own house. \n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation:\
      \ my God will hear me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I\
      \ sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. \n"
    9: "⁹ I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him,\
      \ until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth\
      \ to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which\
      \ said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall\
      \ she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. \n"
    11: "¹¹ In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree\
      \ be far removed. \n"
    12: "¹² In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the\
      \ fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to\
      \ sea, and from mountain to mountain. \n"
    13: "¹³ Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell\
      \ therein, for the fruit of their doings. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell\
      \ solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and\
      \ Gilead, as in the days of old. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew\
      \ unto him marvellous things. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall\
      \ lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their\
      \ holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and\
      \ shall fear because of thee. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the\
      \ transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for\
      \ ever, because he delighteth in mercy. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our\
      \ iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.\
      \ \n"
    20: ²⁰ Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou
      hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
