Psalm:
  1:
    1: "¹ Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth\
      \ in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. \n"
    2: "² But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate\
      \ day and night. \n"
    3: "³ And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth\
      \ forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever\
      \ he doeth shall prosper. \n"
    4: "⁴ The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the\
      \ congregation of the righteous. \n"
    6: '⁶ For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly
      shall perish.'
  2:
    1: "¹ Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? \n"
    2: "² The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together,\
      \ against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, \n"
    3: "³ Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. \n"
    4: "⁴ He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in\
      \ derision. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. \n"
    7: "⁷ I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;\
      \ this day have I begotten thee. \n"
    8: "⁸ Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and\
      \ the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces\
      \ like a potter's vessel. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. \n"
    12: ¹² Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath
      is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
  3:
    1: "¹ Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up\
      \ against me. \n"
    2: "² Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine\
      \ head. \n"
    4: "⁴ I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill.\
      \ Selah. \n"
    5: "⁵ I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. \n"
    6: "⁶ I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves\
      \ against me round about. \n"
    7: "⁷ Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies\
      \ upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. \n"
    8: '⁸ Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.'
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when\
      \ I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. \n"
    2: "² O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will\
      \ ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah. \n"
    3: "³ But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the\
      \ Lord will hear when I call unto him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and\
      \ be still. Selah. \n"
    5: "⁵ Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the\
      \ light of thy countenance upon us. \n"
    7: "⁷ Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn\
      \ and their wine increased. \n"
    8: '⁸ I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest
      me dwell in safety.'
  5:
    1: "¹ Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation. \n"
    2: "² Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will\
      \ I pray. \n"
    3: "³ My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct\
      \ my prayer unto thee, and will look up. \n"
    4: "⁴ For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil\
      \ dwell with thee. \n"
    5: "⁵ The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor the bloody\
      \ and deceitful man. \n"
    7: "⁷ But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy:\
      \ and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. \n"
    8: "⁸ Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy\
      \ way straight before my face. \n"
    9: "⁹ For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness;\
      \ their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them\
      \ out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against\
      \ thee. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever\
      \ shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name\
      \ be joyful in thee. \n"
    12: ¹² For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass
      him as with a shield.
  6:
    1: "¹ O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones\
      \ are vexed. \n"
    3: "³ My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? \n"
    4: "⁴ Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. \n"
    5: "⁵ For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give\
      \ thee thanks? \n"
    6: "⁶ I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water\
      \ my couch with my tears. \n"
    7: "⁷ Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine\
      \ enemies. \n"
    8: "⁸ Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the\
      \ voice of my weeping. \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be
      ashamed suddenly.'
  7:
    1: "¹ O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute\
      \ me, and deliver me: \n"
    2: "² Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none\
      \ to deliver. \n"
    3: "³ O Lord my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; \n"
    4: "⁴ If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have\
      \ delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) \n"
    5: "⁵ Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my\
      \ life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. \n"
    6: "⁶ Arise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine\
      \ enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. \n"
    7: "⁷ So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes\
      \ therefore return thou on high. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord shall judge the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness,\
      \ and according to mine integrity that is in me. \n"
    9: "⁹ Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just:\
      \ for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. \n"
    11: "¹¹ God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made\
      \ it ready. \n"
    13: "¹³ He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his\
      \ arrows against the persecutors. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and\
      \ brought forth falsehood. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall\
      \ come down upon his own pate. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will sing praise
      to the name of the Lord most high.'
  8:
    1: "¹ O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set\
      \ thy glory above the heavens. \n"
    2: "² Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because\
      \ of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. \n"
    3: "³ When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars,\
      \ which thou hast ordained; \n"
    4: "⁴ What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou\
      \ visitest him? \n"
    5: "⁵ For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned\
      \ him with glory and honour. \n"
    6: "⁶ Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast\
      \ put all things under his feet: \n"
    7: "⁷ All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; \n"
    8: "⁸ The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through\
      \ the paths of the seas. \n"
    9: ⁹ O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
  9:
    1: "¹ I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy\
      \ marvellous works. \n"
    2: "² I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou\
      \ most High. \n"
    3: "³ When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne\
      \ judging right. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast\
      \ put out their name for ever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed\
      \ cities; their memorial is perished with them. \n"
    7: "⁷ But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment\
      \ to the people in uprightness. \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord,\
      \ hast not forsaken them that seek thee. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people\
      \ his doings. \n"
    12: "¹² When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth\
      \ not the cry of the humble. \n"
    13: "¹³ Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of them\
      \ that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion:\
      \ I will rejoice in thy salvation. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which\
      \ they hid is their own foot taken. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared\
      \ in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget\
      \ God. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor\
      \ shall not perish for ever. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Put them in fear, O Lord: that the nations may know themselves to be but
      men. Selah.'
  10:
    1: "¹ Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of\
      \ trouble? \n"
    2: "² The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the\
      \ devices that they have imagined. \n"
    3: "³ For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous,\
      \ whom the Lord abhorreth. \n"
    4: "⁴ The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God:\
      \ God is not in all his thoughts. \n"
    5: "⁵ His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight:\
      \ as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. \n"
    6: "⁶ He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in\
      \ adversity. \n"
    7: "⁷ His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief\
      \ and vanity. \n"
    8: "⁸ He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth\
      \ he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. \n"
    9: "⁹ He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch\
      \ the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong\
      \ ones. \n"
    11: "¹¹ He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he\
      \ will never see it. \n"
    12: "¹² Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. \n"
    13: "¹³ Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou\
      \ wilt not require it. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it\
      \ with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper\
      \ of the fatherless. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness\
      \ till thou find none. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his\
      \ land. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their\
      \ heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: \n"
    18: ¹⁸ To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may
      no more oppress.
  11:
    1: "¹ In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your\
      \ mountain? \n"
    2: "² For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the\
      \ string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. \n"
    3: "³ If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? \n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven: his eyes\
      \ behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence\
      \ his soul hateth. \n"
    6: "⁶ Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible\
      \ tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. \n"
    7: ⁷ For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold
      the upright.
  12:
    1: "¹ Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among\
      \ the children of men. \n"
    2: "² They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and\
      \ with a double heart do they speak. \n"
    3: "³ The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh\
      \ proud things: \n"
    4: "⁴ Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who\
      \ is lord over us? \n"
    5: "⁵ For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I\
      \ arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth,\
      \ purified seven times. \n"
    7: "⁷ Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation\
      \ for ever. \n"
    8: ⁸ The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
  13:
    1: "¹ How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide\
      \ thy face from me? \n"
    2: "² How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?\
      \ how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? \n"
    3: "³ Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the\
      \ sleep of death; \n"
    4: "⁴ Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble\
      \ me rejoice when I am moved. \n"
    5: "⁵ But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.\
      \ \n"
    6: ⁶ I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
  14:
    1: "¹ The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they\
      \ have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. \n"
    2: "² The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there\
      \ were any that did understand, and seek God. \n"
    3: "³ They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none\
      \ that doeth good, no, not one. \n"
    4: "⁴ Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they\
      \ eat bread, and call not upon the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge.\
      \ \n"
    7: ⁷ Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the Lord bringeth
      back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
  15:
    1: "¹ Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?\
      \ \n"
    2: "² He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth\
      \ in his heart. \n"
    3: "³ He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour,\
      \ nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. \n"
    4: "⁴ In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear\
      \ the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. \n"
    5: ⁵ He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the
      innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
  16:
    1: "¹ Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. \n"
    2: "² O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth\
      \ not to thee; \n"
    3: "³ But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is\
      \ all my delight. \n"
    4: "⁴ Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink\
      \ offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest\
      \ my lot. \n"
    6: "⁶ The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct\
      \ me in the night seasons. \n"
    8: "⁸ I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I\
      \ shall not be moved. \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall\
      \ rest in hope. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine\
      \ Holy One to see corruption. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy;
      at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.'
  17:
    1: "¹ Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that\
      \ goeth not out of feigned lips. \n"
    2: "² Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the\
      \ things that are equal. \n"
    3: "³ Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast\
      \ tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from\
      \ the paths of the destroyer. \n"
    5: "⁵ Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. \n"
    6: "⁶ I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear\
      \ unto me, and hear my speech. \n"
    7: "⁷ Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand\
      \ them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. \n"
    8: "⁸ Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me\
      \ about. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing\
      \ down to the earth; \n"
    12: "¹² Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion\
      \ lurking in secret places. \n"
    13: "¹³ Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the\
      \ wicked, which is thy sword: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have\
      \ their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure:\
      \ they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their\
      \ babes. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied,
      when I awake, with thy likeness.'
  18:
    1: "¹ I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. \n"
    2: "² The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength,\
      \ in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high\
      \ tower. \n"

    50: "⁵⁰ He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave\

    51: "⁵¹ And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the\

    53: "⁵³ And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed\
      \ their enemies. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain,\
      \ which his right hand had purchased. \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance\
      \ by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:\
      \ \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were\
      \ turned aside like a deceitful bow. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to\
      \ jealousy with their graven images. \n"
    59: "⁵⁹ When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: \n"
    60: "⁶⁰ So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed\
      \ among men; \n"
    61: "⁶¹ And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's\
      \ hand. \n"
    62: "⁶² He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.\

    64: "⁶⁴ Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.\

    65: "⁶⁵ Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth\
      \ by reason of wine. \n"
    66: "⁶⁶ And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual\
      \ reproach. \n"
    67: "⁶⁷ Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe\
      \ of Ephraim: \n"
    68: "⁶⁸ But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. \n"
    69: "⁶⁹ And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he\

    70: "⁷⁰ He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: \n"
    71: "⁷¹ From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob\
      \ his people, and Israel his inheritance. \n"
    72: ⁷² So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them
