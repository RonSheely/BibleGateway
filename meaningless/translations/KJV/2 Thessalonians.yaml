2 Thessalonians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians\
      \ in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: \n"
    2: "² Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because\
      \ that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all\
      \ toward each other aboundeth; \n"
    4: "⁴ So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience\
      \ and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: \n"
    5: "⁵ Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may\
      \ be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: \n"
    6: "⁶ Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them\
      \ that trouble you; \n"
    7: "⁷ And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed\
      \ from heaven with his mighty angels, \n"
    8: "⁸ In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey\
      \ not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: \n"
    9: "⁹ Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of\
      \ the Lord, and from the glory of his power; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in\
      \ all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that\
      \ day. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy\
      \ of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the\
      \ work of faith with power: \n"
    12: ¹² That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye
      in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
  2:
    1: "¹ Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and\
      \ by our gathering together unto him, \n"
    2: "² That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor\
      \ by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. \n"
    3: "³ Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except\
      \ there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son\
      \ of perdition; \n"
    4: "⁴ Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that\
      \ is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself\
      \ that he is God. \n"
    5: "⁵ Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will\
      \ let, until he be taken out of the way. \n"
    8: "⁸ And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with\
      \ the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and\
      \ signs and lying wonders, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because\
      \ they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should\
      \ believe a lie: \n"
    12: "¹² That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure\
      \ in unrighteousness. \n"
    13: "¹³ But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved\
      \ of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through\
      \ sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of\
      \ our Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have\
      \ been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath\
      \ loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through\
      \ grace, \n"
    17: ¹⁷ Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
  3:
    1: "¹ Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free\
      \ course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: \n"
    2: "² And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men\
      \ have not faith. \n"
    3: "³ But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will\
      \ do the things which we command you. \n"
    5: "⁵ And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient\
      \ waiting for Christ. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that\
      \ ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not\
      \ after the tradition which he received of us. \n"
    7: "⁷ For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves\
      \ disorderly among you; \n"
    8: "⁸ Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and\
      \ travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: \n"
    9: "⁹ Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you\
      \ to follow us. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would\
      \ not work, neither should he eat. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working\
      \ not at all, but are busybodies. \n"
    12: "¹² Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ,\
      \ that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. \n"
    13: "¹³ But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have\
      \ no company with him, that he may be ashamed. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The\
      \ Lord be with you all. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every\
      \ epistle: so I write. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
