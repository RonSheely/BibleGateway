    2: "² Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus\
      \ Christ. \n"
    3: "³ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed\
      \ us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: \n"
    4: "⁴ According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,\
      \ that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: \n"
    5: "⁵ Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to\
      \ himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, \n"
    6: "⁶ To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted\
      \ in the beloved. \n"
    7: "⁷ In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according\
      \ to the riches of his grace; \n"
    8: "⁸ Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; \n"
    9: "⁹ Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good\
      \ pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together\
      \ in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;\
      \ even in him: \n"
    11: "¹¹ In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according\
      \ to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own\
      \ will: \n"
    12: "¹² That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel\
      \ of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with\
      \ that holy Spirit of promise, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased\
      \ possession, unto the praise of his glory. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love\
      \ unto all the saints, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto\
      \ you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what\
      \ is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance\
      \ in the saints, \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe,\
      \ according to the working of his mighty power, \n"
    20: "²⁰ Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set\
      \ him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, \n"
    21: "²¹ Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every\
      \ name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over\
      \ all things to the church, \n"
    23: ²³ Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
  2:
    1: "¹ And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; \n"
    2: "² Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according\
      \ to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the\
      \ children of disobedience: \n"
    3: "³ Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of\
      \ our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by\
      \ nature the children of wrath, even as others. \n"
    4: "⁴ But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,\
      \ (by grace ye are saved;) \n"
    6: "⁶ And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places\
      \ in Christ Jesus: \n"
    7: "⁷ That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace\
      \ in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. \n"
    8: "⁸ For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it\
      \ is the gift of God: \n"
    9: "⁹ Not of works, lest any man should boast. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which\
      \ God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh,\
      \ who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in\
      \ the flesh made by hands; \n"
    12: "¹² That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth\
      \ of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and\
      \ without God in the world: \n"
    13: "¹³ But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by\
      \ the blood of Christ. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the\
      \ middle wall of partition between us; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments\
      \ contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making\
      \ peace; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having\
      \ slain the enmity thereby: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that\
      \ were nigh. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens\
      \ with the saints, and of the household of God; \n"
    20: "²⁰ And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus\
      \ Christ himself being the chief corner stone; \n"
    21: "²¹ In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple\
      \ in the Lord: \n"
    22: ²² In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the
      Spirit.
  3:
    1: "¹ For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, \n"
    2: "² If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given\
      \ me to you-ward: \n"
    3: "³ How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore\
      \ in few words, \n"
    4: "⁴ Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of\
      \ Christ) \n"
    5: "⁵ Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now\
      \ revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; \n"
    6: "⁶ That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers\
      \ of his promise in Christ by the gospel: \n"
    7: "⁷ Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God\
      \ given unto me by the effectual working of his power. \n"
    8: "⁸ Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given,\
      \ that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from\
      \ the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by\
      \ Jesus Christ: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly\
      \ places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, \n"
    11: "¹¹ According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our\
      \ Lord: \n"
    12: "¹² In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which\
      \ is your glory. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened\
      \ with might by his Spirit in the inner man; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and\
      \ grounded in love, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length,\
      \ and depth, and height; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might\
      \ be filled with all the fulness of God. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we\
      \ ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, \n"
    21: ²¹ Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world
      without end. Amen.
  4:
    1: "¹ I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of\
      \ the vocation wherewith ye are called, \n"
    2: "² With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another\
      \ in love; \n"
    3: "³ Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. \n"
    4: "⁴ There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of\
      \ your calling; \n"
    5: "⁵ One Lord, one faith, one baptism, \n"
    6: "⁶ One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you\
      \ all. \n"
    7: "⁷ But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the\
      \ gift of Christ. \n"
    8: "⁸ Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive,\
      \ and gave gifts unto men. \n"
    9: "⁹ (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into\
      \ the lower parts of the earth? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens,\
      \ that he might fill all things.) \n"
    11: "¹¹ And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists;\
      \ and some, pastors and teachers; \n"
    12: "¹² For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the\
      \ edifying of the body of Christ: \n"
    13: "¹³ Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the\
      \ Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness\
      \ of Christ: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried\
      \ about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness,\
      \ whereby they lie in wait to deceive; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which\
      \ is the head, even Christ: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which\
      \ every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of\
      \ every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk\
      \ not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God\
      \ through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,\
      \ to work all uncleanness with greediness. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But ye have not so learned Christ; \n"
    21: "²¹ If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth\
      \ is in Jesus: \n"
    22: "²² That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which\
      \ is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; \n"
    23: "²³ And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; \n"
    24: "²⁴ And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness\
      \ and true holiness. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour:\
      \ for we are members one of another. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: \n"
    27: "²⁷ Neither give place to the devil. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with\
      \ his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which\
      \ is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the\
      \ day of redemption. \n"
    31: "³¹ Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking,\
      \ be put away from you, with all malice: \n"
    32: ³² And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even
      as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
  5:
    1: "¹ Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; \n"
    2: "² And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for\
      \ us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. \n"
    3: "³ But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once\
      \ named among you, as becometh saints; \n"
    4: "⁴ Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient:\
      \ but rather giving of thanks. \n"
    5: "⁵ For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous\
      \ man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and\
      \ of God. \n"
    6: "⁶ Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh\
      \ the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. \n"
    7: "⁷ Be not ye therefore partakers with them. \n"
    8: "⁸ For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as\
      \ children of light: \n"
    9: "⁹ (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather\
      \ reprove them. \n"
    12: "¹² For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them\
      \ in secret. \n"
    13: "¹³ But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever\
      \ doth make manifest is light. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,\
      \ and Christ shall give thee light. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord\
      \ is. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the\
      \ Spirit; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing\
      \ and making melody in your heart to the Lord; \n"
    20: "²⁰ Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name\
      \ of our Lord Jesus Christ; \n"
    21: "²¹ Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. \n"
    22: "²² Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n"
    23: "²³ For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of\
      \ the church: and he is the saviour of the body. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to\
      \ their own husbands in every thing. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave\
      \ himself for it; \n"
    26: "²⁶ That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the\
      \ word, \n"
    27: "²⁷ That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot,\
      \ or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his\
      \ wife loveth himself. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth\
      \ it, even as the Lord the church: \n"
    30: "³⁰ For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. \n"
    31: "³¹ For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined\
      \ unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. \n"
    32: "³² This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.\
      \ \n"
    33: ³³ Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as
      himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
  6:
    1: "¹ Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. \n"
    2: "² Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. \n"
    4: "⁴ And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in\
      \ the nurture and admonition of the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh,\
      \ with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; \n"
    6: "⁶ Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing\
      \ the will of God from the heart; \n"
    7: "⁷ With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: \n"
    8: "⁸ Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive\
      \ of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. \n"
    9: "⁹ And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing\
      \ that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with\
      \ him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the\
      \ wiles of the devil. \n"
    12: "¹² For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,\
      \ against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against\
      \ spiritual wickedness in high places. \n"
    13: "¹³ Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to\
      \ withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on\
      \ the breastplate of righteousness; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench\
      \ all the fiery darts of the wicked. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is\
      \ the word of God: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching\
      \ thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth\
      \ boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, \n"
    20: "²⁰ For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly,\
      \ as I ought to speak. \n"
    21: "²¹ But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved\
      \ brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our\
      \ affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. \n"
    23: "²³ Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and\
      \ the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    24: ²⁴ Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
