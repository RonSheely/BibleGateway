3 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. \n"
    2: "² Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health,\
      \ even as thy soul prospereth. \n"
    3: "³ For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth\
      \ that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. \n"
    4: "⁴ I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. \n"
    5: "⁵ Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and\
      \ to strangers; \n"
    6: "⁶ Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou\
      \ bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: \n"
    7: "⁷ Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the\
      \ Gentiles. \n"
    8: "⁸ We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the\
      \ truth. \n"
    9: "⁹ I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence\
      \ among them, receiveth us not. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating\
      \ against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he\
      \ himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth\
      \ them out of the church. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that\
      \ doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. \n"
    12: "¹² Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and\
      \ we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. \n"
    13: "¹³ I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto\
      \ thee: \n"
    14: ¹⁴ But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.
      Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
