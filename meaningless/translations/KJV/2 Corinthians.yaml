2 Corinthians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,\
      \ unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are\
      \ in all Achaia: \n"
    2: "² Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of\
      \ mercies, and the God of all comfort; \n"
    4: "⁴ Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort\
      \ them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted\
      \ of God. \n"
    5: "⁵ For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth\
      \ by Christ. \n"
    6: "⁶ And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which\
      \ is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:\
      \ or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. \n"
    7: "⁷ And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the\
      \ sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. \n"
    8: "⁸ For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came\
      \ to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch\
      \ that we despaired even of life: \n"
    9: "⁹ But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust\
      \ in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust\
      \ that he will yet deliver us; \n"
    11: "¹¹ Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed\
      \ upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity\
      \ and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we\
      \ have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. \n"
    13: "¹³ For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge;\
      \ and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even\
      \ as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might\
      \ have a second benefit; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia\
      \ unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that\
      \ I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should\
      \ be yea yea, and nay nay? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even\
      \ by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the\
      \ glory of God by us. \n"
    21: "²¹ Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us,\
      \ is God; \n"
    22: "²² Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came\
      \ not as yet unto Corinth. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your
      joy: for by faith ye stand.'
  2:
    1: "¹ But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in\
      \ heaviness. \n"
    2: "² For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same\
      \ which is made sorry by me? \n"
    3: "³ And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow\
      \ from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my\
      \ joy is the joy of you all. \n"
    4: "⁴ For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many\
      \ tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which\
      \ I have more abundantly unto you. \n"
    5: "⁵ But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that\
      \ I may not overcharge you all. \n"
    6: "⁶ Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest\
      \ perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. \n"
    8: "⁸ Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. \n"
    9: "⁹ For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether\
      \ ye be obedient in all things. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing,\
      \ to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his\
      \ devices. \n"
    12: "¹² Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door\
      \ was opened unto me of the Lord, \n"
    13: "¹³ I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but\
      \ taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ,\
      \ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved,\
      \ and in them that perish: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the\
      \ savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? \n"
    17: '¹⁷ For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity,
      but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.'
  3:
    1: "¹ Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles\
      \ of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? \n"
    2: "² Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: \n"
    3: "³ Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered\
      \ by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in\
      \ tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. \n"
    4: "⁴ And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: \n"
    5: "⁵ Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves;\
      \ but our sufficiency is of God; \n"
    6: "⁶ Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter,\
      \ but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. \n"
    7: "⁷ But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious,\
      \ so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses\
      \ for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: \n"
    8: "⁸ How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? \n"
    9: "⁹ For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration\
      \ of righteousness exceed in glory. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by\
      \ reason of the glory that excelleth. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth\
      \ is glorious. \n"
    12: "¹² Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of\
      \ Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail\
      \ untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away\
      \ in Christ. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there\
      \ is liberty. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
      are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of
      the Lord.
  4:
    1: "¹ Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint\
      \ not; \n"
    2: "² But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,\
      \ nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth\
      \ commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. \n"
    3: "³ But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: \n"
    4: "⁴ In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe\
      \ not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of\
      \ God, should shine unto them. \n"
    5: "⁵ For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your\
      \ servants for Jesus' sake. \n"
    6: "⁶ For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in\
      \ our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the\
      \ face of Jesus Christ. \n"
    7: "⁷ But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the\
      \ power may be of God, and not of us. \n"
    8: "⁸ We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but\
      \ not in despair; \n"
    9: "⁹ Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the\
      \ life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that\
      \ the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. \n"
    12: "¹² So then death worketh in us, but life in you. \n"
    13: "¹³ We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed,\
      \ and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also\
      \ by Jesus, and shall present us with you. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through\
      \ the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the\
      \ inward man is renewed day by day. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a\
      \ far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; \n"
    18: '¹⁸ While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
      are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which
      are not seen are eternal.'
  5:
    1: "¹ For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,\
      \ we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house\
      \ which is from heaven: \n"
    3: "³ If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. \n"
    4: "⁴ For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that\
      \ we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed\
      \ up of life. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath\
      \ given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. \n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in\
      \ the body, we are absent from the Lord: \n"
    7: "⁷ (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) \n"
    8: "⁸ We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body,\
      \ and to be present with the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted\
      \ of him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every\
      \ one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,\
      \ whether it be good or bad. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are\
      \ made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to\
      \ glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory\
      \ in appearance, and not in heart. \n"
    13: "¹³ For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober,\
      \ it is for your cause. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if\
      \ one died for all, then were all dead: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live\
      \ unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have\
      \ known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are\
      \ passed away; behold, all things are become new. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus\
      \ Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not\
      \ imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of\
      \ reconciliation. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you\
      \ by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. \n"
    21: ²¹ For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
      made the righteousness of God in him.
  6:
    1: "¹ We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive\
      \ not the grace of God in vain. \n"
    2: "² (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation\
      \ have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the\
      \ day of salvation.) \n"
    3: "³ Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: \n"
    4: "⁴ But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience,\
      \ in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, \n"
    5: "⁵ In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ By pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost,\
      \ by love unfeigned, \n"
    7: "⁷ By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness\
      \ on the right hand and on the left, \n"
    8: "⁸ By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and\
      \ yet true; \n"
    9: "⁹ As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened,\
      \ and not killed; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having\
      \ nothing, and yet possessing all things. \n"
    11: "¹¹ O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. \n"
    12: "¹² Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye\
      \ also enlarged. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship\
      \ hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with\
      \ darkness? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth\
      \ with an infidel? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple\
      \ of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them;\
      \ and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,\
      \ and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
      the Lord Almighty.
  7:
    1: "¹ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves\
      \ from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear\
      \ of God. \n"
    2: "² Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded\
      \ no man. \n"
    3: "³ I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in\
      \ our hearts to die and live with you. \n"
    4: "⁴ Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you:\
      \ I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. \n"
    5: "⁵ For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were\
      \ troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. \n"
    6: "⁶ Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us\
      \ by the coming of Titus; \n"
    7: "⁷ And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted\
      \ in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind\
      \ toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. \n"
    8: "⁸ For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did\
      \ repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it\
      \ were but for a season. \n"
    9: "⁹ Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance:\
      \ for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage\
      \ by us in nothing. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of:\
      \ but the sorrow of the world worketh death. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what\
      \ carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what\
      \ indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea,\
      \ what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this\
      \ matter. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had\
      \ done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for\
      \ you in the sight of God might appear unto you. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the\
      \ more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you\
      \ all. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as\
      \ we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before\
      \ Titus, is found a truth. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth\
      \ the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. \n"
    16: ¹⁶ I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
  8:
    1: "¹ Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the\
      \ churches of Macedonia; \n"
    2: "² How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their\
      \ deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. \n"
    3: "³ For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were\
      \ willing of themselves; \n"
    4: "⁴ Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon\
      \ us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. \n"
    5: "⁵ And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the\
      \ Lord, and unto us by the will of God. \n"
    6: "⁶ Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish\
      \ in you the same grace also. \n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge,\
      \ and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace\
      \ also. \n"
    8: "⁸ I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others,\
      \ and to prove the sincerity of your love. \n"
    9: "⁹ For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,\
      \ yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun\
      \ before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to\
      \ will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. \n"
    12: "¹² For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that\
      \ a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. \n"
    13: "¹³ For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply\
      \ for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that\
      \ there may be equality: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that\
      \ had gathered little had no lack. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of\
      \ Titus for you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his\
      \ own accord he went unto you. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout\
      \ all the churches; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with\
      \ us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord,\
      \ and declaration of your ready mind: \n"
    20: "²⁰ Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is\
      \ administered by us: \n"
    21: "²¹ Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also\
      \ in the sight of men. \n"
    22: "²² And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved\
      \ diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence\
      \ which I have in you. \n"
    23: "²³ Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning\
      \ you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches,\
      \ and the glory of Christ. \n"
    24: ²⁴ Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love,
      and of our boasting on your behalf.
  9:
    1: "¹ For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me\
      \ to write to you: \n"
    2: "² For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them\
      \ of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked\
      \ very many. \n"
    3: "³ Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain\
      \ in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: \n"
    4: "⁴ Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we\
      \ (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would\
      \ go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice\
      \ before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of\
      \ covetousness. \n"
    6: "⁶ But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and\
      \ he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. \n"
    7: "⁷ Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly,\
      \ or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. \n"
    8: "⁸ And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having\
      \ all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: \n"
    9: "⁹ (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor:\
      \ his righteousness remaineth for ever. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your\
      \ food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through\
      \ us thanksgiving to God. \n"
    12: "¹² For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of\
      \ the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; \n"
    13: "¹³ Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your\
      \ professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution\
      \ unto them, and unto all men; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace\
      \ of God in you. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
  10:
    1: "¹ Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ,\
      \ who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: \n"
    2: "² But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence,\
      \ wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked\
      \ according to the flesh. \n"
    3: "³ For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: \n"
    4: "⁴ (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to\
      \ the pulling down of strong holds;) \n"
    5: "⁵ Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against\
      \ the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience\
      \ of Christ; \n"
    6: "⁶ And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience\
      \ is fulfilled. \n"
    7: "⁷ Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? if any man trust to himself\
      \ that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's,\
      \ even so are we Christ's. \n"
    8: "⁸ For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord\
      \ hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not\
      \ be ashamed: \n"
    9: "⁹ That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence\
      \ is weak, and his speech contemptible. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when\
      \ we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present. \n"
    12: "¹² For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with\
      \ some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves,\
      \ and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. \n"
    13: "¹³ But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to\
      \ the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach\
      \ even unto you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached\
      \ not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel\
      \ of Christ: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours;\
      \ but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by\
      \ you according to our rule abundantly, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another\
      \ man's line of things made ready to our hand. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
  11:
    1: "¹ Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear\
      \ with me. \n"
    2: "² For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to\
      \ one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. \n"
    3: "³ But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty,\
      \ so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. \n"
    4: "⁴ For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached,\
      \ or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel,\
      \ which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. \n"
    5: "⁵ For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. \n"
    6: "⁶ But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly\
      \ made manifest among you in all things. \n"
    7: "⁷ Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted,\
      \ because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? \n"
    8: "⁸ I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. \n"
    9: "⁹ And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man:\
      \ for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied:\
      \ and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so\
      \ will I keep myself. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting\
      \ in the regions of Achaia. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. \n"
    12: "¹² But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which\
      \ desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. \n"
    13: "¹³ For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves\
      \ into the apostles of Christ. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as\
      \ the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I say again, let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive\
      \ me, that I may boast myself a little. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly,\
      \ in this confidence of boasting. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if\
      \ a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever\
      \ any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. \n"
    22: "²² Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the\
      \ seed of Abraham? so am I. \n"
    23: "²³ Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours\
      \ more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths\
      \ oft. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck,\
      \ a night and a day I have been in the deep; \n"
    26: "²⁶ In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils\
      \ by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in\
      \ perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,\
      \ in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily,\
      \ the care of all the churches. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? \n"
    30: "³⁰ If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore,\
      \ knoweth that I lie not. \n"
    32: "³² In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes\
      \ with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: \n"
    33: ³³ And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped
      his hands.
  12:
    1: "¹ It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and\
      \ revelations of the Lord. \n"
    2: "² I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I\
      \ cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such\
      \ an one caught up to the third heaven. \n"
    3: "³ And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot\
      \ tell: God knoweth;) \n"
    4: "⁴ How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which\
      \ it is not lawful for a man to utter. \n"
    5: "⁵ Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine\
      \ infirmities. \n"
    6: "⁶ For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say\
      \ the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which\
      \ he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. \n"
    7: "⁷ And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the\
      \ revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of\
      \ Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. \n"
    8: "⁸ For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is\
      \ made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my\
      \ infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities,\
      \ in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then\
      \ am I strong. \n"
    11: "¹¹ I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have\
      \ been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles,\
      \ though I be nothing. \n"
    12: "¹² Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience,\
      \ in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. \n"
    13: "¹³ For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be\
      \ that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome\
      \ to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up\
      \ for the parents, but the parents for the children. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly\
      \ I love you, the less I be loved. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught\
      \ you with guile. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain\
      \ of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God\
      \ in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and\
      \ that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates,\
      \ envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: \n"
    21: ²¹ And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that
      I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the
      uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
  13:
    1: "¹ This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three\
      \ witnesses shall every word be established. \n"
    2: "² I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time;\
      \ and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to\
      \ all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: \n"
    3: "³ Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not\
      \ weak, but is mighty in you. \n"
    4: "⁴ For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power\
      \ of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power\
      \ of God toward you. \n"
    5: "⁵ Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know\
      \ ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. \n"
    7: "⁷ Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved,\
      \ but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. \n"
    8: "⁸ For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. \n"
    9: "⁹ For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish,\
      \ even your perfection. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should\
      \ use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification,\
      \ and not to destruction. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one\
      \ mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. \n"
    12: "¹² Greet one another with an holy kiss. \n"
    13: "¹³ All the saints salute you. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion
      of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
