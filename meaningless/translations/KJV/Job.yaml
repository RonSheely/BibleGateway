Job:
  1:
    1: "¹ There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was\
      \ perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. \n"
    2: "² And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. \n"
    3: "³ His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels,\
      \ and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great\
      \ household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. \n"
    4: "⁴ And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent\
      \ and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. \n"
    5: "⁵ And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job\
      \ sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt\
      \ offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that\
      \ my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before\
      \ the Lord, and Satan came also among them. \n"
    7: "⁷ And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the\
      \ Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and\
      \ down in it. \n"
    8: "⁸ And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that\
      \ there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that\
      \ feareth God, and escheweth evil? \n"
    9: "⁹ Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about\
      \ all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and\
      \ his substance is increased in the land. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will\
      \ curse thee to thy face. \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power;\
      \ only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking\
      \ wine in their eldest brother's house: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing,\
      \ and the asses feeding beside them: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain\
      \ the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell\
      \ thee. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire\
      \ of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants,\
      \ and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans\
      \ made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away,\
      \ yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped\
      \ alone to tell thee. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons\
      \ and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's\
      \ house: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the\
      \ four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead;\
      \ and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down\
      \ upon the ground, and worshipped, \n"
    21: "²¹ And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return\
      \ thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    22: ²² In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
  2:
    1: "¹ Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before\
      \ the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered\
      \ the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up\
      \ and down in it. \n"
    3: "³ And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that\
      \ there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that\
      \ feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity,\
      \ although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. \n"
    4: "⁴ And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man\
      \ hath will he give for his life. \n"
    5: "⁵ But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will\
      \ curse thee to thy face. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his\
      \ life. \n"
    7: "⁷ So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore\
      \ boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. \n"
    8: "⁸ And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among\
      \ the ashes. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse\
      \ God, and die. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.\
      \ What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?\
      \ In all this did not Job sin with his lips. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon\
      \ him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad\
      \ the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together\
      \ to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. \n"
    12: "¹² And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted\
      \ up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled\
      \ dust upon their heads toward heaven. \n"
    13: '¹³ So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,
      and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.'
  3:
    1: "¹ After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. \n"
    2: "² And Job spake, and said, \n"
    3: "³ Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said,\
      \ There is a man child conceived. \n"
    4: "⁴ Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let\
      \ the light shine upon it. \n"
    5: "⁵ Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it;\
      \ let the blackness of the day terrify it. \n"
    6: "⁶ As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto\
      \ the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. \n"
    7: "⁷ Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. \n"
    8: "⁸ Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but\
      \ have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from\
      \ mine eyes. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came\
      \ out of the belly? \n"
    12: "¹² Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? \n"
    13: "¹³ For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept:\
      \ then had I been at rest, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for\
      \ themselves; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never\
      \ saw light. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter\
      \ in soul; \n"
    21: "²¹ Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for\
      \ hid treasures; \n"
    22: "²² Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged\
      \ in? \n"
    24: "²⁴ For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like\
      \ the waters. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I\
      \ was afraid of is come unto me. \n"
    26: ²⁶ I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble
      came.
  4:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, \n"
    2: "² If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold\
      \ himself from speaking? \n"
    3: "³ Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened\
      \ the feeble knees. \n"
    5: "⁵ But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou\
      \ art troubled. \n"
    6: "⁶ Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy\
      \ ways? \n"
    7: "⁷ Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were\
      \ the righteous cut off? \n"
    8: "⁸ Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the\
      \ same. \n"
    9: "⁹ By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they\
      \ consumed. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth\
      \ of the young lions, are broken. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are\
      \ scattered abroad. \n"
    12: "¹² Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little\
      \ thereof. \n"
    13: "¹³ In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on\
      \ men, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was\
      \ before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than\
      \ his maker? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with\
      \ folly: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is\
      \ in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? \n"
    20: "²⁰ They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without\
      \ any regarding it. \n"
    21: ²¹ Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without
      wisdom.
  5:
    1: "¹ Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints\
      \ wilt thou turn? \n"
    2: "² For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. \n"
    3: "³ I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither\
      \ is there any to deliver them. \n"
    5: "⁵ Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns,\
      \ and the robber swalloweth up their substance. \n"
    6: "⁶ Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring\
      \ out of the ground; \n"
    7: "⁷ Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. \n"
    8: "⁸ I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: \n"
    9: "⁹ Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: \n"
    11: "¹¹ To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted\
      \ to safety. \n"
    12: "¹² He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot\
      \ perform their enterprise. \n"
    13: "¹³ He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward\
      \ is carried headlong. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in\
      \ the night. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the\
      \ hand of the mighty. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou\
      \ the chastening of the Almighty: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil\
      \ touch thee. \n"
    20: "²⁰ In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of\
      \ the sword. \n"
    21: "²¹ Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be\
      \ afraid of destruction when it cometh. \n"
    22: "²² At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid\
      \ of the beasts of the earth. \n"
    23: "²³ For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts\
      \ of the field shall be at peace with thee. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt\
      \ visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring\
      \ as the grass of the earth. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh\
      \ in in his season. \n"
    27: ²⁷ Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy
      good.
  6:
    1: "¹ But Job answered and said, \n"
    2: "² Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances\
      \ together! \n"
    3: "³ For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words\
      \ are swallowed up. \n"
    4: "⁴ For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh\
      \ up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. \n"
    5: "⁵ Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste\
      \ in the white of an egg? \n"
    7: "⁷ The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. \n"
    8: "⁸ Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that\
      \ I long for! \n"
    9: "⁹ Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his\
      \ hand, and cut me off! \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow:\
      \ let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. \n"
    11: "¹¹ What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I\
      \ should prolong my life? \n"
    12: "¹² Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? \n"
    13: "¹³ Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he\
      \ forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks\
      \ they pass away; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed\
      \ out of their place. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. \n"
    20: "²⁰ They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were\
      \ ashamed. \n"
    21: "²¹ For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. \n"
    22: "²² Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the\
      \ mighty? \n"
    24: "²⁴ Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein\
      \ I have erred. \n"
    25: "²⁵ How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? \n"
    26: "²⁶ Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate,\
      \ which are as wind? \n"
    27: "²⁷ Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if\
      \ I lie. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness\
      \ is in it. \n"
    30: ³⁰ Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
  7:
    1: "¹ Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also\
      \ like the days of an hireling? \n"
    2: "² As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for\
      \ the reward of his work: \n"
    3: "³ So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed\
      \ to me. \n"
    4: "⁴ When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I\
      \ am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. \n"
    5: "⁵ My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and\
      \ become loathsome. \n"
    6: "⁶ My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. \n"
    8: "⁸ The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon\
      \ me, and I am not. \n"
    9: "⁹ As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the\
      \ grave shall come up no more. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him\
      \ any more. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of\
      \ my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. \n"
    12: "¹² Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? \n"
    13: "¹³ When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest\
      \ set thine heart upon him? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow\
      \ down my spittle? \n"
    20: "²⁰ I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why\
      \ hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?\
      \ \n"
    21: ²¹ And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity?
      for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but
      I shall not be.
  8:
    1: "¹ Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, \n"
    2: "² How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy\
      \ mouth be like a strong wind? \n"
    3: "³ Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? \n"
    4: "⁴ If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for\
      \ their transgression; \n"
    5: "⁵ If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the\
      \ Almighty; \n"
    6: "⁶ If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make\
      \ the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. \n"
    7: "⁷ Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the\
      \ search of their fathers: \n"
    9: "⁹ (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth\
      \ are a shadow:) \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their\
      \ heart? \n"
    11: "¹¹ Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? \n"
    12: "¹² Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before\
      \ any other herb. \n"
    13: "¹³ So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall\
      \ perish: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it\
      \ fast, but it shall not endure. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have\
      \ not seen thee. \n"

    11: "¹¹ Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye\

    12: "¹² Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced\
      \ Job, or that answered his words: \n"
    13: "¹³ Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down,\
      \ not man. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him\
      \ with your speeches. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered\
      \ no more;) \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like\

    21: "²¹ Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering\

    19: "¹⁹ He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his\

    27: "²⁷ He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that\

    4: "⁴ Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.\

    10: "¹⁰ Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God,\
      \ that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit\
      \ iniquity. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to\

    12: "¹² Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert\

    13: "¹³ Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole\

    14: "¹⁴ If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and\

    18: "¹⁸ Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth\

    20: "²⁰ In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight,\

    22: "²² There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity\

    23: "²³ For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into\

    24: "²⁴ He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in\

    25: "²⁵ Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night,\

    26: "²⁶ He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; \n"
    27: "²⁷ Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:\

    30: "³⁰ That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. \n"
    31: "³¹ Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will\

    37: ³⁷ For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and

  35:
    1: "¹ Elihu spake moreover, and said, \n"
    2: "² Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more\

    4: "⁴ I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. \n"
    5: "⁵ Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than\

    6: "⁶ If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be\
      \ multiplied, what doest thou unto him? \n"
    7: "⁷ If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine\

    11: "¹¹ Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser\

    12: "¹² There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him;\
      \ therefore trust thou in him. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth\
      \ it not in great extremity: \n"
    16: ¹⁶ Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without
      knowledge.
  36:
    1: "¹ Elihu also proceeded, and said, \n"
    2: "² Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's\

    3: "³ I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my\

    4: "⁴ For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is\

    5: "⁵ Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and\

    6: "⁶ He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they\
      \ on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; \n"
    9: "⁹ Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have\

    10: "¹⁰ He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return\

    14: "¹⁴ They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place,\
      \ where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should\

    17: "¹⁷ But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice\

    18: "¹⁸ Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke:\
      \ then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. \n"
    21: "²¹ Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than\

    22: "²² Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? \n"
    23: "²³ Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his\

    27: "²⁷ For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according\

    28: "²⁸ Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of\

    31: "³¹ For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. \n"
    32: "³² With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the\

    33: ³³ The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the
      vapour.
  37:
    1: "¹ At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. \n"
    2: "² Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of\
      \ his mouth. \n"
    3: "³ He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends\
      \ of the earth. \n"
    4: "⁴ After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency;\
      \ and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. \n"
    5: "⁵ God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which\
      \ we cannot comprehend. \n"
    6: "⁶ For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain,\

    12: "¹² And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever\

    24: '²⁴ Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.'
  38:

    25: "²⁵ When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings\
      \ they purify themselves. \n"
    26: "²⁶ The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart,\
      \ nor the habergeon. \n"
    27: "²⁷ He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. \n"
    28: "²⁸ The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.\

    3: "³ Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered\
      \ that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. \n"
    4: "⁴ Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare\
      \ thou unto me. \n"
    5: "⁵ I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.\

    6: "⁶ Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. \n"
    7: "⁷ And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the\
      \ Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against\
      \ thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as\
      \ my servant Job hath. \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my\
      \ servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant\
      \ Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after\
      \ your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like\
      \ my servant Job. \n"
    9: "⁹ So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite\
      \ went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted\
      \ Job. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends:\
      \ also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all\
      \ they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him\
      \ in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that\
      \ the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and\
      \ every one an earring of gold. \n"
    12: "¹² So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for\
      \ he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke\
      \ of oxen, and a thousand she asses. \n"
    13: "¹³ He had also seven sons and three daughters. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second,\
      \ Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job:\
      \ and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and\
      \ his sons' sons, even four generations. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Job died, being old and full of days.
