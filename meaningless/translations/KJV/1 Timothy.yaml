1 Timothy:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour,\
      \ and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; \n"
    2: "² Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God\
      \ our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. \n"
    3: "³ As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia,\
      \ that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, \n"
    4: "⁴ Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions,\
      \ rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a\
      \ good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: \n"
    6: "⁶ From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; \n"
    7: "⁷ Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say,\
      \ nor whereof they affirm. \n"
    8: "⁸ But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; \n"
    9: "⁹ Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the\
      \ lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane,\
      \ for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers,\
      \ for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary\
      \ to sound doctrine; \n"
    11: "¹¹ According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed\
      \ to my trust. \n"
    12: "¹² And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted\
      \ me faithful, putting me into the ministry; \n"
    13: "¹³ Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained\
      \ mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which\
      \ is in Christ Jesus. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ\
      \ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ\
      \ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter\
      \ believe on him to life everlasting. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be\
      \ honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies\
      \ which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning\
      \ faith have made shipwreck: \n"
    20: ²⁰ Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that
      they may learn not to blaspheme.
  2:
    1: "¹ I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,\
      \ and giving of thanks, be made for all men; \n"
    2: "² For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and\
      \ peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. \n"
    3: "³ For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; \n"
    4: "⁴ Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the\
      \ truth. \n"
    5: "⁵ For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ\
      \ Jesus; \n"
    6: "⁶ Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. \n"
    7: "⁷ Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in\
      \ Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. \n"
    8: "⁸ I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without\
      \ wrath and doubting. \n"
    9: "⁹ In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with\
      \ shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or\
      \ costly array; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. \n"
    12: "¹² But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man,\
      \ but to be in silence. \n"
    13: "¹³ For Adam was first formed, then Eve. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\
      \ \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in
      faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
  3:
    1: "¹ This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth\
      \ a good work. \n"
    2: "² A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober,\
      \ of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; \n"
    3: "³ Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient,\
      \ not a brawler, not covetous; \n"
    4: "⁴ One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with\
      \ all gravity; \n"
    5: "⁵ (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care\
      \ of the church of God?) \n"
    6: "⁶ Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation\
      \ of the devil. \n"
    7: "⁷ Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall\
      \ into reproach and the snare of the devil. \n"
    8: "⁸ Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much\
      \ wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; \n"
    9: "⁹ Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a\
      \ deacon, being found blameless. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in\
      \ all things. \n"
    12: "¹² Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and\
      \ their own houses well. \n"
    13: "¹³ For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves\
      \ a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave\
      \ thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar\
      \ and ground of the truth. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest
      in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles,
      believed on in the world, received up into glory.'
  4:
    1: "¹ Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart\
      \ from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath\
      \ created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the\
      \ truth. \n"
    4: "⁴ For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received\
      \ with thanksgiving: \n"
    5: "⁵ For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. \n"
    6: "⁶ If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a\
      \ good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good\
      \ doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. \n"
    7: "⁷ But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto\
      \ godliness. \n"
    8: "⁸ For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all\
      \ things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in\
      \ the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ These things command and teach. \n"
    12: "¹² Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers,\
      \ in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. \n"
    13: "¹³ Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy,\
      \ with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting\
      \ may appear to all. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in
      doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.'
  5:
    1: "¹ Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as\
      \ brethren; \n"
    2: "² The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. \n"
    3: "³ Honour widows that are widows indeed. \n"
    4: "⁴ But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew\
      \ piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable\
      \ before God. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth\
      \ in supplications and prayers night and day. \n"
    6: "⁶ But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. \n"
    7: "⁷ And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless. \n"
    8: "⁸ But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house,\
      \ he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. \n"
    9: "⁹ Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having\
      \ been the wife of one man. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she\
      \ have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved\
      \ the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton\
      \ against Christ, they will marry; \n"
    12: "¹² Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. \n"
    13: "¹³ And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house;\
      \ and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which\
      \ they ought not. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the\
      \ house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For some are already turned aside after Satan. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them,\
      \ and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows\
      \ indeed. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially\
      \ they who labour in the word and doctrine. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out\
      \ the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. \n"
    21: "²¹ I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels,\
      \ that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing\
      \ nothing by partiality. \n"
    22: "²² Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins:\
      \ keep thyself pure. \n"
    23: "²³ Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and\
      \ thine often infirmities. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some\
      \ men they follow after. \n"
    25: ²⁵ Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they
      that are otherwise cannot be hid.
  6:
    1: "¹ Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy\
      \ of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. \n"
    2: "² And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because\
      \ they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and\
      \ beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. \n"
    3: "³ If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the\
      \ words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to\
      \ godliness; \n"
    4: "⁴ He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of\
      \ words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, \n"
    5: "⁵ Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth,\
      \ supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. \n"
    6: "⁶ But godliness with contentment is great gain. \n"
    7: "⁷ For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing\
      \ out. \n"
    8: "⁸ And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. \n"
    9: "⁹ But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many\
      \ foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted\
      \ after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with\
      \ many sorrows. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness,\
      \ godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. \n"
    12: "¹² Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou\
      \ art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and\
      \ before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing\
      \ of our Lord Jesus Christ: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate,\
      \ the King of kings, and Lord of lords; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach\
      \ unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.\
      \ Amen. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded,\
      \ nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly\
      \ all things to enjoy; \n"
    18: "¹⁸ That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute,\
      \ willing to communicate; \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to\
      \ come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. \n"
    20: "²⁰ O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane\
      \ and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: \n"
    21: ²¹ Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee.
      Amen.
