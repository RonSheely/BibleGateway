1 Corinthians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and\
      \ Sosthenes our brother, \n"
    2: "² Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified\
      \ in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon\
      \ the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's: \n"
    3: "³ Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus\
      \ Christ. \n"
    4: "⁴ I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given\
      \ you by Jesus Christ; \n"
    5: "⁵ That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all\
      \ knowledge; \n"
    6: "⁶ Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: \n"
    7: "⁷ So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus\
      \ Christ: \n"
    8: "⁸ Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the\
      \ day of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    9: "⁹ God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus\
      \ Christ our Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that\
      \ ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but\
      \ that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are\
      \ of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. \n"
    12: "¹² Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos;\
      \ and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. \n"
    13: "¹³ Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in\
      \ the name of Paul? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether\
      \ I baptized any other. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with\
      \ wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but\
      \ unto us which are saved it is the power of God. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring\
      \ to nothing the understanding of the prudent. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this\
      \ world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? \n"
    21: "²¹ For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,\
      \ it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: \n"
    23: "²³ But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto\
      \ the Greeks foolishness; \n"
    24: "²⁴ But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power\
      \ of God, and the wisdom of God. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of\
      \ God is stronger than men. \n"
    26: "²⁶ For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the\
      \ flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: \n"
    27: "²⁷ But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;\
      \ and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which\
      \ are mighty; \n"
    28: "²⁸ And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God\
      \ chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ That no flesh should glory in his presence. \n"
    30: "³⁰ But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,\
      \ and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: \n"
    31: ³¹ That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
      Lord.
  2:
    1: "¹ And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech\
      \ or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. \n"
    2: "² For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and\
      \ him crucified. \n"
    3: "³ And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. \n"
    4: "⁴ And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,\
      \ but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: \n"
    5: "⁵ That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power\
      \ of God. \n"
    6: "⁶ Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom\
      \ of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: \n"
    7: "⁷ But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which\
      \ God ordained before the world unto our glory: \n"
    8: "⁸ Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they\
      \ would not have crucified the Lord of glory. \n"
    9: "⁹ But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered\
      \ into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love\
      \ him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth\
      \ all things, yea, the deep things of God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which\
      \ is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which\
      \ is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth,\
      \ but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for\
      \ they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are\
      \ spiritually discerned. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged\
      \ of no man. \n"
    16: ¹⁶ For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but
      we have the mind of Christ.
  3:
    1: "¹ And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto\
      \ carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. \n"
    2: "² I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able\
      \ to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. \n"
    3: "³ For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife,\
      \ and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? \n"
    4: "⁴ For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye\
      \ not carnal? \n"
    5: "⁵ Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed,\
      \ even as the Lord gave to every man? \n"
    6: "⁶ I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. \n"
    7: "⁷ So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth;\
      \ but God that giveth the increase. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive\
      \ his own reward according to his own labour. \n"
    9: "⁹ For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's\
      \ building. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder,\
      \ I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man\
      \ take heed how he buildeth thereupon. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus\
      \ Christ. \n"
    12: "¹² Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones,\
      \ wood, hay, stubble; \n"
    13: "¹³ Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,\
      \ because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work\
      \ of what sort it is. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive\
      \ a reward. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself\
      \ shall be saved; yet so as by fire. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God\
      \ dwelleth in you? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple\
      \ of God is holy, which temple ye are. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in\
      \ this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,\
      \ He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's; \n"
    22: "²² Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death,\
      \ or things present, or things to come; all are your's; \n"
    23: ²³ And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
  4:
    1: "¹ Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards\
      \ of the mysteries of God. \n"
    2: "² Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. \n"
    3: "³ But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or\
      \ of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. \n"
    4: "⁴ For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that\
      \ judgeth me is the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will\
      \ bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels\
      \ of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. \n"
    6: "⁶ And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and\
      \ to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above\
      \ that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou\
      \ didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if\
      \ thou hadst not received it? \n"
    8: "⁸ Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and\
      \ I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. \n"
    9: "⁹ For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed\
      \ to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to\
      \ men. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak,\
      \ but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked,\
      \ and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; \n"
    12: "¹² And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being\
      \ persecuted, we suffer it: \n"
    13: "¹³ Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and\
      \ are the offscouring of all things unto this day. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not\
      \ many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son,\
      \ and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways\
      \ which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the\
      \ speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. \n"
    21: ²¹ What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the
      spirit of meekness?
  5:
    1: "¹ It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication\
      \ as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's\
      \ wife. \n"
    2: "² And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done\
      \ this deed might be taken away from among you. \n"
    3: "³ For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already,\
      \ as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, \n"
    4: "⁴ In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and\
      \ my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, \n"
    5: "⁵ To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that\
      \ the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. \n"
    6: "⁶ Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the\
      \ whole lump? \n"
    7: "⁷ Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are\
      \ unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven\
      \ of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous,\
      \ or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is\
      \ called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer,\
      \ or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. \n"
    12: "¹² For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge\
      \ them that are within? \n"
    13: ¹³ But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves
      that wicked person.
  6:
    1: "¹ Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust,\
      \ and not before the saints? \n"
    2: "² Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall\
      \ be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? \n"
    3: "³ Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain\
      \ to this life? \n"
    4: "⁴ If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to\
      \ judge who are least esteemed in the church. \n"
    5: "⁵ I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?\
      \ no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? \n"
    6: "⁶ But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one\
      \ with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer\
      \ yourselves to be defrauded? \n"
    8: "⁸ Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. \n"
    9: "⁹ Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be\
      \ not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,\
      \ nor abusers of themselves with mankind, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,\
      \ shall inherit the kingdom of God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but\
      \ ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things\
      \ are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. \n"
    13: "¹³ Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both\
      \ it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the\
      \ Lord for the body. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his\
      \ own power. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take\
      \ the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for\
      \ two, saith he, shall be one flesh. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but\
      \ he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which\
      \ is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? \n"
    20: "²⁰ For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and\
      \ in your spirit, which are God's."
  7:
    1: "¹ Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man\
      \ not to touch a woman. \n"
    2: "² Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and\
      \ let every woman have her own husband. \n"
    3: "³ Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also\
      \ the wife unto the husband. \n"
    4: "⁴ The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also\
      \ the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. \n"
    5: "⁵ Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that\
      \ ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that\
      \ Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. \n"
    6: "⁶ But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. \n"
    7: "⁷ For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper\
      \ gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. \n"
    8: "⁸ I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they\
      \ abide even as I. \n"
    9: "⁹ But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than\
      \ to burn. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife\
      \ depart from her husband: \n"
    11: "¹¹ But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her\
      \ husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. \n"
    12: "¹² But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that\
      \ believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased\
      \ to dwell with her, let her not leave him. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving\
      \ wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now\
      \ are they holy. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is\
      \ not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or\
      \ how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every\
      \ one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.\
      \ Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping\
      \ of the commandments of God. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. \n"
    21: "²¹ Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be\
      \ made free, use it rather. \n"
    22: "²² For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman:\
      \ likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant. \n"
    23: "²³ Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my\
      \ judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. \n"
    26: "²⁶ I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say,\
      \ that it is good for a man so to be. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from\
      \ a wife? seek not a wife. \n"
    28: "²⁸ But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she\
      \ hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I\
      \ spare you. \n"
    29: "²⁹ But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they\
      \ that have wives be as though they had none; \n"
    30: "³⁰ And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as\
      \ though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this\
      \ world passeth away. \n"
    32: "³² But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth\
      \ for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: \n"
    33: "³³ But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how\
      \ he may please his wife. \n"
    34: "³⁴ There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman\
      \ careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in\
      \ spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she\
      \ may please her husband. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon\
      \ you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without\
      \ distraction. \n"
    36: "³⁶ But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin,\
      \ if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he\
      \ will, he sinneth not: let them marry. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity,\
      \ but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he\
      \ will keep his virgin, doeth well. \n"
    38: "³⁸ So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth\
      \ her not in marriage doeth better. \n"
    39: "³⁹ The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her\
      \ husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also
      that I have the Spirit of God.'
  8:
    1: "¹ Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge.\
      \ Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. \n"
    2: "² And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as\
      \ he ought to know. \n"
    3: "³ But if any man love God, the same is known of him. \n"
    4: "⁴ As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice\
      \ unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is\
      \ none other God but one. \n"
    5: "⁵ For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth,\
      \ (as there be gods many, and lords many,) \n"
    6: "⁶ But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and\
      \ we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience\
      \ of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their\
      \ conscience being weak is defiled. \n"
    8: "⁸ But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better;\
      \ neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. \n"
    9: "⁹ But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock\
      \ to them that are weak. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's\
      \ temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat\
      \ those things which are offered to idols; \n"
    11: "¹¹ And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ\
      \ died? \n"
    12: "¹² But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience,\
      \ ye sin against Christ. \n"
    13: ¹³ Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while
      the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
  9:
    1: "¹ Am I am not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our\
      \ Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? \n"
    2: "² If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal\
      \ of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. \n"
    3: "³ Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, \n"
    4: "⁴ Have we not power to eat and to drink? \n"
    5: "⁵ Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles,\
      \ and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? \n"
    6: "⁶ Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? \n"
    7: "⁷ Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard,\
      \ and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not\
      \ of the milk of the flock? \n"
    8: "⁸ Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? \n"
    9: "⁹ For it is written in the law of Moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of\
      \ the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this\
      \ is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth\
      \ in hope should be partaker of his hope. \n"
    11: "¹¹ If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall\
      \ reap your carnal things? \n"
    12: "¹² If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless\
      \ we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder\
      \ the gospel of Christ. \n"
    13: "¹³ Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the\
      \ things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with\
      \ the altar? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should\
      \ live of the gospel. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things,\
      \ that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than\
      \ that any man should make my glorying void. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity\
      \ is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will,\
      \ a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make\
      \ the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto\
      \ all, that I might gain the more. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them\
      \ that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are\
      \ under the law; \n"
    21: "²¹ To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to\
      \ God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without\
      \ law. \n"
    22: "²² To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all\
      \ things to all men, that I might by all means save some. \n"
    23: "²³ And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof\
      \ with you. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the\
      \ prize? So run, that ye may obtain. \n"
    25: "²⁵ And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\
      \ Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. \n"
    26: "²⁶ I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth\
      \ the air: \n"
    27: '²⁷ But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any
      means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.'
  10:
    1: "¹ Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all\
      \ our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; \n"
    2: "² And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; \n"
    3: "³ And did all eat the same spiritual meat; \n"
    4: "⁴ And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual\
      \ Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. \n"
    5: "⁵ But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown\
      \ in the wilderness. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after\
      \ evil things, as they also lusted. \n"
    7: "⁷ Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people\
      \ sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. \n"
    8: "⁸ Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in\
      \ one day three and twenty thousand. \n"
    9: "⁹ Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed\
      \ of serpents. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of\
      \ the destroyer. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written\
      \ for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. \n"
    13: "¹³ There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God\
      \ is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able;\
      \ but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able\
      \ to bear it. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood\
      \ of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of\
      \ Christ? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers\
      \ of that one bread. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices\
      \ partakers of the altar? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered\
      \ in sacrifice to idols is any thing? \n"
    20: "²⁰ But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice\
      \ to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship\
      \ with devils. \n"
    21: "²¹ Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot\
      \ be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. \n"
    22: "²² Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? \n"
    23: "²³ All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things\
      \ are lawful for me, but all things edify not. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience\
      \ sake: \n"
    26: "²⁶ For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. \n"
    27: "²⁷ If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed\
      \ to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience\
      \ sake. \n"
    28: "²⁸ But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols,\
      \ eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth\
      \ is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof: \n"
    29: "²⁹ Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty\
      \ judged of another man's conscience? \n"
    30: "³⁰ For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for\
      \ which I give thanks? \n"
    31: "³¹ Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the\
      \ glory of God. \n"
    32: "³² Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the\
      \ church of God: \n"
    33: ³³ Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but
      the profit of many, that they may be saved.
  11:
    1: "¹ Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. \n"
    2: "² Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep\
      \ the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. \n"
    3: "³ But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the\
      \ head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. \n"
    4: "⁴ Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth\
      \ his head. \n"
    5: "⁵ But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth\
      \ her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. \n"
    6: "⁶ For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame\
      \ for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. \n"
    7: "⁷ For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image\
      \ and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. \n"
    8: "⁸ For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. \n"
    9: "⁹ Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the\
      \ angels. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without\
      \ the man, in the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman;\
      \ but all things of God. \n"
    13: "¹³ Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair,\
      \ it is a shame unto him? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given\
      \ her for a covering. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither\
      \ the churches of God. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together\
      \ not for the better, but for the worse. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there\
      \ be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved\
      \ may be made manifest among you. \n"
    20: "²⁰ When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the\
      \ Lord's supper. \n"
    21: "²¹ For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is\
      \ hungry, and another is drunken. \n"
    22: "²² What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church\
      \ of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise\
      \ you in this? I praise you not. \n"
    23: "²³ For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you,\
      \ that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: \n"
    24: "²⁴ And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is\
      \ my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. \n"
    25: "²⁵ After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,\
      \ this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink\
      \ it, in remembrance of me. \n"
    26: "²⁶ For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the\
      \ Lord's death till he come. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord,\
      \ unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. \n"
    28: "²⁸ But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink\
      \ of that cup. \n"
    29: "²⁹ For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation\
      \ to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. \n"
    30: "³⁰ For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. \n"
    31: "³¹ For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. \n"
    32: "³² But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not\
      \ be condemned with the world. \n"
    33: "³³ Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.\
      \ \n"
    34: ³⁴ And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto
      condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
  12:
    1: "¹ Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even\
      \ as ye were led. \n"
    3: "³ Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of\
      \ God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord,\
      \ but by the Holy Ghost. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. \n"
    5: "⁵ And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh\
      \ all in all. \n"
    7: "⁷ But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word\
      \ of knowledge by the same Spirit; \n"
    9: "⁹ To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by\
      \ the same Spirit; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning\
      \ of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation\
      \ of tongues: \n"
    11: "¹¹ But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every\
      \ man severally as he will. \n"
    12: "¹² For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of\
      \ that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. \n"
    13: "¹³ For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews\
      \ or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into\
      \ one Spirit. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the body is not one member, but many. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body;\
      \ is it therefore not of the body? \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body;\
      \ is it therefore not of the body? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were\
      \ hearing, where were the smelling? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it\
      \ hath pleased him. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And if they were all one member, where were the body? \n"
    20: "²⁰ But now are they many members, yet but one body. \n"
    21: "²¹ And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again\
      \ the head to the feet, I have no need of you. \n"
    22: "²² Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble,\
      \ are necessary: \n"
    23: "²³ And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon\
      \ these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant\
      \ comeliness. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together,\
      \ having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked. \n"
    25: "²⁵ That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should\
      \ have the same care one for another. \n"
    26: "²⁶ And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one\
      \ member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets,\
      \ thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments,\
      \ diversities of tongues. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers\
      \ of miracles? \n"
    30: "³⁰ Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent
      way.'
  13:
    1: "¹ Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity,\
      \ I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. \n"
    2: "² And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and\
      \ all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains,\
      \ and have not charity, I am nothing. \n"
    3: "³ And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my\
      \ body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. \n"
    4: "⁴ Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth\
      \ not itself, is not puffed up, \n"
    5: "⁵ Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,\
      \ thinketh no evil; \n"
    6: "⁶ Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; \n"
    7: "⁷ Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all\
      \ things. \n"
    8: "⁸ Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail;\
      \ whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it\
      \ shall vanish away. \n"
    9: "⁹ For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall\
      \ be done away. \n"
    11: "¹¹ When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought\
      \ as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. \n"
    12: "¹² For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know\
      \ in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. \n"
    13: ¹³ And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of
      these is charity.
  14:
    1: "¹ Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may\
      \ prophesy. \n"
    2: "² For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto\
      \ God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation,\
      \ and comfort. \n"
    4: "⁴ He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth\
      \ edifieth the church. \n"
    5: "⁵ I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for\
      \ greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except\
      \ he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit\
      \ you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or\
      \ by prophesying, or by doctrine? \n"
    7: "⁷ And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except\
      \ they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped\
      \ or harped? \n"
    8: "⁸ For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to\
      \ the battle? \n"
    9: "⁹ So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood,\
      \ how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of\
      \ them is without signification. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him\
      \ that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto\
      \ me. \n"
    12: "¹² Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that\
      \ ye may excel to the edifying of the church. \n"
    13: "¹³ Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may\
      \ interpret. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding\
      \ is unfruitful. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the\
      \ understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the\
      \ understanding also. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth\
      \ the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth\
      \ not what thou sayest? \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding,\
      \ that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an\
      \ unknown tongue. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children,\
      \ but in understanding be men. \n"
    21: "²¹ In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will\
      \ I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    22: "²² Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them\
      \ that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but\
      \ for them which believe. \n"
    23: "²³ If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all\
      \ speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers,\
      \ will they not say that ye are mad? \n"
    24: "²⁴ But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one\
      \ unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: \n"
    25: "²⁵ And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down\
      \ on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath\
      \ a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.\
      \ Let all things be done unto edifying. \n"
    27: "²⁷ If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most\
      \ by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. \n"
    28: "²⁸ But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and\
      \ let him speak to himself, and to God. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. \n"
    30: "³⁰ If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold\
      \ his peace. \n"
    31: "³¹ For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be\
      \ comforted. \n"
    32: "³² And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. \n"
    33: "³³ For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches\
      \ of the saints. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto\
      \ them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith\
      \ the law. \n"
    35: "³⁵ And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home:\
      \ for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. \n"
    36: "³⁶ What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? \n"
    37: "³⁷ If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge\
      \ that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. \n"
    38: "³⁸ But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. \n"
    39: "³⁹ Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.\
      \ \n"
    40: ⁴⁰ Let all things be done decently and in order.
  15:
    1: "¹ Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto\
      \ you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; \n"
    2: "² By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you,\
      \ unless ye have believed in vain. \n"
    3: "³ For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that\
      \ Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; \n"
    4: "⁴ And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to\
      \ the scriptures: \n"
    5: "⁵ And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: \n"
    6: "⁶ After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom\
      \ the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. \n"
    7: "⁷ After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. \n"
    8: "⁸ And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle,\
      \ because I persecuted the church of God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed\
      \ upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet\
      \ not I, but the grace of God which was with me. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among\
      \ you that there is no resurrection of the dead? \n"
    13: "¹³ But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith\
      \ is also vain. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified\
      \ of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the\
      \ dead rise not. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them\
      \ that slept. \n"
    21: "²¹ For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the\
      \ dead. \n"
    22: "²² For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. \n"
    23: "²³ But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they\
      \ that are Christ's at his coming. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,\
      \ even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and\
      \ power. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. \n"
    26: "²⁶ The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. \n"
    27: "²⁷ For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things\
      \ are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things\
      \ under him. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also\
      \ himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be\
      \ all in all. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise\
      \ not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? \n"
    30: "³⁰ And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? \n"
    31: "³¹ I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die\
      \ daily. \n"
    32: "³² If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what\
      \ advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow\
      \ we die. \n"
    33: "³³ Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of\
      \ God: I speak this to your shame. \n"
    35: "³⁵ But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body\
      \ do they come? \n"
    36: "³⁶ Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: \n"
    37: "³⁷ And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but\
      \ bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: \n"
    38: "³⁸ But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his\
      \ own body. \n"
    39: "³⁹ All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men,\
      \ another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory\
      \ of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another\
      \ glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. \n"
    42: "⁴² So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it\
      \ is raised in incorruption: \n"
    43: "⁴³ It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness;\
      \ it is raised in power: \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural\
      \ body, and there is a spiritual body. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last\
      \ Adam was made a quickening spirit. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural;\
      \ and afterward that which is spiritual. \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from\
      \ heaven. \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly,\
      \ such are they also that are heavenly. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image\
      \ of the heavenly. \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom\
      \ of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. \n"
    51: "⁵¹ Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all\
      \ be changed, \n"
    52: "⁵² In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet\
      \ shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\
      \ \n"
    53: "⁵³ For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put\
      \ on immortality. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal\
      \ shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that\
      \ is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus\
      \ Christ. \n"
    58: ⁵⁸ Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding
      in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain
      in the Lord.
  16:
    1: "¹ Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the\
      \ churches of Galatia, even so do ye. \n"
    2: "² Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store,\
      \ as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. \n"
    3: "³ And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will\
      \ I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. \n"
    4: "⁴ And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. \n"
    5: "⁵ Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do\
      \ pass through Macedonia. \n"
    6: "⁶ And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring\
      \ me on my journey whithersoever I go. \n"
    7: "⁷ For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with\
      \ you, if the Lord permit. \n"
    8: "⁸ But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. \n"
    9: "⁹ For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he\
      \ worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that\
      \ he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. \n"
    12: "¹² As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you\
      \ with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he\
      \ will come when he shall have convenient time. \n"
    13: "¹³ Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Let all your things be done with charity. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the\
      \ firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry\
      \ of the saints,) \n"
    16: "¹⁶ That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with\
      \ us, and laboureth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for\
      \ that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye\
      \ them that are such. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much\
      \ in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. \n"
    20: "²⁰ All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. \n"
    21: "²¹ The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. \n"
    22: "²² If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. \n"
    24: ²⁴ My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
