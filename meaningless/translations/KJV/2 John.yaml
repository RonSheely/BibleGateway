2 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth;\
      \ and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; \n"
    2: "² For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord\
      \ Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. \n"
    4: "⁴ I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we\
      \ have received a commandment from the Father. \n"
    5: "⁵ And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto\
      \ thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment,\
      \ That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. \n"
    7: "⁷ For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus\
      \ Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. \n"
    8: "⁸ Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought,\
      \ but that we receive a full reward. \n"
    9: "⁹ Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath\
      \ not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father\
      \ and the Son. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not\
      \ into your house, neither bid him God speed: \n"
    11: "¹¹ For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \n"
    12: "¹² Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and\
      \ ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may\
      \ be full. \n"
    13: ¹³ The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
