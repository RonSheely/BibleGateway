2 Timothy:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise\
      \ of life which is in Christ Jesus, \n"
    2: "² To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the\
      \ Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. \n"
    3: "³ I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that\
      \ without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; \n"
    4: "⁴ Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be\
      \ filled with joy; \n"
    5: "⁵ When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt\
      \ first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that\
      \ in thee also. \n"
    6: "⁶ Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which\
      \ is in thee by the putting on of my hands. \n"
    7: "⁷ For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love,\
      \ and of a sound mind. \n"
    8: "⁸ Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his\
      \ prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according\
      \ to the power of God; \n"
    9: "⁹ Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to\
      \ our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us\
      \ in Christ Jesus before the world began, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ,\
      \ who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through\
      \ the gospel: \n"
    11: "¹¹ Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of\
      \ the Gentiles. \n"
    12: "¹² For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not\
      \ ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able\
      \ to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. \n"
    13: "¹³ Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith\
      \ and love which is in Christ Jesus. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which\
      \ dwelleth in us. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from\
      \ me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed\
      \ me, and was not ashamed of my chain: \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found\
      \ me. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day:
      and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.'
  2:
    1: "¹ Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same\
      \ commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. \n"
    3: "³ Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: "⁴ No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that\
      \ he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. \n"
    5: "⁵ And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he\
      \ strive lawfully. \n"
    6: "⁶ The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. \n"
    7: "⁷ Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead\
      \ according to my gospel: \n"
    9: "⁹ Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word\
      \ of God is not bound. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also\
      \ obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. \n"
    11: "¹¹ It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live\
      \ with him: \n"
    12: "¹² If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will\
      \ deny us: \n"
    13: "¹³ If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord\
      \ that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the\
      \ hearers. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to\
      \ be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more\
      \ ungodliness. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past\
      \ already; and overthrow the faith of some. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The\
      \ Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of\
      \ Christ depart from iniquity. \n"
    20: "²⁰ But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver,\
      \ but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto\
      \ honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every\
      \ good work. \n"
    22: "²² Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace,\
      \ with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. \n"
    23: "²³ But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender\
      \ strifes. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men,\
      \ apt to teach, patient, \n"
    25: "²⁵ In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure\
      \ will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; \n"
    26: ²⁶ And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who
      are taken captive by him at his will.
  3:
    1: "¹ This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. \n"
    2: "² For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,\
      \ blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, \n"
    3: "³ Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,\
      \ despisers of those that are good, \n"
    4: "⁴ Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn\
      \ away. \n"
    6: "⁶ For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly\
      \ women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, \n"
    7: "⁷ Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth:\
      \ men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. \n"
    9: "⁹ But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto\
      \ all men, as their's also was. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith,\
      \ longsuffering, charity, patience, \n"
    11: "¹¹ Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium,\
      \ at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered\
      \ me. \n"
    12: "¹² Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being\
      \ deceived. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been\
      \ assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able\
      \ to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,\
      \ for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: \n"
    17: ¹⁷ That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
      works.
  4:
    1: "¹ I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall\
      \ judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; \n"
    2: "² Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort\
      \ with all long suffering and doctrine. \n"
    3: "³ For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after\
      \ their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned\
      \ unto fables. \n"
    5: "⁵ But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist,\
      \ make full proof of thy ministry. \n"
    6: "⁶ For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,\
      \ the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto\
      \ all them also that love his appearing. \n"
    9: "⁹ Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed\
      \ unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable\
      \ to me for the ministry. \n"
    12: "¹² And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. \n"
    13: "¹³ The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with\
      \ thee, and the books, but especially the parchments. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according\
      \ to his works: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray\
      \ God that it may not be laid to their charge. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me\
      \ the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear:\
      \ and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve\
      \ me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. \n"

      \ and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. \n"
    22: ²² The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
