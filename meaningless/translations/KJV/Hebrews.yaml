Hebrews:
  1:
    1: "¹ God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the\
      \ fathers by the prophets, \n"
    2: "² Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed\
      \ heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; \n"
    3: "³ Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person,\
      \ and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself\
      \ purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: \n"
    4: "⁴ Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained\
      \ a more excellent name than they. \n"
    5: "⁵ For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this\
      \ day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall\
      \ be to me a Son? \n"
    6: "⁶ And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith,\
      \ And let all the angels of God worship him. \n"
    7: "⁷ And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers\
      \ a flame of fire. \n"
    8: "⁸ But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre\
      \ of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy\
      \ God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth;\
      \ and the heavens are the works of thine hands: \n"
    11: "¹¹ They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth\
      \ a garment; \n"
    12: "¹² And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but\
      \ thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. \n"
    13: "¹³ But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand,\
      \ until I make thine enemies thy footstool? \n"
    14: ¹⁴ Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who
      shall be heirs of salvation?
  2:
    1: "¹ Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we\
      \ have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. \n"
    2: "² For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and\
      \ disobedience received a just recompence of reward; \n"
    3: "³ How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first\
      \ began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard\
      \ him; \n"
    4: "⁴ God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers\
      \ miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? \n"
    5: "⁵ For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof\
      \ we speak. \n"
    6: "⁶ But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art\
      \ mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him? \n"
    7: "⁷ Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with\
      \ glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: \n"
    8: "⁸ Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put\
      \ all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But\
      \ now we see not yet all things put under him. \n"
    9: "⁹ But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering\
      \ of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should\
      \ taste death for every man. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,\
      \ in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect\
      \ through sufferings. \n"
    11: "¹¹ For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one:\
      \ for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, \n"
    12: "¹² Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the\
      \ church will I sing praise unto thee. \n"
    13: "¹³ And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children\
      \ which God hath given me. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also\
      \ himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy\
      \ him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject\
      \ to bondage. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him\
      \ the seed of Abraham. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,\
      \ that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining\
      \ to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. \n"
    18: ¹⁸ For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
      them that are tempted.
  3:
    1: "¹ Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the\
      \ Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; \n"
    2: "² Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in\
      \ all his house. \n"
    3: "³ For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he\
      \ who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. \n"
    4: "⁴ For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is\
      \ God. \n"
    5: "⁵ And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony\
      \ of those things which were to be spoken after; \n"
    6: "⁶ But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast\
      \ the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. \n"
    7: "⁷ Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, \n"
    8: "⁸ Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation\
      \ in the wilderness: \n"
    9: "⁹ When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway\
      \ err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. \n"
    11: "¹¹ So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) \n"
    12: "¹² Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,\
      \ in departing from the living God. \n"
    13: "¹³ But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you\
      \ be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence\
      \ stedfast unto the end; \n"
    15: "¹⁵ While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,\
      \ as in the provocation. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came\
      \ out of Egypt by Moses. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had\
      \ sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to\
      \ them that believed not? \n"
    19: ¹⁹ So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
  4:
    1: "¹ Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his\
      \ rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. \n"
    2: "² For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word\
      \ preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard\
      \ it. \n"
    3: "³ For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn\
      \ in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished\
      \ from the foundation of the world. \n"
    4: "⁴ For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God\
      \ did rest the seventh day from all his works. \n"
    5: "⁵ And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. \n"
    6: "⁶ Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to\
      \ whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: \n"
    7: "⁷ Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long\
      \ a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken\
      \ of another day. \n"
    9: "⁹ There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own\
      \ works, as God did from his. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after\
      \ the same example of unbelief. \n"
    12: "¹² For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged\
      \ sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the\
      \ joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all\
      \ things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the\
      \ heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling\
      \ of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without\
      \ sin. \n"
    16: ¹⁶ Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain
      mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
  5:
    1: "¹ For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things\
      \ pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: \n"
    2: "² Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the\
      \ way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. \n"
    3: "³ And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to\
      \ offer for sins. \n"
    4: "⁴ And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God,\
      \ as was Aaron. \n"
    5: "⁵ So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that\
      \ said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. \n"
    6: "⁶ As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the\
      \ order of Melchisedec. \n"
    7: "⁷ Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications\
      \ with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death,\
      \ and was heard in that he feared; \n"
    8: "⁸ Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all\
      \ them that obey him; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye\
      \ are dull of hearing. \n"
    12: "¹² For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach\
      \ you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become\
      \ such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. \n"
    13: "¹³ For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness:\
      \ for he is a babe. \n"
    14: ¹⁴ But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who
      by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
  6:
    1: "¹ Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on\
      \ unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works,\
      \ and of faith toward God, \n"
    2: "² Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection\
      \ of the dead, and of eternal judgment. \n"
    3: "³ And this will we do, if God permit. \n"
    4: "⁴ For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted\
      \ of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, \n"
    5: "⁵ And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they\
      \ crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth\
      \ forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing;\
      \ whose end is to be burned. \n"
    9: "⁹ But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany\
      \ salvation, though we thus speak. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which\
      \ ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints,\
      \ and do minister. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the\
      \ full assurance of hope unto the end: \n"
    12: "¹² That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience\
      \ inherit the promises. \n"
    13: "¹³ For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater,\
      \ he sware by himself, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply\
      \ thee. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to\
      \ them an end of all strife. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise\
      \ the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie,\
      \ we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon\
      \ the hope set before us: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and\
      \ which entereth into that within the veil; \n"
    20: ²⁰ Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest
      for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
  7:
    1: "¹ For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met\
      \ Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; \n"
    2: "² To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation\
      \ King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of\
      \ peace; \n"
    3: "³ Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning\
      \ of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest\
      \ continually. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham\
      \ gave the tenth of the spoils. \n"
    5: "⁵ And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of\
      \ the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according\
      \ to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins\
      \ of Abraham: \n"
    6: "⁶ But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham,\
      \ and blessed him that had the promises. \n"
    7: "⁷ And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. \n"
    8: "⁸ And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom\
      \ it is witnessed that he liveth. \n"
    9: "⁹ And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. \n"
    11: "¹¹ If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it\
      \ the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest\
      \ should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order\
      \ of Aaron? \n"
    12: "¹² For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change\
      \ also of the law. \n"
    13: "¹³ For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of\
      \ which no man gave attendance at the altar. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses\
      \ spake nothing concerning priesthood. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec\
      \ there ariseth another priest, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the\
      \ power of an endless life. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for\
      \ the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope\
      \ did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. \n"
    20: "²⁰ And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: \n"
    21: "²¹ (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by\
      \ him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest\
      \ for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) \n"
    22: "²² By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. \n"
    23: "²³ And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue\
      \ by reason of death: \n"
    24: "²⁴ But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto\
      \ God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. \n"
    26: "²⁶ For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate\
      \ from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; \n"
    27: "²⁷ Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first\
      \ for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he\
      \ offered up himself. \n"
    28: ²⁸ For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word
      of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for
      evermore.
  8:
    1: "¹ Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an\
      \ high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in\
      \ the heavens; \n"
    2: "² A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord\
      \ pitched, and not man. \n"
    3: "³ For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore\
      \ it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. \n"
    4: "⁴ For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are\
      \ priests that offer gifts according to the law: \n"
    5: "⁵ Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished\
      \ of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that\
      \ thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he\
      \ is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have\
      \ been sought for the second. \n"
    8: "⁸ For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the\
      \ Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the\
      \ house of Judah: \n"
    9: "⁹ Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day\
      \ when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because\
      \ they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after\
      \ those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write\
      \ them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me\
      \ a people: \n"
    11: "¹¹ And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,\
      \ saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their\
      \ iniquities will I remember no more. \n"
    13: ¹³ In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that
      which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
  9:
    1: "¹ Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and\
      \ a worldly sanctuary. \n"
    2: "² For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick,\
      \ and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. \n"
    3: "³ And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of\
      \ all; \n"
    4: "⁴ Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round\
      \ about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod\
      \ that budded, and the tables of the covenant; \n"
    5: "⁵ And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we\
      \ cannot now speak particularly. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the\
      \ first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. \n"
    7: "⁷ But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without\
      \ blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: \n"
    8: "⁸ The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was\
      \ not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: \n"
    9: "⁹ Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both\
      \ gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect,\
      \ as pertaining to the conscience; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal\
      \ ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater\
      \ and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this\
      \ building; \n"
    12: "¹² Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered\
      \ in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. \n"
    13: "¹³ For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling\
      \ the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: \n"
    14: "¹⁴ How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit\
      \ offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works\
      \ to serve the living God? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means\
      \ of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first\
      \ testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of\
      \ the testator. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no\
      \ strength at all while the testator liveth. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to\
      \ the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet\
      \ wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, \n"
    20: "²⁰ Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto\
      \ you. \n"
    21: "²¹ Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels\
      \ of the ministry. \n"
    22: "²² And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding\
      \ of blood is no remission. \n"
    23: "²³ It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens\
      \ should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better\
      \ sacrifices than these. \n"
    24: "²⁴ For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which\
      \ are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the\
      \ presence of God for us: \n"
    25: "²⁵ Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth\
      \ into the holy place every year with blood of others; \n"
    26: "²⁶ For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world:\
      \ but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the\
      \ sacrifice of himself. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:\
      \ \n"
    28: ²⁸ So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that
      look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
  10:
    1: "¹ For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image\
      \ of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by\
      \ year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. \n"
    2: "² For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers\
      \ once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. \n"
    3: "³ But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every\
      \ year. \n"
    4: "⁴ For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take\
      \ away sins. \n"
    5: "⁵ Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering\
      \ thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: \n"
    6: "⁶ In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,)\
      \ to do thy will, O God. \n"
    8: "⁸ Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering\
      \ for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered\
      \ by the law; \n"
    9: "⁹ Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first,\
      \ that he may establish the second. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of\
      \ Jesus Christ once for all. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the\
      \ same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: \n"
    12: "¹² But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat\
      \ down on the right hand of God; \n"
    13: "¹³ From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had\
      \ said before, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith\
      \ the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I\
      \ write them; \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the\
      \ blood of Jesus, \n"
    20: "²⁰ By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the\
      \ veil, that is to say, his flesh; \n"
    21: "²¹ And having an high priest over the house of God; \n"
    22: "²² Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having\
      \ our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure\
      \ water. \n"
    23: "²³ Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he\
      \ is faithful that promised;) \n"
    24: "²⁴ And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some\
      \ is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the\
      \ truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, \n"
    27: "²⁷ But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which\
      \ shall devour the adversaries. \n"
    28: "²⁸ He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy,\
      \ who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of\
      \ the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done\
      \ despite unto the Spirit of grace? \n"
    30: "³⁰ For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense,\
      \ saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. \n"
    31: "³¹ It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. \n"
    32: "³² But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated,\
      \ ye endured a great fight of afflictions; \n"
    33: "³³ Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions;\
      \ and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. \n"
    34: "³⁴ For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling\
      \ of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an\
      \ enduring substance. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of\
      \ reward. \n"
    36: "³⁶ For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God,\
      \ ye might receive the promise. \n"
    37: "³⁷ For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not\
      \ tarry. \n"
    38: "³⁸ Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall\
      \ have no pleasure in him. \n"
    39: ³⁹ But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe
      to the saving of the soul.
  11:
    1: "¹ Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not\
      \ seen. \n"
    2: "² For by it the elders obtained a good report. \n"
    3: "³ Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,\
      \ so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. \n"
    4: "⁴ By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by\
      \ which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts:\
      \ and by it he being dead yet speaketh. \n"
    5: "⁵ By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not\
      \ found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this\
      \ testimony, that he pleased God. \n"
    6: "⁶ But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to\
      \ God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently\
      \ seek him. \n"
    7: "⁷ By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with\
      \ fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned\
      \ the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. \n"
    8: "⁸ By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should\
      \ after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither\
      \ he went. \n"
    9: "⁹ By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling\
      \ in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker\
      \ is God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and\
      \ was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful\
      \ who had promised. \n"
    12: "¹² Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as\
      \ the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore\
      \ innumerable. \n"
    13: "¹³ These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having\
      \ seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed\
      \ that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came\
      \ out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore\
      \ God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a\
      \ city. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had\
      \ received the promises offered up his only begotten son, \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from\
      \ whence also he received him in a figure. \n"
    20: "²⁰ By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. \n"
    21: "²¹ By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph;\
      \ and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. \n"
    22: "²² By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children\
      \ of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. \n"
    23: "²³ By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents,\
      \ because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's\
      \ commandment. \n"
    24: "²⁴ By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son\
      \ of Pharaoh's daughter; \n"
    25: "²⁵ Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy\
      \ the pleasures of sin for a season; \n"
    26: "²⁶ Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in\
      \ Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. \n"
    27: "²⁷ By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured,\
      \ as seeing him who is invisible. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest\
      \ he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. \n"
    29: "²⁹ By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians\
      \ assaying to do were drowned. \n"
    30: "³⁰ By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about\
      \ seven days. \n"
    31: "³¹ By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when\
      \ she had received the spies with peace. \n"
    32: "³² And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon,\
      \ and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and\
      \ of the prophets: \n"
    33: "³³ Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises,\
      \ stopped the mouths of lions. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness\
      \ were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the\
      \ aliens. \n"
    35: "³⁵ Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured,\
      \ not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: \n"
    36: "³⁶ And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of\
      \ bonds and imprisonment: \n"
    37: "³⁷ They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with\
      \ the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute,\
      \ afflicted, tormented; \n"
    38: "³⁸ (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains,\
      \ and in dens and caves of the earth. \n"
    39: "³⁹ And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not\
      \ the promise: \n"
    40: ⁴⁰ God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should
      not be made perfect.
  12:
    1: "¹ Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,\
      \ let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us,\
      \ and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, \n"
    2: "² Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy\
      \ that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set\
      \ down at the right hand of the throne of God. \n"
    3: "³ For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself,\
      \ lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. \n"
    4: "⁴ Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. \n"
    5: "⁵ And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children,\
      \ My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art\
      \ rebuked of him: \n"
    6: "⁶ For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he\
      \ receiveth. \n"
    7: "⁷ If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son\
      \ is he whom the father chasteneth not? \n"
    8: "⁸ But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye\
      \ bastards, and not sons. \n"
    9: "⁹ Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we\
      \ gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father\
      \ of spirits, and live? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure;\
      \ but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:\
      \ nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto\
      \ them which are exercised thereby. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; \n"
    13: "¹³ And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned\
      \ out of the way; but let it rather be healed. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see\
      \ the Lord: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root\
      \ of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one\
      \ morsel of meat sold his birthright. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing,\
      \ he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it\
      \ carefully with tears. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned\
      \ with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that\
      \ heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: \n"
    20: "²⁰ (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as\
      \ a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and\
      \ quake:) \n"
    22: "²² But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God,\
      \ the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, \n"
    23: "²³ To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written\
      \ in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made\
      \ perfect, \n"
    24: "²⁴ And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling,\
      \ that speaketh better things than that of Abel. \n"
    25: "²⁵ See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who\
      \ refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn\
      \ away from him that speaketh from heaven: \n"
    26: "²⁶ Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet\
      \ once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. \n"
    27: "²⁷ And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things\
      \ that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot\
      \ be shaken may remain. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace,\
      \ whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: \n"
    29: ²⁹ For our God is a consuming fire.
  13:
    1: "¹ Let brotherly love continue. \n"
    2: "² Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained\
      \ angels unawares. \n"
    3: "³ Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer\
      \ adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. \n"
    4: "⁴ Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and\
      \ adulterers God will judge. \n"
    5: "⁵ Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such\
      \ things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake\
      \ thee. \n"
    6: "⁶ So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what\
      \ man shall do unto me. \n"
    7: "⁷ Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the\

      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. \n"
    9: "⁹ Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good\
      \ thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have\
      \ not profited them that have been occupied therein. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary\
      \ by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood,\
      \ suffered without the gate. \n"
    13: "¹³ Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,\
      \ that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices\
      \ God is well pleased. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they\
      \ watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it\
      \ with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing\
      \ to live honestly. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you\
      \ the sooner. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,\
      \ that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that\

      \ for ever and ever. Amen. \n"
    22: "²² And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have\
      \ written a letter unto you in few words. \n"
    23: "²³ Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come\
      \ shortly, I will see you. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They\

    25: ²⁵ Grace be with you all. Amen.
