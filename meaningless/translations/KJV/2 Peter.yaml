2 Peter:
  1:
    1: "¹ Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have\
      \ obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and\
      \ our Saviour Jesus Christ: \n"
    2: "² Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and\
      \ of Jesus our Lord, \n"
    3: "³ According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain\
      \ unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us\
      \ to glory and virtue: \n"
    4: "⁴ Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by\
      \ these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption\
      \ that is in the world through lust. \n"
    5: "⁵ And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to\
      \ virtue knowledge; \n"
    6: "⁶ And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience\
      \ godliness; \n"
    7: "⁷ And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither\
      \ be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    9: "⁹ But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and\
      \ hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and\
      \ election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: \n"
    11: "¹¹ For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting\
      \ kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. \n"
    12: "¹² Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of\
      \ these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you\
      \ up by putting you in remembrance; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord\
      \ Jesus Christ hath shewed me. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have\
      \ these things always in remembrance. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known\
      \ unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses\
      \ of his majesty. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came\
      \ such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom\
      \ I am well pleased. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him\
      \ in the holy mount. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye\
      \ take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn,\
      \ and the day star arise in your hearts: \n"
    20: "²⁰ Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private\
      \ interpretation. \n"
    21: '²¹ For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men
      of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.'
  2:
    1: "¹ But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall\
      \ be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies,\
      \ even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of\
      \ truth shall be evil spoken of. \n"
    3: "³ And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise\
      \ of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation\
      \ slumbereth not. \n"
    4: "⁴ For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell,\
      \ and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher\
      \ of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; \n"
    6: "⁶ And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with\
      \ an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed\
      \ his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve\
      \ the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,\
      \ and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid\
      \ to speak evil of dignities. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing\
      \ accusation against them before the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak\
      \ evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their\
      \ own corruption; \n"
    13: "¹³ And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it\
      \ pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves\
      \ with their own deceivings while they feast with you; \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling\
      \ unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed\
      \ children: \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the\
      \ way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice\
      \ forbad the madness of the prophet. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest;\
      \ to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through\
      \ the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped\
      \ from them who live in error. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption:\
      \ for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the\
      \ knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein,\
      \ and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. \n"
    21: "²¹ For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness,\
      \ than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered\
      \ unto them. \n"
    22: ²² But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is
      turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing
      in the mire.
  3:
    1: "¹ This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir\
      \ up your pure minds by way of remembrance: \n"
    2: "² That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy\
      \ prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking\
      \ after their own lusts, \n"
    4: "⁴ And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell\
      \ asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens\
      \ were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: \n"
    6: "⁶ Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept\
      \ in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of\
      \ ungodly men. \n"
    8: "⁸ But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the\
      \ Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness;\
      \ but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that\
      \ all should come to repentance. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which\
      \ the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt\
      \ with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be\
      \ burned up. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons\
      \ ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, \n"
    12: "¹² Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the\
      \ heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with\
      \ fervent heat? \n"
    13: "¹³ Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a\
      \ new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that\
      \ ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our\
      \ beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written\
      \ unto you; \n"
    16: "¹⁶ As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which\
      \ are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable\
      \ wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest\
      \ ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.\
      \ \n"
    18: ¹⁸ But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
      To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
