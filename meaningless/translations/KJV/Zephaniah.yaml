Zephaniah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son\
      \ of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah\
      \ the son of Amon, king of Judah. \n"
    2: "² I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the Lord. \n"
    3: "³ I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and\
      \ the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I will\
      \ cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and\
      \ the name of the Chemarims with the priests; \n"
    5: "⁵ And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that\
      \ worship and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham; \n"
    6: "⁶ And them that are turned back from the Lord; and those that have not sought\
      \ the Lord, nor enquired for him. \n"
    7: "⁷ Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of the Lord\
      \ is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will\
      \ punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with\
      \ strange apparel. \n"
    9: "⁹ In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold,\
      \ which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that there shall\
      \ be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second,\
      \ and a great crashing from the hills. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down;\
      \ all they that bear silver are cut off. \n"
    12: "¹² And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with\
      \ candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their\
      \ heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation:\
      \ they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards,\
      \ but not drink the wine thereof. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even\
      \ the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness\
      \ and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick\
      \ darkness, \n"
    16: "¹⁶ A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against\
      \ the high towers. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men,\
      \ because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured\
      \ out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the\
      \ day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire\
      \ of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that\
      \ dwell in the land."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before\
      \ the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger\
      \ come upon you. \n"
    3: "³ Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment;\
      \ seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of\
      \ the Lord's anger. \n"
    4: "⁴ For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive\
      \ out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up. \n"
    5: "⁵ Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites!\
      \ the word of the Lord is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines,\
      \ I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds\
      \ for flocks. \n"
    7: "⁷ And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall\
      \ feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening:\
      \ for the Lord their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity. \n"
    8: "⁸ I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of\
      \ Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against\
      \ their border. \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely\
      \ Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding\
      \ of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people\
      \ shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and\
      \ magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of\
      \ the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the\
      \ isles of the heathen. \n"
    12: "¹² Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword. \n"
    13: "¹³ And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria;\
      \ and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations:\
      \ both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it;\
      \ their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds;\
      \ for he shall uncover the cedar work. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart,
      I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for
      beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his
      hand.'
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! \n"
    2: "² She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in\
      \ the Lord; she drew not near to her God. \n"
    3: "³ Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves;\
      \ they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. \n"
    4: "⁴ Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted\
      \ the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. \n"
    5: "⁵ The just Lord is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning\
      \ doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth\
      \ no shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets\
      \ waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is\
      \ no man, that there is none inhabitant. \n"
    7: "⁷ I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their\
      \ dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early,\
      \ and corrupted all their doings. \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up\
      \ to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble\
      \ the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger:\
      \ for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. \n"
    9: "⁹ For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call\
      \ upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of\
      \ my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. \n"
    11: "¹¹ In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou\
      \ hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of\
      \ thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because\
      \ of my holy mountain. \n"
    12: "¹² I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and\
      \ they shall trust in the name of the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall\
      \ a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down,\
      \ and none shall make them afraid. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all\
      \ the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy:\
      \ the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not\
      \ see evil any more. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion,\
      \ Let not thine hands be slack. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will\
      \ rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee\
      \ with singing. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are\
      \ of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save\
      \ her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them\
      \ praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. \n"
    20: '²⁰ At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you:
      for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when
      I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.'
