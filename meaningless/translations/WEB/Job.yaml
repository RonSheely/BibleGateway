Job:
  1:
    1: '¹ There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless
      and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil. '
    2: '² There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. '
    3: '³ His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five
      hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household;
      so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. '
    4: '⁴ His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday;
      and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. '
    5: "⁵ It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job\
      \ sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt\
      \ offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that\
      \ my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,
      Satan also came among them. '
    7: "⁷ Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”\nThen Satan answered Yahweh,\
      \ and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and\
      \ down in it.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is\
      \ no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears\
      \ God, and turns away from evil.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? '
    10: '¹⁰ Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around
      all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and
      his substance is increased in the land. '
    11: "¹¹ But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will\
      \ renounce you to your face.” \n"
    12: "¹² Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only\
      \ on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence\
      \ of Yahweh. "
    13: '¹³ It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking
      wine in their oldest brother’s house, '
    14: '¹⁴ that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the
      donkeys feeding beside them, '
    15: "¹⁵ and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the\
      \ servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of\
      \ God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants,\
      \ and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans\
      \ made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away,\
      \ yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have\
      \ escaped to tell you.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your
      sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s
      house, '
    19: "¹⁹ and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the\
      \ four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead.\
      \ I alone have escaped to tell you.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down
      on the ground, and worshiped. '
    21: '²¹ He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return
      there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.” '
    22: ²² In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
  2:
    1: '¹ Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,
      Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh. '
    2: "² Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”\nSatan answered Yahweh,\
      \ and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and\
      \ down in it.” \n"
    3: "³ Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is\
      \ no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears\
      \ God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although\
      \ you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has
      he will give for his life. '
    5: "⁵ But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he\
      \ will renounce you to your face.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful
      sores from the sole of his foot to his head. '
    8: '⁸ He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among
      the ashes. '
    9: "⁹ Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce\
      \ God, and die.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak.\
      \ What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”\n\
      In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. "
    11: '¹¹ Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him,
      they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite,
      and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to
      sympathize with him and to comfort him. '
    12: '¹² When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him,
      they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled
      dust on their heads toward the sky. '
    13: ¹³ So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and
      no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.
  3:
    1: '¹ After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. '
    2: "² Job answered: \n"
    3: "³ “Let the day perish in which I was born,\n    the night which said, ‘There\
      \ is a boy conceived.’\n"
    4: "⁴ Let that day be darkness.\n    Don’t let God from above seek for it,\n \
      \   neither let the light shine on it.\n"
    5: "⁵ Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.\n    Let a\
      \ cloud dwell on it.\n    Let all that makes the day black terrify it.\n"
    6: "⁶ As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.\n    Let it not rejoice\
      \ among the days of the year.\n    Let it not come into the number of the months.\n"
    7: "⁷ Behold, let that night be barren.\n    Let no joyful voice come therein.\n"
    8: "⁸ Let them curse it who curse the day,\n    who are ready to rouse up leviathan.\n"
    9: "⁹ Let the stars of its twilight be dark.\n    Let it look for light, but have\
      \ none,\n    neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,\n    nor did\
      \ it hide trouble from my eyes. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Why didn’t I die from the womb?\n    Why didn’t I give up the spirit\
      \ when my mother bore me?\n"
    12: "¹² Why did the knees receive me?\n    Or why the breast, that I should nurse?\n"
    13: "¹³ For now I should have lain down and been quiet.\n    I should have slept,\
      \ then I would have been at rest,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ with kings and counselors of the earth,\n    who built up waste places\
      \ for themselves;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ or with princes who had gold,\n    who filled their houses with silver:\n"
    16: "¹⁶ or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,\n    as infants who never\
      \ saw light.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There the wicked cease from troubling.\n    There the weary are at rest.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ There the prisoners are at ease together.\n    They don’t hear the voice\
      \ of the taskmaster.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The small and the great are there.\n    The servant is free from his master.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Why is light given to him who is in misery,\n    life to the bitter in\
      \ soul,\n"
    21: "²¹ Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;\n    and dig for it more than\
      \ for hidden treasures,\n"
    22: "²² who rejoice exceedingly,\n    and are glad, when they can find the grave?\n"
    23: "²³ Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,\n    whom God has hedged\
      \ in?\n"
    24: "²⁴ For my sighing comes before I eat.\n    My groanings are poured out like\
      \ water.\n"
    25: "²⁵ For the thing which I fear comes on me,\n    That which I am afraid of\
      \ comes to me.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest;\n    but\
      \ trouble comes.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, \n"
    2: "² “If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?\n    But who\
      \ can withhold himself from speaking?\n"
    3: "³ Behold, you have instructed many,\n    you have strengthened the weak hands.\n"
    4: "⁴ Your words have supported him who was falling,\n    You have made the feeble\
      \ knees firm.\n"
    5: "⁵ But now it has come to you, and you faint.\n    It touches you, and you\
      \ are troubled.\n"
    6: "⁶ Isn’t your piety your confidence?\n    Isn’t the integrity of your ways\
      \ your hope? \n"
    7: "⁷ “Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?\n    Or where were the\
      \ upright cut off?\n"
    8: "⁸ According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,\n    and sow trouble,\n\
      \    reap the same.\n"
    9: "⁹ By the breath of God they perish.\n    By the blast of his anger are they\
      \ consumed.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The roaring of the lion,\n    and the voice of the fierce lion,\n    the\
      \ teeth of the young lions, are broken.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The old lion perishes for lack of prey.\n    The cubs of the lioness are\
      \ scattered abroad. \n"
    12: "¹² “Now a thing was secretly brought to me.\n    My ear received a whisper\
      \ of it.\n"
    13: "¹³ In thoughts from the visions of the night,\n    when deep sleep falls\
      \ on men,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ fear came on me, and trembling,\n    which made all my bones shake.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then a spirit passed before my face.\n    The hair of my flesh stood up.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.\n    A form was\
      \ before my eyes.\n    Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?\n    Shall a man be more pure\
      \ than his Maker?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.\n    He charges his angels with\
      \ error.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,\n    whose foundation\
      \ is in the dust,\n    who are crushed before the moth!\n"
    20: "²⁰ Between morning and evening they are destroyed.\n    They perish forever\
      \ without any regarding it.\n"
    21: "²¹ Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?\n    They die, and that\
      \ without wisdom.’"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Call now; is there any who will answer you?\n    To which of the holy ones\
      \ will you turn?\n"
    2: "² For resentment kills the foolish man,\n    and jealousy kills the simple.\n"
    3: "³ I have seen the foolish taking root,\n    but suddenly I cursed his habitation.\n"
    4: "⁴ His children are far from safety.\n    They are crushed in the gate.\n \
      \   Neither is there any to deliver them,\n"
    5: "⁵ whose harvest the hungry eats up,\n    and take it even out of the thorns.\n\
      \    The snare gapes for their substance.\n"
    6: "⁶ For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,\n    neither does trouble spring\
      \ out of the ground;\n"
    7: "⁷ but man is born to trouble,\n    as the sparks fly upward. \n"
    8: "⁸ “But as for me, I would seek God.\n    I would commit my cause to God,\n"
    9: "⁹ who does great things that can’t be fathomed,\n    marvelous things without\
      \ number;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ who gives rain on the earth,\n    and sends waters on the fields;\n"
    11: "¹¹ so that he sets up on high those who are low,\n    those who mourn are\
      \ exalted to safety.\n"
    12: "¹² He frustrates the plans of the crafty,\n    So that their hands can’t\
      \ perform their enterprise.\n"
    13: "¹³ He takes the wise in their own craftiness;\n    the counsel of the cunning\
      \ is carried headlong.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They meet with darkness in the day time,\n    and grope at noonday as\
      \ in the night.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But he saves from the sword of their mouth,\n    even the needy from the\
      \ hand of the mighty.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ So the poor has hope,\n    and injustice shuts her mouth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.\n    Therefore do not despise\
      \ the chastening of the Almighty.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For he wounds and binds up.\n    He injures and his hands make whole.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will deliver you in six troubles;\n    yes, in seven no evil will touch\
      \ you.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In famine he will redeem you from death;\n    in war, from the power of\
      \ the sword.\n"
    21: "²¹ You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,\n    neither will you\
      \ be afraid of destruction when it comes.\n"
    22: "²² You will laugh at destruction and famine,\n    neither will you be afraid\
      \ of the animals of the earth.\n"
    23: "²³ For you will be allied with the stones of the field.\n    The animals\
      \ of the field will be at peace with you.\n"
    24: "²⁴ You will know that your tent is in peace.\n    You will visit your fold,\
      \ and will miss nothing.\n"
    25: "²⁵ You will know also that your offspring will be great,\n    Your offspring\
      \ as the grass of the earth.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will come to your grave in a full age,\n    like a shock of grain\
      \ comes in its season.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Look at this. We have searched it. It is so.\n    Hear it, and know it\
      \ for your good.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Then Job answered, \n"
    2: "² “Oh that my anguish were weighed,\n    and all my calamity laid in the balances!\n"
    3: "³ For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,\n    therefore my\
      \ words have been rash.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.\n    My spirit drinks up their\
      \ poison.\nThe terrors of God set themselves in array against me.\n"
    5: "⁵     Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?\nOr does the ox low over\
      \ his fodder?\n"
    6: "⁶     Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?\nOr is there any\
      \ taste in the white of an egg?\n"
    7: "⁷     My soul refuses to touch them.\nThey are as loathsome food to me. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Oh that I might have my request,\n    that God would grant the thing that\
      \ I long for,\n"
    9: "⁹ even that it would please God to crush me;\n    that he would let loose\
      \ his hand, and cut me off!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Let it still be my consolation,\n    yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t\
      \ spare,\n    that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.\n"
    11: "¹¹ What is my strength, that I should wait?\n    What is my end, that I should\
      \ be patient?\n"
    12: "¹² Is my strength the strength of stones?\n    Or is my flesh of bronze?\n"
    13: "¹³ Isn’t it that I have no help in me,\n    that wisdom is driven away from\
      \ me? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;\n\
      \    even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,\n    as the channel of\
      \ brooks that pass away;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Which are black by reason of the ice,\n    in which the snow hides itself.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ In the dry season, they vanish.\n    When it is hot, they are consumed\
      \ out of their place.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The caravans that travel beside them turn away.\n    They go up into the\
      \ waste, and perish.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The caravans of Tema looked.\n    The companies of Sheba waited for them.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They were distressed because they were confident.\n    They came there,\
      \ and were confounded.\n"
    21: "²¹ For now you are nothing.\n    You see a terror, and are afraid.\n"
    22: "²² Did I say, ‘Give to me?’\n    or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’\n"
    23: "²³ or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’\n    or, ‘Redeem me from the\
      \ hand of the oppressors?’ \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Teach me, and I will hold my peace.\n    Cause me to understand my error.\n"
    25: "²⁵ How forcible are words of uprightness!\n    But your reproof, what does\
      \ it reprove?\n"
    26: "²⁶ Do you intend to reprove words,\n    since the speeches of one who is\
      \ desperate are as wind?\n"
    27: "²⁷ Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,\n    and make merchandise\
      \ of your friend.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Now therefore be pleased to look at me,\n    for surely I will not lie\
      \ to your face.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Please return.\n    Let there be no injustice.\n    Yes, return again.\n\
      \    My cause is righteous.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Is there injustice on my tongue?\n    Can’t my taste discern mischievous\
      \ things?"
  7:
    1: "¹ “Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth?\n    Aren’t his days like the days\
      \ of a hired hand?\n"
    2: "² As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,\n    as a hireling who looks\
      \ for his wages,\n"
    3: "³ so I am made to possess months of misery,\n    wearisome nights are appointed\
      \ to me.\n"
    4: "⁴ When I lie down, I say,\n    ‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’\n\
      \    I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.\n"
    5: "⁵ My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.\n    My skin closes up,\
      \ and breaks out afresh.\n"
    6: "⁶ My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,\n    and are spent without\
      \ hope.\n"
    7: "⁷ Oh remember that my life is a breath.\n    My eye will no more see good.\n"
    8: "⁸ The eye of him who sees me will see me no more.\n    Your eyes will be on\
      \ me, but I will not be.\n"
    9: "⁹ As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,\n    so he who goes down to\
      \ Sheol will come up no more.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He will return no more to his house,\n    neither will his place know\
      \ him any more. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Therefore I will not keep silent.\n    I will speak in the anguish of\
      \ my spirit.\n    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.\n"
    12: "¹² Am I a sea, or a sea monster,\n    that you put a guard over me?\n"
    13: "¹³ When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me.\n    My couch will ease my complaint;’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ then you scare me with dreams,\n    and terrify me through visions:\n"
    15: "¹⁵ so that my soul chooses strangling,\n    death rather than my bones.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I loathe my life.\n    I don’t want to live forever.\n    Leave me alone,\
      \ for my days are but a breath.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ What is man, that you should magnify him,\n    that you should set your\
      \ mind on him,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ that you should visit him every morning,\n    and test him every moment?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ How long will you not look away from me,\n    nor leave me alone until\
      \ I swallow down my spittle?\n"
    20: "²⁰ If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?\n    Why have\
      \ you set me as a mark for you,\n    so that I am a burden to myself?\n"
    21: "²¹ Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?\n  \
      \  For now will I lie down in the dust.\n    You will seek me diligently, but\
      \ I will not be.”"
  8:
    1: "¹ Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, \n"
    2: "² “How long will you speak these things?\n    Shall the words of your mouth\
      \ be a mighty wind?\n"
    3: "³ Does God pervert justice?\n    Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?\n"
    4: "⁴ If your children have sinned against him,\n    he has delivered them into\
      \ the hand of their disobedience.\n"
    5: "⁵ If you want to seek God diligently,\n    make your supplication to the Almighty.\n"
    6: "⁶ If you were pure and upright,\n    surely now he would awaken for you,\n\
      and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.\n"
    7: "⁷     Though your beginning was small,\nyet your latter end would greatly\
      \ increase. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Please inquire of past generations.\n    Find out about the learning of\
      \ their fathers.\n"
    9: "⁹ (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,\n    because our days on\
      \ earth are a shadow.)\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Shall they not teach you, tell you,\n    and utter words out of their\
      \ heart? \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Can the papyrus grow up without mire?\n    Can the rushes grow without\
      \ water?\n"
    12: "¹² While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,\n    it withers before\

    2: '² Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of

    27: "²⁷ He sings before men, and says,\n    ‘I have sinned, and perverted that\
