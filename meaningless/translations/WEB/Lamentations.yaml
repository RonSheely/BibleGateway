Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "¹ How the city sits solitary,\n    that was full of people!\nShe has become\
      \ as a widow,\n    who was great among the nations!\nShe who was a princess\
      \ among the provinces\n    has become a slave! \n"
    2: "² She weeps bitterly in the night.\n    Her tears are on her cheeks.\nAmong\
      \ all her lovers\n    she has no one to comfort her.\nAll her friends have dealt\
      \ treacherously with her.\n    They have become her enemies. \n"
    3: "³ Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction,\n    and because of\
      \ great servitude.\nShe dwells among the nations.\n    She finds no rest.\n\
      \    All her persecutors overtook her within the straits. \n"
    4: "⁴ The roads to Zion mourn,\n    because no one comes to the solemn assembly.\n\
      All her gates are desolate.\n    Her priests sigh.\nHer virgins are afflicted,\n\
      \    and she herself is in bitterness. \n"
    5: "⁵ Her adversaries have become the head.\n    Her enemies prosper;\nfor Yahweh\
      \ has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions.\n    Her young\
      \ children have gone into captivity before the adversary. \n"
    6: "⁶ All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion.\n    Her princes have\
      \ become like deer that find no pasture.\n    They have gone without strength\
      \ before the pursuer. \n"
    7: "⁷ Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries\n\
      \    all her pleasant things that were from the days of old;\nwhen her people\
      \ fell into the hand of the adversary,\n    and no one helped her.\nThe adversaries\
      \ saw her.\n    They mocked at her desolations. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem has grievously sinned.\n    Therefore she has become unclean.\n\
      All who honored her despise her,\n    because they have seen her nakedness.\n\
      \    Yes, she sighs, and turns backward. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her filthiness was in her skirts.\n    She didn’t remember her latter end.\n\
      Therefore she has come down astoundingly.\n    She has no comforter.\n“See,\
      \ Yahweh, my affliction;\n    for the enemy has magnified himself.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things;\n  \
      \  for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary,\n    concerning\
      \ whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly. \n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people sigh.\n    They seek bread.\n    They have given their\
      \ pleasant things for food to refresh their soul.\n“Look, Yahweh, and see;\n\
      \    for I have become despised.” \n"
    12: "¹² “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n    Look, and see if there\
      \ is any sorrow like my sorrow,\n    which is brought on me,\n    with which\
      \ Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. \n"
    13: "¹³ “From on high has he sent fire into my bones,\n    and it prevails against\
      \ them.\nHe has spread a net for my feet.\n    He has turned me back.\n    He\
      \ has made me desolate and I faint all day long. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.\n    They are knit\
      \ together.\n    They have come up on my neck.\n    He made my strength fail.\n\
      The Lord has delivered me into their hands,\n    against whom I am not able\
      \ to stand. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me.\n    He has\
      \ called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.\n    The Lord has\
      \ trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “For these things I weep.\n    My eye, my eye runs down with water,\n\
      \    because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.\nMy children\
      \ are desolate,\n    because the enemy has prevailed.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion spreads out her hands.\n    There is no one to comfort her.\nYahweh\
      \ has commanded concerning Jacob,\n    that those who are around him should\
      \ be his adversaries.\n    Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Yahweh is righteous;\n    for I have rebelled against his commandment.\n\
      Please hear all you peoples,\n    and see my sorrow.\n    My virgins and my\
      \ young men have gone into captivity. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I called for my lovers,\n    but they deceived me.\nMy priests and my\
      \ elders gave up the spirit in the city,\n    while they sought food for themselves\
      \ to refresh their souls. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Look, Yahweh; for I am in distress.\n    My heart is troubled.\nMy heart\
      \ turns over within me,\n    for I have grievously rebelled.\nAbroad, the sword\
      \ bereaves.\n    At home, it is like death. \n"
    21: "²¹ “They have heard that I sigh.\n    There is no one to comfort me.\nAll\
      \ my enemies have heard of my trouble.\n    They are glad that you have done\
      \ it.\nYou will bring the day that you have proclaimed,\n    and they will be\
      \ like me. \n"
    22: "²² “Let all their wickedness come before you.\n    Do to them as you have\
      \ done to me for all my transgressions.\nFor my sighs are many,\n    and my\
      \ heart is faint."
  2:
    1: "¹ How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!\n\
      \    He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth,\n    and\
      \ hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. \n"
    2: "² The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob\n    without pity.\n\
      He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.\n\
      \    He has brought them down to the ground.\n    He has profaned the kingdom\
      \ and its princes. \n"
    3: "³ He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger.\n    He has drawn\
      \ back his right hand from before the enemy.\nHe has burned up Jacob like a\
      \ flaming fire,\n    which devours all around. \n"
    4: "⁴ He has bent his bow like an enemy.\n    He has stood with his right hand\
      \ as an adversary.\nHe has killed all that were pleasant to the eye.\n    In\
      \ the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord has become as an enemy.\n    He has swallowed up Israel.\nHe has\
      \ swallowed up all her palaces.\n    He has destroyed his strongholds.\n   \
      \ He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah. \n"
    6: "⁶ He has violently taken away his tabernacle,\n    as if it were a garden.\n\
      He has destroyed his place of assembly.\n    Yahweh has caused solemn assembly\
      \ and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion.\n    In the indignation of his anger,\
      \ he has despised the king and the priest. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has cast off his altar.\n    He has abhorred his sanctuary.\nHe\
      \ has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy.\n    They have\
      \ made a noise in Yahweh’s house,\n    as in the day of a solemn assembly. \n"
    8: "⁸ Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.\n    He\
      \ has stretched out the line.\n    He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;\n\
      He has made the rampart and wall lament.\n    They languish together. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground.\n    He has destroyed and broken her\
      \ bars.\nHer king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not.\n\
      \    Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground.\n    They keep silence.\n\
      They have cast up dust on their heads.\n    They have clothed themselves with\
      \ sackcloth.\n    The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ My eyes fail with tears.\n    My heart is troubled.\nMy liver is poured\
      \ on the earth,\n    because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,\n\
      \    because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the\
      \ city. \n"
    12: "¹² They ask their mothers,\n    “Where is grain and wine?”\n    when they\
      \ swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,\n    when their soul is poured\
      \ out into their mothers’ bosom. \n"
    13: "¹³ What shall I testify to you?\n    What shall I liken to you, daughter\
      \ of Jerusalem?\nWhat shall I compare to you,\n    that I may comfort you, virgin\
      \ daughter of Zion?\nFor your breach is as big as the sea.\n    Who can heal\
      \ you? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you.\n    They have\
      \ not uncovered your iniquity,\n    to reverse your captivity,\n    but have\
      \ seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All that pass by clap their hands at you.\n    They hiss and wag their\
      \ head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,\n“Is this the city that men called\
      \ ‘The perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of the whole earth’?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.\n    They hiss\
      \ and gnash their teeth.\n    They say, “We have swallowed her up.\nCertainly\
      \ this is the day that we looked for.\n    We have found it.\n    We have seen\
      \ it.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Yahweh has done that which he planned.\n    He has fulfilled his word\
      \ that he commanded in the days of old.\nHe has thrown down,\n    and has not\
      \ pitied.\nHe has caused the enemy to rejoice over you.\n    He has exalted\
      \ the horn of your adversaries. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their heart cried to the Lord.\n    O wall of the daughter of Zion,\n\
      \    let tears run down like a river day and night.\nGive yourself no relief.\n\
      \    Don’t let your eyes rest. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Arise, cry out in the night,\n    at the beginning of the watches!\nPour\
      \ out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.\n    Lift up your hands\
      \ toward him for the life of your young children,\n    who faint for hunger\
      \ at the head of every street. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!\n    Should the women\
      \ eat their offspring,\n    the children that they held and bounced on their\
      \ knees?\n    Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of\
      \ the Lord? \n"
    21: "²¹ “The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.\n    My virgins\
      \ and my young men have fallen by the sword.\nYou have killed them in the day\
      \ of your anger.\n    You have slaughtered, and not pitied. \n"
    22: "²² “You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every\
      \ side.\n    There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s\
      \ anger.\n    My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought\
      \ up."
  3:
    1: "¹ I am the man who has seen affliction\n    by the rod of his wrath.\n"
    2: "² He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,\n    and not in light.\n"
    3: "³ Surely he turns his hand against me\n    again and again all day long. \n"
    4: "⁴ He has made my flesh and my skin old.\n    He has broken my bones.\n"
    5: "⁵ He has built against me,\n    and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.\n"
    6: "⁶ He has made me dwell in dark places,\n    as those who have been long dead.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.\n    He has made my chain\
      \ heavy.\n"
    8: "⁸ Yes, when I cry, and call for help,\n    he shuts out my prayer.\n"
    9: "⁹ He has walled up my ways with cut stone.\n    He has made my paths crooked.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He is to me as a bear lying in wait,\n    as a lion in secret places.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He has turned away my ways,\n    and pulled me in pieces.\n    He has\
      \ made me desolate.\n"
    12: "¹² He has bent his bow,\n    and set me as a mark for the arrow. \n"
    13: "¹³ He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.\n"
    14: "¹⁴     I have become a derision to all my people,\n    and their song all\
      \ day long.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He has filled me with bitterness.\n    He has stuffed me with wormwood.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He has also broken my teeth with gravel.\n    He has covered me with ashes.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ You have removed my soul far away from peace.\n    I forgot prosperity.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I said, “My strength has perished,\n    along with my expectation from\
      \ Yahweh.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Remember my affliction and my misery,\n    the wormwood and the bitterness.\n"
    20: "²⁰ My soul still remembers them,\n    and is bowed down within me.\n"
    21: "²¹ This I recall to my mind;\n    therefore I have hope. \n"
    22: "²² It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,\n\
      \    because his compassion doesn’t fail.\n"
    23: "²³ They are new every morning.\n    Great is your faithfulness.\n"
    24: "²⁴ “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul.\n    “Therefore I will hope in him.”\
      \ \n"
    25: "²⁵ Yahweh is good to those who wait for him,\n    to the soul who seeks him.\n"
    26: "²⁶ It is good that a man should hope\n    and quietly wait for the salvation\
      \ of Yahweh.\n"
    27: "²⁷     It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Let him sit alone and keep silence,\n    because he has laid it on him.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Let him put his mouth in the dust,\n    if it is so that there may be\
      \ hope.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.\n    Let him be filled\
      \ full of reproach. \n"
    31: "³¹ For the Lord will not cast off forever.\n"
    32: "³²     For though he causes grief,\n    yet he will have compassion according\
      \ to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.\n"
    33: "³³ For he does not afflict willingly,\n    nor grieve the children of men.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,\n"
    35: "³⁵     to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,\n"
    36: "³⁶     to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,\n    when the Lord doesn’t command\
      \ it?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?\n"

    1: "¹ How the gold has become dim!\n    The most pure gold has changed!\nThe stones\
      \ of the sanctuary are poured out\n    at the head of every street. \n"
    2: "² The precious sons of Zion,\n    comparable to fine gold,\nhow they are esteemed\

    3: "³ Even the jackals offer their breast.\n    They nurse their young ones.\n\
      But the daughter of my people has become cruel,\n    like the ostriches in the\

    5: "⁵ Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.\n    Those who were\
      \ brought up in purple embrace dunghills. \n"
    6: "⁶ For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of\
      \ Sodom,\n    which was overthrown as in a moment.\n    No hands were laid on\
      \ her. \n"
    7: "⁷ Her nobles were purer than snow.\n    They were whiter than milk.\nThey\

      \ become like a stick. \n"
    9: "⁹ Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed\

      \  “They can’t live here any more.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Yahweh’s anger has scattered them.\n    He will not pay attention to them\
      \ any more.\nThey didn’t respect the persons of the priests.\n    They didn’t\
      \ favor the elders. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Our eyes still fail,\n    looking in vain for our help.\n    In our watching\

    18: "¹⁸ They hunt our steps,\n    so that we can’t go in our streets.\nOur end\
      \ is near.\n    Our days are fulfilled,\n    for our end has come. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.\n    They chased\

    21: "²¹ Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,\n    who dwells in the land of\
      \ Uz.\nThe cup will pass through to you also.\n    You will be drunken,\n  \
      \  and will make yourself naked. \n"
    22: "²² The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.\n \
      \   He will no more carry you away into captivity.\nHe will visit your iniquity,\
