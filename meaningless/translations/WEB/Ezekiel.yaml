Ezekiel:
  1:
    1: "¹ Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the\
      \ month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened,\
      \ and I saw visions of God. \n"
    2: '² In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s
      captivity, '
    3: "³ Yahweh’s word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of\
      \ the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and Yahweh’s hand was there on him. \n"
    4: '⁴ I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud,
      with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of the middle of
      it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire. '
    5: '⁵ Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their
      appearance: They had the likeness of a man. '
    6: '⁶ Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. '
    7: '⁷ Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole
      of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. '
    8: '⁸ They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four
      of them had their faces and their wings like this: '
    9: "⁹ Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went.\
      \ Each one went straight forward. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four
      of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face
      of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle. '
    11: '¹¹ Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of
      each one touched another, and two covered their bodies. '
    12: '¹² Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went.
      They didn’t turn when they went. '
    13: '¹³ As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like
      burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and
      down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out
      of the fire. '
    14: "¹⁴ The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of\
      \ lightning. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the
      earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. '
    16: '¹⁶ The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four
      of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel
      within a wheel. '
    17: '¹⁷ When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when
      they went. '
    18: "¹⁸ As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had\
      \ their rims full of eyes all around. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the
      living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. '
    20: '²⁰ Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there.
      The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature
      was in the wheels. '
    21: "²¹ When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those\
      \ were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for\
      \ the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. \n"
    22: '²² Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse,
      like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above. '
    23: '²³ Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each
      one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their
      bodies on that side. '
    24: "²⁴ When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great\
      \ waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of\
      \ an army. When they stood, they let down their wings. \n"
    25: '²⁵ There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they
      stood, they let down their wings. '
    26: '²⁶ Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne,
      as the appearance of a sapphire stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness
      as the appearance of a man on it above. '
    27: '²⁷ I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all
      around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance
      of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there
      was brightness around him. '
    28: "²⁸ As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain,\
      \ so was the appearance of the brightness all around.\nThis was the appearance\
      \ of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I\
      \ heard a voice of one that spoke."
  2:
    1: '¹ He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” '
    2: "² The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and\
      \ I heard him who spoke to me. \n"
    3: '³ He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation
      of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed
      against me even to this very day. '
    4: '⁴ The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and
      you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’ '
    5: '⁵ They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse, for they are
      a rebellious house, yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them. '
    6: '⁶ You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words,
      though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Don’t
      be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a
      rebellious house. '
    7: '⁷ You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they
      will refuse; for they are most rebellious. '
    8: "⁸ But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that\
      \ rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.” \n"
    9: '⁹ When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and, behold, a scroll
      of a book was in it. '
    10: ¹⁰ He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations,
      mourning, and woe were written in it.
  3:
    1: "¹ He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go,\
      \ speak to the house of Israel.” \n"
    2: "² So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll. \n"
    3: "³ He said to me, “Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels\
      \ with this scroll that I give you.”\nThen I ate it; and it was as sweet as\
      \ honey in my mouth. \n"
    4: '⁴ He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words
      to them. '
    5: '⁵ For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language,
      but to the house of Israel; '
    6: '⁶ not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words
      you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. '
    7: '⁷ But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen
      to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard-hearted. '
    8: '⁸ Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead
      hard against their foreheads. '
    9: "⁹ I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid\
      \ of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious\
      \ house.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with
      your ears all my words that I speak to you. '
    11: "¹¹ Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak\
      \ to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says,’ whether they\
      \ will hear, or whether they will refuse.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great
      rushing, saying, “Blessed be Yahweh’s glory from his place.” '
    13: '¹³ I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched
      one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great
      rushing. '
    14: '¹⁴ So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness,
      in the heat of my spirit; and Yahweh’s hand was strong on me. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river\
      \ Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven\
      \ days. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At the end of seven days, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore
      hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me. '
    18: '¹⁸ When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning,
      nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked
      man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand. '
    19: "¹⁹ Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor\
      \ from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your\
      \ soul.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits
      iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have
      not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which
      he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand. '
    21: "²¹ Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin,\
      \ and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you\
      \ have delivered your soul.” \n"
    22: "²² Yahweh’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into\
      \ the plain, and I will talk with you there.” \n"
    23: "²³ Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, Yahweh’s glory\
      \ stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. Then I fell on\
      \ my face. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet. He spoke with
      me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house. '
    25: '²⁵ But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind
      you with them, and you will not go out among them. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will
      be mute, and will not be able to correct them; for they are a rebellious house. '
    27: ²⁷ But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them,
      ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who
      refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.”
  4:
    1: '¹ “You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray
      on it a city, even Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against
      it. Also set camps against it and plant battering rams against it all around. '
    3: "³ Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you\
      \ and the city. Then set your face toward it. It will be besieged, and you shall\
      \ lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel
      on it. According to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall
      bear their iniquity. '
    5: "⁵ For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of\
      \ days, even three hundred ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the\
      \ house of Israel. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side,
      and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days,
      each day for a year, to you. '
    7: '⁷ You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered;
      and you shall prophesy against it. '
    8: "⁸ Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side\
      \ to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt,
      and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it. According to the number of the
      days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall
      eat of it. '
    10: '¹⁰ Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day.
      From time to time you shall eat it. '
    11: '¹¹ You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to
      time you shall drink. '
    12: '¹² You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight
      with dung that comes out of man.” '
    13: "¹³ Yahweh said, “Even thus will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean,\
      \ among the nations where I will drive them.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for\
      \ from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself,\
      \ or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung,\
      \ and you shall prepare your bread on it.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of
      bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness. They
      will drink water by measure, and in dismay; '
    17: ¹⁷ that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine
      away in their iniquity.
  5:
    1: '¹ “You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor
      to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over your head and over your beard.
      Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair. '
    2: '² A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when
      the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall take a third part, and strike
      with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I
      will draw out a sword after them. '
    3: '³ You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in the folds of your
      robe. '
    4: "⁴ Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire,\
      \ and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle
      of the nations, and countries are around her. '
    6: "⁶ She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the\
      \ nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her;\
      \ for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not\
      \ walked in them.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the
      nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have
      kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that
      are around you; '
    8: '⁸ therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and
      I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations. '
    9: '⁹ I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything
      like it any more, because of all your abominations. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will
      eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you; and I will scatter the whole
      remnant of you to all the winds. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely, because you have
      defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations,
      therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity. '
    12: "¹² A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed\
      \ with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A\
      \ third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after\
      \ them. \n"
    13: "¹³ “‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward\
      \ them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, Yahweh, have\
      \ spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations
      that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by. '
    15: '¹⁵ So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment,
      to the nations that are around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger
      and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, Yahweh, have spoken it— '
    16: '¹⁶ when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction,
      which I will send to destroy you. I will increase the famine on you, and will
      break your staff of bread. '
    17: ¹⁷ I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you.
      Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I will bring the sword on you. I,
      Yahweh, have spoken it.’”
  6:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy
      to them, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The
      Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and
      to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy
      your high places. '
    4: '⁴ Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken.
      I will cast down your slain men before your idols. '
    5: '⁵ I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols.
      I will scatter your bones around your altars. '
    6: '⁶ In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high
      places will be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate,
      and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down,
      and your works may be abolished. '
    7: "⁷ The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘“Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the
      sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries. '
    9: '⁹ Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are
      carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed
      from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then
      they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have
      committed in all their abominations. '
    10: "¹⁰ They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would\
      \ do this evil to them.”’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot,
      and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel;
      for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. '
    12: '¹² He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall
      by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I
      will accomplish my wrath on them. '
    13: '¹³ You will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men are among their idols
      around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under
      every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant
      aroma to all their idols. '
    14: ¹⁴ I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste,
      from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. Then they
      will know that I am Yahweh.’”
  7:
    1: '¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “You, son of man, the Lord Yahweh says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The
      end has come on the four corners of the land. '
    3: '³ Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you
      according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. '
    4: "⁴ My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your\
      \ ways on you, and your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that\
      \ I am Yahweh.’ \n"
    5: '⁵ “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘An evil! A unique evil! Behold, it comes. '
    6: '⁶ An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes. '
    7: '⁷ Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The
      day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains. '
    8: '⁸ Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against
      you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your
      abominations. '
    9: "⁹ My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according\
      \ to your ways. Your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that\
      \ I, Yahweh, strike. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has
      blossomed. Pride has budded. '
    11: '¹¹ Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain,
      nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There will be nothing of value
      among them. '
    12: '¹² The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor
      the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude. '
    13: '¹³ For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still
      alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude of it. None will return.
      None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. '
    14: "¹⁴ They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes\
      \ to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who
      is in the field will die by the sword. He who is in the city will be devoured
      by famine and pestilence. '
    16: '¹⁶ But those of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains
      like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity. '
    17: '¹⁷ All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water. '
    18: '¹⁸ They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover
      them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. '
    19: '¹⁹ They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as
      an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to deliver them
      in the day of Yahweh’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls or fill their bellies;
      because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity. '
    20: '²⁰ As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made
      the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein. Therefore
      I have made it to them as an unclean thing. '
    21: '²¹ I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the
      wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will profane it. '
    22: "²² I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place.\
      \ Robbers will enter into it, and profane it. \n"
    23: '²³ “‘Make chains; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is
      full of violence. '
    24: '²⁴ Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess
      their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease. Their holy
      places will be profaned. '
    25: '²⁵ Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none. '
    26: '²⁶ Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will
      seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel
      from the elders. '
    27: ²⁷ The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The
      hands of the people of the land will be troubled. I will do to them after their
      way, and according to their own judgments I will judge them. Then they will
      know that I am Yahweh.’”
  8:
    1: '¹ In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as
      I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the Lord Yahweh’s
      hand fell on me there. '
    2: '² Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance
      of his waist and downward, fire; and from his waist and upward, as the appearance
      of brightness, as it were glowing metal. '
    3: '³ He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and
      the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions
      of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward
      the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes
      to jealousy. '
    4: "⁴ Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance\
      \ that I saw in the plain. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the\
      \ north.”\nSo I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward\
      \ of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. \n"
    6: "⁶ He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations\
      \ that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?\
      \ But you will again see yet other great abominations.” \n"
    7: '⁷ He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole
      in the wall. '
    8: "⁸ Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.”\nWhen I had dug in\
      \ the wall, I saw a door. \n"
    9: "⁹ He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable
      animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall. '
    11: "¹¹ Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In\
      \ the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood, every man with his\
      \ censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up. \n"
    12: '¹² Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the
      house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they
      say, ‘Yahweh doesn’t see us. Yahweh has forsaken the land.’” '
    13: "¹³ He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations\
      \ which they do.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh’s house which was
      toward the north; and I saw the women sit there weeping for Tammuz. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see\
      \ yet greater abominations than these.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh’s house; and I saw at the\
      \ door of Yahweh’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about\
      \ twenty-five men, with their backs toward Yahweh’s temple, and their faces\
      \ toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing
      to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here?
      For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke
      me to anger. Behold, they put the branch to their nose. '
    18: ¹⁸ Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I
      have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear
      them.”
  9:
    1: '¹ Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are
      in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his
      hand.” '
    2: "² Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the\
      \ north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle\
      \ of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went\
      \ in, and stood beside the bronze altar. \n"
    3: '³ The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was,
      to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who
      had the writer’s inkhorn by his side. '
    4: "⁴ Yahweh said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle\
      \ of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that\
      \ cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” \n"
    5: '⁵ To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and
      strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity. '
    6: "⁶ Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and\
      \ women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.”\n\
      Then they began at the old men who were before the house. \n"
    7: "⁷ He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain.\
      \ Go out!”\nThey went out, and struck in the city. "
    8: "⁸ While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and\
      \ said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your\
      \ pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly
      great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they
      say, ‘Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn’t see.’ '
    10: "¹⁰ As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will\
      \ bring their way on their head.” \n"
    11: ¹¹ Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported
      the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.”
  10:
    1: '¹ Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim
      there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of
      the likeness of a throne. '
    2: "² He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling\
      \ wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire\
      \ from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.”\nHe went in as\
      \ I watched. "
    3: '³ Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went
      in; and the cloud filled the inner court. '
    4: '⁴ Yahweh’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold
      of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full
      of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory. '
    5: "⁵ The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court,\
      \ as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. \n"
    6: '⁶ It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take
      fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went
      in, and stood beside a wheel. '
    7: '⁷ The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire
      that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands
      of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. '
    8: "⁸ The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel
      beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of
      the wheels was like a beryl stone. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel
      within a wheel. '
    11: '¹¹ When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as
      they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t
      turn as they went. '
    12: '¹² Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and
      the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them
      had. '
    13: '¹³ As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”. '
    14: "¹⁴ Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub.\
      \ The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion.\
      \ The fourth was the face of an eagle. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the
      river Chebar. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim
      lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn
      from beside them. '
    17: "¹⁷ When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with\
      \ them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood
      over the cherubim. '
    19: "¹⁹ The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my\
      \ sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at\
      \ the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel\
      \ was over them above. \n"
    20: '²⁰ This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the
      river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. '
    21: '²¹ Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the
      hands of a man was under their wings. '
    22: ²² As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by
      the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight
      forward.
  11:
    1: '¹ Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Yahweh’s
      house, which looks eastward. Behold, twenty-five men were at the door of the
      gate; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son
      of Benaiah, princes of the people. '
    2: '² He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who
      give wicked counsel in this city; '
    3: '³ who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and
      we are the meat.’ '
    4: "⁴ Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Yahweh’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘Yahweh says: “Thus
      you have said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. '
    6: "⁶ You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets\
      \ with the slain.” \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the
      middle of it, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you will be brought
      out of the middle of it. '
    8: '⁸ You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the
      Lord Yahweh. '
    9: '⁹ “I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands
      of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel.
      Then you will know that I am Yahweh. '
    11: '¹¹ This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle
      of it. I will judge you in the border of Israel. '
    12: "¹² You will know that I am Yahweh, for you have not walked in my statutes,\
      \ You have not executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of\
      \ the nations that are around you.”’” \n"
    13: "¹³ When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down\
      \ on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you\
      \ make a full end of the remnant of Israel?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    15: "¹⁵ “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives,\
      \ and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they to whom the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from Yahweh. This land has been given\
      \ to us for a possession.’ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Whereas I have removed them far\
      \ off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries,\
      \ yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where\
      \ they have come.”’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will gather you from the peoples,\
      \ and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I\
      \ will give you the land of Israel.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things
      and all its abominations from there. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I
      will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of
      flesh; '
    20: '²⁰ that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them.
      They will be my people, and I will be their God. '
    21: "²¹ But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable\
      \ things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads,’\
      \ says the Lord Yahweh.” \n"
    22: '²² Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them.
      The glory of the God of Israel was over them above. '
    23: '²³ Yahweh’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain
      which is on the east side of the city. '
    24: "²⁴ The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of\
      \ God into Chaldea, to the captives.\nSo the vision that I had seen went up\
      \ from me. "
    25: ²⁵ Then I spoke to the captives all the things that Yahweh had shown me.
  12:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word also came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes\
      \ to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear, and don’t hear; for they are\
      \ a rebellious house. \n"
    3: '³ “Therefore, you son of man, prepare your stuff for moving, and move by day
      in their sight. You shall move from your place to another place in their sight.
      It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house. '
    4: '⁴ You shall bring out your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving.
      You shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go out into
      exile. '
    5: '⁵ Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your stuff out that way. '
    6: "⁶ In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the\
      \ dark. You shall cover your face, so that you don’t see the land, for I have\
      \ set you for a sign to the house of Israel.” \n"
    7: "⁷ I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my stuff by day, as stuff for\
      \ moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought\
      \ it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight. \n"
    8: '⁸ In the morning, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    9: "⁹ “Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you,\
      \ ‘What are you doing?’ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “This burden concerns the prince\
      \ in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.”’ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They\
      \ will go into exile, into captivity. \n"
    12: '¹² “‘The prince who is among them will bear on his shoulder in the dark,
      and will go out. They will dig through the wall to carry things out that way.
      He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes. '
    13: '¹³ I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I
      will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see
      it, though he will die there. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and\
      \ all his bands. I will draw out the sword after them. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘They will know that I am Yahweh when I disperse them among the nations,
      and scatter them through the countries. '
    16: "¹⁶ But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and\
      \ from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the\
      \ nations where they come. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling
      and with fearfulness. '
    19: '¹⁹ Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lord Yahweh says concerning the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread with fearfulness,
      and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that

    20: "²⁰ The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be\
      \ a desolation. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”’” \n"
    21: '²¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    22: '²² “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel,
      saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?’ '
    23: '²³ Tell them therefore, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will make this proverb
      to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel;”’ but tell them,
      ‘“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision. '
    24: '²⁴ For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within
      the house of Israel. '
    25: "²⁵ For I am Yahweh. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed.\
      \ It will be no more deferred; for in your days, rebellious house, I will speak\
      \ the word, and will perform it,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    27: "²⁷ “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that\
      \ he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far\
      \ off.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “None of my words will be
      deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lord
      Yahweh.’”'
  13:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say
      to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: '
    3: '³ The Lord Yahweh says, “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own
      spirit, and have seen nothing! '
    4: '⁴ Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places. '
    5: '⁵ You have not gone up into the gaps or built up the wall for the house of
      Israel, to stand in the battle in Yahweh’s day. '
    6: '⁶ They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but
      Yahweh has not sent them. They have made men to hope that the word would be
      confirmed. '
    7: "⁷ Haven’t you seen a false vision, and haven’t you spoken a lying divination,\
      \ in that you say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but I have not spoken?” \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have spoken falsehood and
      seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,” says the Lord Yahweh. '
    9: "⁹ “My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who utter\
      \ lying divinations. They will not be in the council of my people, neither will\
      \ they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter\
      \ into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;”
      and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall, behold, they plaster it with
      whitewash. '
    11: '¹¹ Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will
      be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind
      will tear it. '
    12: "¹² Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the\
      \ plaster with which you have plastered it?” \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind
      in my wrath. There will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones
      in wrath to consume it. '
    14: '¹⁴ So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash,
      and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered. It
      will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know
      that I am Yahweh. '
    15: '¹⁵ Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered
      it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘The wall is no more, neither those who
      plastered it; '
    16: "¹⁶ to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and\
      \ who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,’” says the Lord Yahweh.’”\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who
      prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them, '
    18: '¹⁸ and say, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Woe to the women who sew pillows on all
      elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt
      souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves? '
    19: "¹⁹ You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces\
      \ of bread, to kill the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive\
      \ who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I am against your pillows, with
      which you hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms.
      I will let the souls go, even the souls whom you hunt to make them fly. '
    21: '²¹ I will also tear your kerchiefs, and deliver my people out of your hand,

      I am Yahweh. '
    22: '²² Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I
      have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should
      not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive. '
    23: ²³ Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor practice divination.
      I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’”
  14:
    1: '¹ Then some of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me. '
    2: '² Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    3: '³ “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put

    4: '⁴ Therefore speak to them, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Every man

      answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols; '
    5: "⁵ that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are\
      \ all estranged from me through their idols.”’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Return, and\

    7: '⁷ “‘“For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in
      Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and

      to inquire for himself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself. '
    8: "⁸ I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment,\

    12: '¹² Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and
      I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine
      on it, and cut off from it man and animal; '
    14: "¹⁴ though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would\

    15: '¹⁵ “If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it,

    21: '²¹ For the Lord Yahweh says: “How much more when I send my four severe judgments
      on Jerusalem, the sword, the famine, the evil animals, and the pestilence, to
      cut off from it man and animal! '
    22: '²² Yet, behold, there will be left a remnant in it that will be carried out,
      both sons and daughters. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see
      their way and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that
      I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it. '
    23: ²³ They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; then you

      the Lord Yahweh.
  15:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which
      is among the trees of the forest? '
    3: '³ Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to
      hang any vessel on it? '
    4: '⁴ Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its
      ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work? '
    5: "⁵ Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when\
      \ the fire has devoured it, and it has been burned, will it yet be suitable\
      \ for any work?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “As the vine tree among the trees of the
      forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem. '
    7: '⁷ I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the
      fire will devour them. Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face
      against them. '
    8: ⁸ I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,” says
      the Lord Yahweh.
  16:
    1: '¹ Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; '
    3: '³ and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth
      is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite was your father, and your mother
      was a Hittite. '
    4: '⁴ As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You
      weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. You weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped
      in blankets at all. '
    5: "⁵ No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion\
      \ on you; but you were cast out in the open field, because you were abhorred\

    6: '⁶ “‘“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to
      you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘Though you are
      in your blood, live!’ '
    7: "⁷ I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased\
      \ and grew great, and you attained to excellent ornament. Your breasts were\

    8: "⁸ “‘“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the\

      \ Yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord\
      \ Yahweh, “and you became mine. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘“Then I washed you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood

    10: '¹⁰ I clothed you also with embroidered work, and put sealskin sandals on
      you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. '
    11: '¹¹ I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain
      on your neck. '
    12: '¹² I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful
      crown on your head. '
    13: '¹³ Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen,
      silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly
      beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate. '
    14: "¹⁴ Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect,\

      was his. '
    16: '¹⁶ You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked
      with various colors, and played the prostitute on them. This shall not happen,
      neither shall it be. '
    17: '¹⁷ You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which
      I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute
      with them. '
    18: '¹⁸ You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my
      incense before them. '
    19: "¹⁹ My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which\

    20: '²⁰ “‘“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have

      great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger. '
    27: '²⁷ See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished
      your portion, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters

    28: '²⁸ You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were
      insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren’t
      satisfied. '
    29: "²⁹ You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants,\

    35: '³⁵ “Therefore, prostitute, hear Yahweh’s word: '

    27: '²⁷ Her princes within it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood,
      and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain. '
    28: '²⁸ Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions,
      and divining lies to them, saying, ‘The Lord Yahweh says,’ when Yahweh has not
      spoken. '
    29: "²⁹ The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery. Yes,\
      \ they have troubled the poor and needy, and have oppressed the foreigner wrongfully.\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “I sought for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in
      the gap before me for the land, that I would not destroy it; but I found no
      one. '
    31: ³¹ Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them. I have consumed them
      with the fire of my wrath. I have brought their own way on their heads,” says
      the Lord Yahweh.
  23:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. '
    3: '³ They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their
      youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed
      there. '
    4: "⁴ Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became\
      \ mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah,\
      \ and Jerusalem Oholibah. \n"
    5: '⁵ “Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers,
      on the Assyrians her neighbors, '
    6: '⁶ who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable
      young men, horsemen riding on horses. '
    7: '⁷ She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of
      Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols of whoever she lusted after. '
    8: "⁸ She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they\
      \ lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples; and they poured out their\
      \ prostitution on her. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of
      the Assyrians, on whom she doted. '
    10: "¹⁰ These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters; and\
      \ they killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women; for they\
      \ executed judgments on her. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting
      than she, and in her prostitution which was more depraved than the prostitution
      of her sister. '
    12: '¹² She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed
      most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. '
    13: "¹³ I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall,
      the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red, '
    15: '¹⁵ dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads,
      all of them looking like princes, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea,
      the land of their birth. '
    16: '¹⁶ As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to
      them into Chaldea. '
    17: '¹⁷ The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her
      with their prostitution. She was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated
      from them. '
    18: '¹⁸ So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my
      soul was alienated from her, just like my soul was alienated from her sister. '
    19: '¹⁹ Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth,
      in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys,
      and whose issue is like the issue of horses. '
    21: "²¹ Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing\
      \ of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your youthful breasts. \n"
    22: '²² “Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your
      lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them
      against you on every side: '
    23: '²³ the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians
      with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, princes and
      men of renown, all of them riding on horses. '
    24: '²⁴ They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with
      a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you with buckler, shield,
      and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge
      you according to their judgments. '
    25: '²⁵ I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury.
      They will take away your nose and your ears. Your remnant will fall by the sword.
      They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured
      by the fire. '
    26: '²⁶ They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful
      jewels. '
    27: "²⁷ Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution\
      \ from the land of Egypt; so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor\
      \ remember Egypt any more.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of
      them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated. '
    29: '²⁹ They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor,
      and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your prostitution will be
      uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution. '
    30: '³⁰ These things will be done to you, because you have played the prostitute
      after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols. '
    31: "³¹ You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup\
      \ into your hand.’ \n"
    32: "³² “The Lord Yahweh says:\n‘You will drink of your sister’s cup,\n    which\
      \ is deep and large.\nYou will be ridiculed and held in derision.\n    It contains\
      \ much.\n"
    33: "³³ You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,\n    with the cup of astonishment\
      \ and desolation,\n    with the cup of your sister Samaria.\n"
    34: "³⁴ You will even drink it and drain it out.\n    You will gnaw the broken\
      \ pieces of it,\n    and will tear your breasts;\nfor I have spoken it,’ says\
      \ the Lord Yahweh. \n"
    35: "³⁵ “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you have forgotten me, and cast\
      \ me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’”\
      \ \n"
    36: '³⁶ Yahweh said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah?
      Then declare to them their abominations. '
    37: '³⁷ For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have
      committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom
      they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured. '
    38: '³⁸ Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in
      the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths. '
    39: "³⁹ For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came\
      \ the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this\
      \ in the middle of my house. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to
      whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself,
      painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments, '
    41: "⁴¹ and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you\
      \ set my incense and my oil. \n"
    42: '⁴² “The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the
      common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets
      on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads. '
    43: '⁴³ Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the
      prostitute with her, and she with them.’ '
    44: '⁴⁴ They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to
      Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. '
    45: "⁴⁵ Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with\
      \ the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood\
      \ is in their hands. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will
      give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed. '
    47: "⁴⁷ The company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their\
      \ swords. They will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses\
      \ with fire. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ “‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women
      may be taught not to be lewd like you. '
    49: ⁴⁹ They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of
      your idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’”
  24:
    1: '¹ Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month,
      Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon
      drew close to Jerusalem this same day. '
    3: "³ Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh\
      \ says,\n“Put the cauldron on the fire.\n    Put it on,\n    and also pour water\
      \ into it.\n"
    4: "⁴ Gather its pieces into it,\n    even every good piece:\n    the thigh and\
      \ the shoulder.\n    Fill it with the choice bones.\n"
    5: "⁵ Take the choice of the flock,\n    and also a pile of wood for the bones\
      \ under the cauldron.\nMake it boil well.\n    Yes, let its bones be boiled\
      \ within it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:\n“Woe to the bloody city,\n    to the\
      \ cauldron whose rust is in it,\n    and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it!\n\
      Take out of it piece after piece.\n    No lot is fallen on it. \n"
    7: "⁷ “‘“For her blood is in the middle of her.\n    She set it on the bare rock.\n\
      She didn’t pour it on the ground,\n    to cover it with dust.\n"
    8: "⁸ That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,\n    I have set her\
      \ blood on the bare rock,\n    that it should not be covered.” \n"
    9: "⁹ “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:\n“Woe to the bloody city!\n    I also\
      \ will make the pile great.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Heap on the wood.\n    Make the fire hot.\nBoil the meat well.\n    Make\
      \ the broth thick,\n    and let the bones be burned.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then set it empty on its coals,\n    that it may be hot,\nand its bronze\
      \ may burn,\n    and that its filthiness may be molten in it,\n    that its\
      \ rust may be consumed.\n"
    12: "¹² She is weary with toil;\n    yet her great rust,\n    rust by fire, doesn’t\
      \ leave her. \n"
    13: "¹³ “‘“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you\

      \ I have caused my wrath toward you to rest. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I, Yahweh, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go\
      \ back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways, and according\
      \ to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes
      with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears
      run down. '
    17: "¹⁷ Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress\
      \ on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t\
      \ eat mourner’s bread.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died.\
      \ So I did in the morning as I was commanded. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things are to us, that\
      \ you do so?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then I said to them, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    21: '²¹ ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will
      profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and
      that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have
      left behind will fall by the sword. '
    22: '²² You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s
      bread. '
    23: '²³ Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You
      won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one
      toward another. '
    24: "²⁴ Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done,\
      \ you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’”’”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their
      strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon
      they set their heart, their sons and their daughters, '
    26: '²⁶ that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear
      it with your ears? '
    27: ²⁷ In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will
      speak, and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know
      that I am Yahweh.”
  25:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against
      them. '
    3: '³ Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord
      Yahweh says, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against my sanctuary, when it was profaned;

    4: '⁴ therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a
      possession. They will set their encampments in you, and make their dwellings
      in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk. '
    5: '⁵ I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a resting
      place for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” '
    6: '⁶ For the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have clapped your hands, stamped
      with the feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt of your soul against the land

    8: '⁸ “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of

    10: '¹⁰ to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and

    17: '¹⁷ Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s

  33:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When
      I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among
      them, and set him for their watchman; '
    3: '³ if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns
      the people; '
    4: '⁴ then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t heed the warning,
      if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. '
    5: '⁵ He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning. His blood will
      be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his
      soul. '
    6: "⁶ But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and\
      \ the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among\
      \ them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the\
      \ watchman’s hand.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “So you, son of man: I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore
      hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me. '
    8: '⁸ When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t
      speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man will die in his iniquity,
      but I will require his blood at your hand. '
    9: "⁹ Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he\
      \ doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered\
      \ your soul. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions
      and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?”’ '
    11: "¹¹ Tell them, ‘“As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I have no pleasure in\
      \ the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn,\
      \ turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, house of Israel?”’ \n"
    12: '¹² “You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness

      by it in the day that he sins. '
    13: '¹³ When I tell the righteous that he will surely live; if he trusts in his
      righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered;
      but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed. '
    14: '¹⁴ Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die;” if he turns from
      his sin, and does that which is lawful and right; '
    15: '¹⁵ if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by
      robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he will surely
      live. He will not die. '
    16: "¹⁶ None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him.\

    21: '²¹ In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth

    23: '²³ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Son of man, those who inhabit the waste places in the land of Israel
      speak, saying, ‘Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many.
      The land is given us for inheritance.’ '
    25: '²⁵ Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You eat with the blood, and
      lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. So should you possess the land? '
    26: "²⁶ You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles\
      \ his neighbor’s wife. So should you possess the land?”’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “You shall tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “As I live, surely those

      the open field to the animals to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds
      and in the caves will die of the pestilence. '
    28: '²⁸ I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. The pride of her
      power will cease. The mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will
      pass through. '
    29: "²⁹ Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation\
      \ and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by
      the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak to one another, everyone
      to his brother, saying, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes out
      from Yahweh.’ '
    31: '³¹ They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people,
      and they hear your words, but don’t do them; for with their mouth they show
      much love, but their heart goes after their gain. '
    32: "³² Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant\
      \ voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they\
      \ don’t do them. \n"
    33: ³³ “When this comes to pass—behold, it comes—then they will know that a prophet
      has been among them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell
      them, even the shepherds, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel
      who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed the sheep? '
    3: '³ You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fatlings,
      but you don’t feed the sheep. '
    4: '⁴ You haven’t strengthened the diseased. You haven’t healed that which was
      sick. You haven’t bound up that which was broken. You haven’t brought back that
      which was driven away. You haven’t sought that which was lost, but you have
      ruled over them with force and with rigor. '
    5: '⁵ They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. They became food to
      all the animals of the field, and were scattered. '
    6: "⁶ My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill. Yes,\
      \ my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth. There was no one\

    7: '⁷ “‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: '
    8: '⁸ “As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “surely because my sheep became a prey,

      no shepherd, and my shepherds didn’t search for my sheep, but the shepherds
      fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep.” '
    9: '⁹ Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: '
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require\
      \ my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. The\
      \ shepherds won’t feed themselves any more. I will deliver my sheep from their\
      \ mouth, that they may not be food for them.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for
      my sheep, and will seek them out. '
    12: '¹² As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep
      that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep. I will deliver them
      out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries,
      and will bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of
      Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will feed them with good pasture; and their fold will be on the mountains
      of the height of Israel. There they will lie down in a good fold. They will
      feed on fat pasture on the mountains of Israel. '
    15: '¹⁵ I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie
      down,” says the Lord Yahweh. '
    16: "¹⁶ “I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven\

      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “As for you, O my flock, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I judge between
      sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats. '
    18: '¹⁸ Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but
      you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? And to have
      drunk of the clear waters, but must you foul the residue with your feet? '
    19: "¹⁹ As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet,\
      \ and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.’ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge

      with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad; '
    22: '²² therefore I will save my flock, and they will no more be a prey. I will
      judge between sheep and sheep. '
    23: '²³ I will set up one shepherd over them, and he will feed them, even my servant
      David. He will feed them, and he will be their shepherd. '
    24: "²⁴ I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them.\

    25: '²⁵ “‘I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil animals
      to cease out of the land. They will dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep
      in the woods. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing. I will cause
      the shower to come down in its season. There will be showers of blessing. '
    27: '²⁷ The tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its
      increase, and they will be secure in their land. Then they will know that I

      out of the hand of those who made slaves of them. '
    28: '²⁸ They will no more be a prey to the nations, neither will the animals of
      the earth devour them; but they will dwell securely, and no one will make them
      afraid. '
    29: '²⁹ I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they will no more
      be consumed with famine in the land, and not bear the shame of the nations any
      more. '
    30: '³⁰ They will know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them, and that they,

    7: '⁷ Thus I will make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation. I will cut
      off from it him who passes through and him who returns. '
    8: '⁸ I will fill its mountains with its slain. The slain with the sword will

      and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you. '
    30: "³⁰ I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that\
      \ you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations. \n"
    31: '³¹ “‘“Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not
      good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and
      for your abominations. '
    32: "³² I don’t do this for your sake,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Let it be known\
      \ to you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, house of Israel.” \n"
    33: '³³ “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities,
      I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places will be built. '
    34: '³⁴ The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation
      in the sight of all who passed by. '
    35: '³⁵ They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden
      of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’ '
    36: "³⁶ Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have\

    37: '³⁷ “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by

      feasts, so the waste cities will be filled with flocks of men. Then they will
      know that I am Yahweh.’”
  37:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in Yahweh’s Spirit, and set
      me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. '
    2: '² He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many
      in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry. '
    3: "³ He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”\nI answered, “Lord Yahweh,\
      \ you know.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Again he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry
      bones, hear Yahweh’s word. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord Yahweh says to these bones: “Behold, I will cause breath to enter
      into you, and you will live. '
    6: "⁶ I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you\
      \ with skin, and put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that\
      \ I am Yahweh.”’” \n"
    7: '⁷ So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise,
      and behold, there was an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its
      bone. '
    8: "⁸ I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin\
      \ covered them above; but there was no breath in them. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell\
      \ the wind, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe\
      \ on these slain, that they may live.”’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and\
      \ they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
      Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely
      cut off.’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will
      open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and
      I will bring you into the land of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused
      you to come up out of your graves, my people. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. Then I will place you\
      \ in your own land; and you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed\
      \ it,” says Yahweh.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for
      the children of Israel his companions.’ Then take another stick, and write on
      it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Then join them for yourself to one another into one stick, that they may\
      \ become one in your hand. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “When the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show
      us what you mean by these?’ '
    19: '¹⁹ tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph,

    20: '²⁰ The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.”’ '
    21: '²¹ Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the children

    22: '²² I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One
      king will be king to them all. They will no longer be two nations. They won’t
      be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. '
    23: "²³ They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their\
      \ detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them\
      \ out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse\
      \ them. So they will be my people, and I will be their God. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “‘“My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd.
      They will also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them. '
    25: '²⁵ They will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in
      which your fathers lived. They will dwell therein, they, and their children,

      the side of the east gate faced toward the north. '
    45: '⁴⁵ He said to me, “This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests,
      the keepers of the duty of the house. '
    46: '⁴⁶ The room which faces toward the north is for the priests, the keepers
      of the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons
      of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.” '
    47: "⁴⁷ He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide,\
      \ square. The altar was before the house. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of
      the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width
      of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. '
    49: ⁴⁹ The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits;
      even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts,
      one on this side, and another on that side.
  41:
    1: '¹ He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on
      the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of
      the tent. '
    2: "² The width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance\
      \ were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. He measured\
      \ its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits. \n"
    3: '³ Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits;
      and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. '
    4: "⁴ He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before\
      \ the temple. He said to me, “This is the most holy place.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every
      side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side. '
    6: '⁶ The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order.
      They entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all
      around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house. '
    7: "⁷ The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower\
      \ at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and\
      \ so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations
      of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits. '
    9: '⁹ The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside,
      was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged
      to the house. '
    10: '¹⁰ Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every
      side. '
    11: "¹¹ The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one\
      \ door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the\
      \ open area was five cubits all around. \n"
    12: "¹² The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the\
      \ west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits\
      \ thick all around, and its length ninety cubits. \n"
    13: '¹³ So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place,
      and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long; '
    14: "¹⁴ also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward\
      \ the east, one hundred cubits. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ He measured the length of the building before the separate place which
      was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one
      hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court '
    16: '¹⁶ the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their
      three stories, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from
      the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered), '
    17: '¹⁷ to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and
      by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure. '
    18: '¹⁸ It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub
      and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; '
    19: '¹⁹ so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side,
      and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was
      made like this through all the house all around. '
    20: "²⁰ Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The\
      \ wall of the temple was like this. \n"
    21: '²¹ As for the temple, the door posts were squared. As for the face of the
      sanctuary, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple. '
    22: '²² The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its
      corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the
      table that is before Yahweh.” '
    23: '²³ The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. '
    24: '²⁴ The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door,
      and two leaves for the other. '
    25: '²⁵ There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm
      trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face
      of the porch outside. '
    26: ²⁶ There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other
      side, on the sides of the porch. This is how the side rooms of the house and
      the thresholds were arranged.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north. Then
      he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which
      was opposite the building toward the north. '
    2: '² Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the width
      was fifty cubits. '
    3: '³ Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite
      the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery
      in the third floor. '
    4: '⁴ Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit;
      and their doors were toward the north. '
    5: '⁵ Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these,
      more than from the lower and the middle, in the building. '
    6: '⁶ For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars
      of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and
      the middle from the ground. '
    7: '⁷ The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court
      before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits. '
    8: '⁸ For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits.
      Behold, before the temple were one hundred cubits. '
    9: "⁹ From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into\
      \ them from the outer court. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the
      separate place, and before the building, there were rooms. '
    11: '¹¹ The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward
      the north; according to their length so was their width: and all their exits
      were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. '
    12: "¹² According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door\
      \ at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east,\
      \ as one enters into them. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before
      the separate place, are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to Yahweh
      shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, with
      the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place
      is holy. '
    14: "¹⁴ When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place\
      \ into the outer court, but they shall lay their garments in which they minister\
      \ there; for they are holy. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall\
      \ approach that which is for the people.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out
      by the way of the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it all around. '
    16: '¹⁶ He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds,
      with the measuring reed all around. '
    17: '¹⁷ He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed
      all around. '
    18: '¹⁸ He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. '
    19: '¹⁹ He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with
      the measuring reed. '
    20: ²⁰ He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five
      hundred, and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which
      was holy and that which was common.
  43:
    1: '¹ Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the
      east. '
    2: '² Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His
      voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated with
      his glory. '
    3: '³ It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according
      to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were
      like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. '
    4: '⁴ Yahweh’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward
      the east. '
    5: "⁵ The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold,\
      \ Yahweh’s glory filled the house. \n"
    6: '⁶ I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me. '
    7: '⁷ He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place
      of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the children of Israel forever.
      The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their
      kings, by their prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their
      high places; '
    8: '⁸ in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post
      beside my door post. There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled
      my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have
      consumed them in my anger. '
    9: "⁹ Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings,\
      \ far from me. Then I will dwell among them forever. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may
      be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. '
    11: "¹¹ If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the\
      \ form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits, and its entrances, and\
      \ all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws;\
      \ and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and\
      \ all its ordinances, and do them. \n"
    12: "¹² “This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit\
      \ around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. \n"
    13: '¹³ “These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit
      and a hand width): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its
      border around its edge a span; and this shall be the base of the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits,
      and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall
      be four cubits, and the width a cubit. '
    15: '¹⁵ The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward
      there shall be four horns. '
    16: '¹⁶ The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in
      its four sides. '
    17: "¹⁷ The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides;\
      \ and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit\
      \ around; and its steps shall look toward the east.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘These are the ordinances
      of the altar in the day when they make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and
      to sprinkle blood on it. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall give to the Levitical priests who are of the offspring of Zadok,
      who are near to me, to minister to me,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘a young bull
      for a sin offering. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall take of its blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the
      four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around. You shall cleanse it
      and make atonement for it that way. '
    21: "²¹ You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned\
      \ in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary. \n"
    22: '²² “On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin
      offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull. '
    23: '²³ When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without
      defect, and a ram out of the flock without defect. '
    24: "²⁴ You shall bring them near to Yahweh, and the priests shall cast salt on\
      \ them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Yahweh. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering. They
      shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without defect. '
    26: '²⁶ Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall
      they consecrate it. '
    27: ²⁷ When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day,
      and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your
      peace offerings. Then I will accept you,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
  44:
    1: '¹ Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which
      looks toward the east; and it was shut. '
    2: '² Yahweh said to me, “This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, no
      man shall enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it.
      Therefore it shall be shut. '
    3: "³ As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before Yahweh.\
      \ He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out the same\
      \ way.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I\
      \ looked, and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house; so I fell on my\
      \ face. \n"
    5: '⁵ Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear
      with your ears all that I tell you concerning all the ordinances of Yahweh’s
      house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every
      exit of the sanctuary. '
    6: '⁶ You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh
      says: “You house of Israel, let that be enough of all your abominations, '
    7: '⁷ in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised
      in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer
      my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to
      all your abominations. '
    8: '⁸ You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers
      of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.” '
    9: "⁹ The Lord Yahweh says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised\
      \ in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the\
      \ children of Israel. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘“But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who
      went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity. '
    11: '¹¹ Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates
      of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering
      and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister
      to them. '
    12: '¹² Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling
      block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up my hand
      against them,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and they will bear their iniquity. '
    13: '¹³ They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me,
      nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy;
      but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. '
    14: "¹⁴ Yet I will make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its\

      on their waists. They shall not clothe themselves with anything that makes them
      sweat. '
    19: "¹⁹ When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the\

    22: '²² They shall not take for their wives a widow, or her who is put away; but
      they shall take virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow
      who is the widow of a priest. '

      of the land a bull for a sin offering. '
    23: '²³ The seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Yahweh,
      seven bulls and seven rams without defect daily the seven days; and a male goat
      daily for a sin offering. '
    24: "²⁴ He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for\
      \ a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah. \n"
    25: ²⁵ “‘“In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast,
      he shall do like that for seven days; according to the sin offering, according
      to the burnt offering, and according to the meal offering, and according to
      the oil.”
  46:
    1: '¹ “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “The gate of the inner court that looks toward the
      east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath day it shall be
      opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. '
    2: '² The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and
      shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt
      offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the
      gate. Then he shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. '
    3: '³ The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh
      on the Sabbaths and on the new moons. '
    4: '⁴ The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh shall be on the
      Sabbath day six lambs without defect and a ram without defect; '
    5: '⁵ and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering
      for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. '
    6: '⁶ On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without defect, and
      six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without defect. '
    7: '⁷ He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for
      the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. '
    8: "⁸ When the prince enters, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate,\
      \ and he shall go out by its way. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘“But when the people of the land come before Yahweh in the appointed feasts,
      he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way
      of the south gate; and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go out
      by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate by
      which he came in, but shall go out straight before him. '
    10: "¹⁰ The prince shall go in with them when they go in. When they go out, he\

    11: '¹¹ “‘“In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an

    12: "¹² When the prince prepares a free will offering, a burnt offering or peace\

    13: '¹³ “‘“You shall prepare a lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering

    18: "¹⁸ Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust\

      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate,
      into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked toward the north. Behold,
      there was a place on the back part westward. '
    20: "²⁰ He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass\
      \ offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the meal offering;\
      \ that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ Then he brought me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by
      the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there
      was a court. '
    22: '²² In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty cubits
      long and thirty wide. These four in the corners were the same size. '
    23: '²³ There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were
      made under the walls all around. '
    24: ²⁴ Then he said to me, “These are the boiling houses, where the ministers
      of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.”
  47:
    1: '¹ He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters flowed out
      from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house faced
      toward the east. The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of
      the house, on the south of the altar. '
    2: "² Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around\
      \ by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward\
      \ the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side. \n"
    3: '³ When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one
      thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were
      to the ankles. '
    4: '⁴ Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters,
      waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me
      to pass through waters that were to the waist. '
    5: "⁵ Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not\
      \ pass through; for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could\
      \ not be walked through. \n"
    6: "⁶ He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen?”\nThen he brought me, and caused\
      \ me to return to the bank of the river. "
    7: '⁷ Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many
      trees on the one side and on the other. '
    8: '⁸ Then he said to me, “These waters flow out toward the eastern region, and
      will go down into the Arabah. Then they will go toward the sea; and flow into
      the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed. '
    9: '⁹ It will happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place
      where the rivers come, will live. Then there will be a very great multitude
      of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea will be
      healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes. '
    10: '¹⁰ It will happen, that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to
      En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be after
      their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many. '
    11: '¹¹ But the miry places of it, and its marshes, will not be healed. They will
      be given up to salt. '
    12: "¹² By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every\
      \ tree for food, whose leaf won’t wither, neither will its fruit fail. It will\
      \ produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary.\
      \ Its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.” \n"
    13: '¹³ The Lord Yahweh says: “This shall be the border, by which you shall divide
      the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall
      have two portions. '
    14: "¹⁴ You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to\
      \ your fathers. This land will fall to you for inheritance. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “This shall be the border of the land:\n“On the north side, from the great\

      the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. '
    17: "¹⁷ The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus;\

      Israel. '
    22: '²² It will happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to
      you and to the aliens who live among you, who will father children among you.
      Then they shall be to you as the native-born among the children of Israel. They
      shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. '
