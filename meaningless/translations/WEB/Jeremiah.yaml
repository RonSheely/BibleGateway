Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in
      Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. '
    2: '² Yahweh’s word came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of
      Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. '
    3: '³ It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. '
    4: "⁴ Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, \n"
    5: "⁵ “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.\n    Before you were born,\
      \ I sanctified you.\n    I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Behold, I don’t know how to speak; for I\
      \ am a child.” \n"
    7: '⁷ But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever
      I send you, and you must say whatever I command you. '
    8: "⁸ Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says\
      \ Yahweh. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said
      to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. '
    10: "¹⁰ Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to\
      \ uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”\n\
      I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word\
      \ to perform it.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”\n\
      I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all
      the inhabitants of the land. '
    15: "¹⁵ For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,”\
      \ says Yahweh.\n“They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance\
      \ of the gates of Jerusalem,\n    and against all its walls all around, and\
      \ against all the cities of Judah.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,\n\
      \    in that they have forsaken me,\n    and have burned incense to other gods,\n\
      \    and worshiped the works of their own hands. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all
      that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them. '
    18: '¹⁸ For, behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and
      bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its
      princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. '
    19: ¹⁹ They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for
      I am with you”, says Yahweh, “to rescue you.”
  2:
    1: '¹ Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says,\n“I remember\
      \ for you the kindness of your youth,\n    the love of your weddings;\nhow you\
      \ went after me in the wilderness,\n    in a land that was not sown.\n"
    3: "³ Israel was holiness to Yahweh,\n    the first fruits of his increase.\n\
      All who devour him will be held guilty.\n    Evil will come on them,”’ says\
      \ Yahweh.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house
      of Israel! '
    5: "⁵ Yahweh says,\n“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,\n   \
      \ that they have gone far from me,\nand have walked after worthless vanity,\n\
      \    and have become worthless?\n"
    6: "⁶ They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,\n\
      \    who led us through the wilderness,\n    through a land of deserts and of\
      \ pits,\n    through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,\n    through\
      \ a land that no one passed through,\n    and where no man lived?’\n"
    7: "⁷ I brought you into a plentiful land\n    to eat its fruit and its goodness;\n\
      but when you entered, you defiled my land,\n    and made my heritage an abomination.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’\n    and those who handle the\
      \ law didn’t know me.\nThe rulers also transgressed against me,\n    and the\
      \ prophets prophesied by Baal\n    and followed things that do not profit.\n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh,\n    “and I will contend\
      \ with your children’s children.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see.\n    Send to Kedar, and\
      \ consider diligently,\n    and see if there has been such a thing.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has a nation changed its gods,\n    which really are no gods?\n    But\
      \ my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit.\n"
    12: "¹² “Be astonished, you heavens, at this\n    and be horribly afraid.\n  \
      \  Be very desolate,” says Yahweh.\n"
    13: "¹³ “For my people have committed two evils:\n    they have forsaken me, the\
      \ spring of living waters,\n    and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken\
      \ cisterns that can’t hold water.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Is Israel a slave?\n    Is he born into slavery?\n    Why has he become\
      \ a captive?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The young lions have roared at him and yelled.\n    They have made his\
      \ land waste.\n    His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.\n"
    16: "¹⁶     The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of\
      \ your head.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Haven’t you brought this on yourself,\n    in that you have forsaken\
      \ Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?\n\
      \    Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Your own wickedness will correct you,\n    and your backsliding will\
      \ rebuke you.\nKnow therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,\n\
      \    that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,\n    and that my fear is not in\
      \ you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.\n"
    20: "²⁰ “For long ago I broke off your yoke,\n    and burst your bonds.\nYou said,\
      \ ‘I will not serve;’\n    for on every high hill and under every green tree\
      \ you bowed yourself,\n    playing the prostitute.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet I had planted you a noble vine,\n    a pure and faithful seed.\n \
      \   How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine\
      \ to me?\n"
    22: "²² For though you wash yourself with lye,\n    and use much soap,\n    yet\
      \ your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh.\n"
    23: "²³ “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled.\n    I have not gone after the Baals’?\n\
      See your way in the valley.\n    Know what you have done.\nYou are a swift dromedary\
      \ traversing her ways, "
    24: "²⁴ a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving.\n\
      \    When she is in heat, who can turn her away?\n    All those who seek her\
      \ will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.\n"
    25: "²⁵ “Keep your feet from being bare,\n    and your throat from thirst.\nBut\
      \ you said, ‘It is in vain.\n    No, for I have loved strangers,\n    and I\
      \ will go after them.’\n"
    26: "²⁶ As the thief is ashamed when he is found,\n    so the house of Israel\
      \ is ashamed:\n    they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their\
      \ prophets,\n"
    27: "²⁷ who tell wood, ‘You are my father,’\n    and a stone, ‘You have given\
      \ birth to me,’\nfor they have turned their back to me,\n    and not their face;\n\
      \    but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ “But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?\n    Let them\
      \ arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble;\n    for you have\
      \ as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.\n"
    29: "²⁹ “Why will you contend with me?\n    You all have transgressed against\
      \ me,” says Yahweh.\n"
    30: "³⁰ “I have struck your children in vain.\n    They received no correction.\n\
      Your own sword has devoured your prophets,\n    like a destroying lion.\n"
    31: "³¹ Generation, consider Yahweh’s word.\n    Have I been a wilderness to Israel?\n\
      \    Or a land of thick darkness?\nWhy do my people say, ‘We have broken loose.\n\
      \    We will come to you no more’?\n"
    32: "³² “Can a virgin forget her ornaments,\n    or a bride her attire?\n    Yet\
      \ my people have forgotten me for days without number.\n"
    33: "³³ How well you prepare your way to seek love!\n    Therefore you have even\
      \ taught the wicked women your ways.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts.\n\
      \    You didn’t find them breaking in,\n    but it is because of all these things.\n"
    35: "³⁵ “Yet you said, ‘I am innocent.\n    Surely his anger has turned away from\
      \ me.’\n“Behold, I will judge you,\n    because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ Why do you go about so much to change your ways?\n    You will be ashamed\
      \ of Egypt also,\n    as you were ashamed of Assyria.\n"
    37: "³⁷ You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;\n    for\
      \ Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,\n    and you won’t prosper with\
      \ them."
  3:
    1: "¹ “They say, ‘If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes\
      \ another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly\
      \ polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return\
      \ again to me,” says Yahweh. \n"
    2: '² “Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been
      lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness.
      You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness. '
    3: '³ Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain;
      yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead and you refused to be ashamed. '
    4: "⁴ Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of\
      \ my youth!’? \n"
    5: "⁵ “‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold,\
      \ you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen
      that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain
      and under every green tree, and has played the prostitute there. '
    7: '⁷ I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but
      she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. '
    8: '⁸ I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery,
      I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet treacherous Judah,
      her sister, had no fear; but she also went and played the prostitute. '
    9: '⁹ Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she
      committed adultery with stones and with wood. '
    10: "¹⁰ Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me\
      \ with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” says Yahweh. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Yahweh said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous
      than treacherous Judah. '
    12: '¹² Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding
      Israel,’ says Yahweh; ‘I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful,’
      says Yahweh. ‘I will not keep anger forever. '
    13: '¹³ Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh
      your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree,
      and you have not obeyed my voice,’ says Yahweh.” '
    14: '¹⁴ “Return, backsliding children,” says Yahweh; “for I am a husband to you.
      I will take one of you from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring
      you to Zion. '
    15: '¹⁵ I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with
      knowledge and understanding. '
    16: '¹⁶ It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land,
      in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s
      covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss
      it, nor will another be made. '
    17: '¹⁷ At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations
      will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer
      walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart. '
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and\
      \ they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave\
      \ for an inheritance to your fathers. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you\
      \ a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said,\
      \ ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have
      dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh. '
    21: '²¹ A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of
      the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten
      Yahweh their God. '
    22: "²² Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding.\n\
      “Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God. "
    23: '²³ Truly help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains, is in vain. Truly
      the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God. '
    24: '²⁴ But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our
      youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. '
    25: ²⁵ Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have
      sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this
      day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice.”
  4:
    1: '¹ “If you will return, Israel,” says Yahweh, “if you will return to me, and
      if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you will not be
      removed; '
    2: "² and you will swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness.\
      \ The nations will bless themselves in him, and they will glory in him.” \n"
    3: '³ For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow
      ground, and don’t sow among thorns. '
    4: '⁴ Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart,
      you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire,
      and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. '
    5: '⁵ Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in
      the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let’s go into the fortified
      cities!’ '
    6: "⁶ Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring\
      \ evil from the north, and a great destruction.” \n"
    7: '⁷ A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on
      his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your
      cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. '
    8: '⁸ For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce
      anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us. '
    9: "⁹ “It will happen at that day,” says Yahweh, “that the heart of the king will\
      \ perish, along with the heart of the princes. The priests will be astonished,\
      \ and the prophets will wonder.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people\
      \ and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to\
      \ the heart.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind
      from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not
      to winnow, nor to cleanse; '
    12: "¹² a full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments\
      \ against them.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind.
      His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined. '
    14: '¹⁴ Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How
      long will your evil thoughts lodge within you? '
    15: '¹⁵ For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim: '
    16: '¹⁶ “Tell the nations, behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from
      a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah. '
    17: '¹⁷ As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has
      been rebellious against me,’” says Yahweh. '
    18: "¹⁸ “Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your\
      \ wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles
      within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound
      of the trumpet, the alarm of war. '
    20: '²⁰ Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste.
      Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment. '
    21: "²¹ How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet? \n"
    22: '²² “For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children,
      and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t
      know how to do good.” '
    23: '²³ I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void, and the heavens,
      and they had no light. '
    24: '²⁴ I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved
      back and forth. '
    25: '²⁵ I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had
      fled. '
    26: '²⁶ I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities
      were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, before his fierce anger. '
    27: '²⁷ For Yahweh says, “The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not
      make a full end. '
    28: "²⁸ For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black, because\
      \ I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will\
      \ I turn back from it.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into
      the thickets, and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man
      dwells therein. '
    30: '³⁰ You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself
      with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge
      your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise
      you. They seek your life. '
    31: ³¹ For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her
      who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps
      for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints
      before the murderers.”
  5:
    1: '¹ “Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know,
      and seek in its wide places, if you can find a man, if there is anyone who does
      justly, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her. '
    2: "² Though they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ surely they swear falsely.” \n"
    3: "³ O Yahweh, don’t your eyes look on truth? You have stricken them, but they\
      \ were not grieved. You have consumed them, but they have refused to receive\
      \ correction. They have made their faces harder than a rock. They have refused\
      \ to return. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then I said, “Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they don’t know
      Yahweh’s way, nor the law of their God. '
    5: '⁵ I will go to the great men and will speak to them, for they know the way
      of Yahweh, and the law of their God.” But these with one accord have broken
      the yoke, and burst the bonds. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore a lion out of the forest will kill them. A wolf of the evenings\
      \ will destroy them. A leopard will watch against their cities. Everyone who\
      \ goes out there will be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many\
      \ and their backsliding has increased. \n"
    7: '⁷ “How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what
      are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled
      themselves in troops at the prostitutes’ houses. '
    8: '⁸ They were as fed horses roaming at large. Everyone neighed after his neighbor’s
      wife. '
    9: "⁹ Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says Yahweh. “Shouldn’t my soul\
      \ be avenged on such a nation as this? \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don’t make a full end. Take away
      her branches, for they are not Yahweh’s. '
    11: "¹¹ For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously\
      \ against me,” says Yahweh. \n"
    12: '¹² They have denied Yahweh, and said, “It is not he. Evil won’t come on us.
      We won’t see sword or famine. '
    13: "¹³ The prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus it will\
      \ be done to them.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies says, “Because you speak this word,
      behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it
      will devour them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far away, house of Israel,”
      says Yahweh. “It is a mighty nation. It is an ancient nation, a nation whose
      language you don’t know and don’t understand what they say. '
    16: '¹⁶ Their quiver is an open tomb. They are all mighty men. '
    17: "¹⁷ They will eat up your harvest and your bread, which your sons and your\
      \ daughters should eat. They will eat up your flocks and your herds. They will\
      \ eat up your vines and your fig trees. They will beat down your fortified cities\
      \ in which you trust with the sword. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “But even in those days,” says Yahweh, “I will not make a full end of
      you. '
    19: "¹⁹ It will happen when you say, ‘Why has Yahweh our God done all these things\
      \ to us?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Just as you have forsaken me and served\

    18: "¹⁸ Why is my pain perpetual,\n    and my wound incurable,\n    which refuses\
      \ to be healed?\nWill you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook,\n    like waters\
      \ that fail? \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Therefore Yahweh says,\n“If you return, then I will bring you again,\n\
      \    that you may stand before me;\nand if you take out the precious from the\
      \ vile,\n    you will be as my mouth.\nThey will return to you,\n    but you\

    2: '² “You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in

      their fathers who became their father in this land: '
    4: "⁴ “They will die grievous deaths. They will not be lamented, neither will\

    5: '⁵ For Yahweh says, “Don’t enter into the house of mourning. Don’t go to lament.
      Don’t bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people,” says Yahweh,
      “even loving kindness and tender mercies. '
    6: '⁶ Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried. Men
      won’t lament for them, cut themselves, or make themselves bald for them. '
    7: "⁷ Men won’t break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead.\

    8: '⁸ “You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and
      to drink.” '
    9: '⁹ For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I will cause to cease
      out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and

    10: '¹⁰ It will happen, when you tell this people all these words, and they ask
      you, ‘Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us?’ or ‘What is
      our iniquity? or ‘What is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our
      God?’ '
    11: '¹¹ then you shall tell them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says
      Yahweh, ‘and have walked after other gods, have served them, have worshiped

    19: '¹⁹ Yahweh said this to me: “Go and stand in the gate of the children of the

      it in by the gates of Jerusalem. '
    22: '²² Don’t carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day. Don’t do any
      work, but make the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers. '
    23: '²³ But they didn’t listen. They didn’t turn their ear, but made their neck
      stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction. '
    24: '²⁴ It will happen, if you diligently listen to me,” says Yahweh, “to bring
      in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to make
      the Sabbath day holy, to do no work therein; '
    25: '²⁵ then there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting

    27: ²⁷ But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy, and not
      to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day,

  18:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, '
    2: "² “Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to\

  19:
    1: '¹ Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen container, and take some
      of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests; '
    2: '² and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of

    3: '³ Say, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
      Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “Behold, I will bring evil on this

    4: '⁴ Because they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burned
      incense in it to other gods that they didn’t know, they, their fathers, and
      the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents, '
    5: '⁵ and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their children in the fire
      for burnt offerings to Baal, which I didn’t command, nor speak, which didn’t
      even enter into my mind. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no\

    7: '⁷ “‘“I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. I

      birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth. '
    8: '⁸ I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes
      by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. '

    10: '¹⁰ “Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with

    12: '¹² This is what I will do to this place,” says Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants,

  20:
    1: '¹ Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s
      house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. '
    2: '² Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that
      were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house. '
    3: '³ On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah
      said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib. '
    4: '⁴ For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all

    5: '⁵ Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and

    8: "⁸ For as often as I speak, I cry out;\n    I cry, “Violence and destruction!”\n\

    9: "⁹ If I say, I will not make mention of him,\n    or speak any more in his\

    5: '⁵ I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong
      arm, even in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation. '
    6: '⁶ I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal. They will
      die of a great pestilence. '
    7: "⁷ Afterward,” says Yahweh, “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants,\
      \ and the people, even those who are left in this city from the pestilence,\
      \ from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king\
      \ of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those\
      \ who seek their life. He will strike them with the edge of the sword. He will\
      \ not spare them, have pity, or have mercy.”’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “You shall say to this people, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I set before you the
      way of life and the way of death. '
    9: '⁹ He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by
      the pestilence; but he who goes out and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege
      you, he will live, and he will escape with his life. '
    10: "¹⁰ For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good,” says\
      \ Yahweh. “It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will\
      \ burn it with fire.”’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Concerning the house of the king of Judah, hear Yahweh’s word: '
    12: "¹² House of David, Yahweh says,\n‘Execute justice in the morning,\n    and\

      \ of the evil of your doings.\n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,\n    and of the\
      \ rock of the plain,’ says Yahweh.\n‘You that say, “Who would come down against\

  22:

      robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong. Do no violence to the
      foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent blood in this place. '
    4: '⁴ For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will
      enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his
      servants, and his people. '
    5: "⁵ But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that\

    8: '⁸ “Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor,

    9: "⁹ Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their\

    10: "¹⁰ Don’t weep for the dead.\n    Don’t bemoan him;\nbut weep bitterly for\

    11: '¹¹ For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who

    23: "²³ Inhabitant of Lebanon,\n    who makes your nest in the cedars,\nhow greatly\

    21: "²¹ I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.\n    I didn’t speak to them,\

    27: '²⁷ They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which

    33: '³³ “When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What

    34: '³⁴ As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message
      from Yahweh,’ I will even punish that man and his household. '
    35: '³⁵ You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, ‘What

    36: '³⁶ You will mention the message from Yahweh no more: for every man’s own
      word has become his message; for you have perverted the words of the living
      God, of Yahweh of Armies, our God. '
    37: '³⁷ You will say to the prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and, ‘What
      has Yahweh spoken?’ '
    38: '³⁸ Although you say, ‘The message from Yahweh;’ therefore Yahweh says: ‘Because
      you say this word, “The message from Yahweh,” and I have sent to you, telling
      you not to say, “The message from Yahweh;” '
    39: '³⁹ therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off,

      \ have no escape.\n"
    36: "³⁶ A voice of the cry of the shepherds,\n    and the wailing of the leader\
      \ of the flock,\n    for Yahweh destroys their pasture.\n"
    37: "³⁷ The peaceful folds are brought to silence\n    because of the fierce anger\
      \ of Yahweh.\n"
    38: "³⁸ He has left his covert, as the lion;\n    for their land has become an\
      \ astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression,\n    and because\
      \ of his fierce anger."
  26:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      this word came from Yahweh: '
    2: '² “Yahweh says: ‘Stand in the court of Yahweh’s house, and speak to all the
      cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh’s house, all the words that
      I command you to speak to them. Don’t omit a word. '
    3: '³ It may be they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way; that I
      may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of
      their doings.’ '
    4: '⁴ You shall tell them, “Yahweh says: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk
      in my law, which I have set before you, '
    5: '⁵ to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you,
      even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened; '
    6: "⁶ then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse\
      \ to all the nations of the earth.”’” \n"
    7: '⁷ The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking
      these words in Yahweh’s house. '
    8: '⁸ When Jeremiah had finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to
      speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized
      him, saying, “You shall surely die! '
    9: "⁹ Why have you prophesied in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘This house will be like\
      \ Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant?’” All the people\
      \ were crowded around Jeremiah in Yahweh’s house. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s
      house to Yahweh’s house; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s
      house. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the\
      \ people, saying, “This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against\
      \ this city, as you have heard with your ears.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying,
      “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the
      words that you have heard. '
    13: '¹³ Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey Yahweh your God’s
      voice; then Yahweh will relent from the evil that he has pronounced against
      you. '
    14: '¹⁴ But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me what is good and
      right in your eyes. '
    15: "¹⁵ Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent\
      \ blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for in truth Yahweh\
      \ has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets:\
      \ “This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh\
      \ our God.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly
      of the people, saying, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah;\
      \ and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says:\n\
      “‘Zion will be plowed as a field,\n    and Jerusalem will become heaps,\n  \
      \  and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear\
      \ Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster\
      \ which he had pronounced against them? We would commit great evil against our\
      \ own souls that way!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ There was also a man who prophesied in Yahweh’s name, Uriah the son of
      Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against
      this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. '
    21: '²¹ When Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes heard
      his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he
      was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt. '
    22: '²² Then Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor,
      and certain men with him, into Egypt; '
    23: "²³ and they fetched Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the\
      \ king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves\
      \ of the common people. \n"
    24: ²⁴ But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they
      didn’t give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
  27:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, '
    2: '² Yahweh says to me: “Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck. '
    3: '³ Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of
      the children of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the
      hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. '
    4: '⁴ Give them a command to their masters, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God
      of Israel says, “You shall tell your masters: '
    5: '⁵ ‘I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface
      of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm. I give it to whom
      it seems right to me. '
    6: '⁶ Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
      of Babylon, my servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to
      serve him. '
    7: "⁷ All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son’s son, until the time\
      \ of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their\
      \ bondservant. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘“‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will
      not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their
      neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says Yahweh, ‘with the sword, with
      famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. '
    9: '⁹ But as for you, don’t listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your
      dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying,
      “You shall not serve the king of Babylon;” '
    10: '¹⁰ for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, so that
      I would drive you out, and you would perish. '
    11: "¹¹ But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon\
      \ and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says Yahweh;\
      \ ‘and they will till it and dwell in it.’”’” \n"
    12: '¹² I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying,
      “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his
      people, and live. '
    13: '¹³ Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and
      by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not
      serve the king of Babylon? '
    14: '¹⁴ Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You
      shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ For I have not sent them,” says Yahweh, “but they prophesy falsely in\
      \ my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets\
      \ who prophesy to you.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Yahweh says,
      “Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold,
      the vessels of Yahweh’s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon;’
      for they prophesy a lie to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Don’t listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should
      this city become a desolation? '
    18: '¹⁸ But if they are prophets, and if Yahweh’s word is with them, let them
      now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in
      Yahweh’s house, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don’t go
      to Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ For Yahweh of Armies says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea,
      concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in
      this city, '
    20: '²⁰ which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away
      captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon,
      and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; '
    21: '²¹ yes, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the vessels
      that are left in Yahweh’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and
      at Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² ‘They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day
      that I visit them,’ says Yahweh; ‘then I will bring them up, and restore them
      to this place.’”
  28:
    1: '¹ That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
      in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet,
      who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahweh’s house, in the presence of the priests
      and of all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have broken the yoke of the
      king of Babylon. '
    3: '³ Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels
      of Yahweh’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place,
      and carried to Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of\
      \ Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says Yahweh;\
      \ ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of
      the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house, '
    6: '⁶ even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so. May Yahweh perform
      your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh’s
      house, and all those who are captives, from Babylon to this place. '
    7: '⁷ Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the
      ears of all the people: '
    8: '⁸ The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against
      many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence. '
    9: "⁹ The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens,\
      \ then the prophet will be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s
      neck, and broke it. '
    11: "¹¹ Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Yahweh says:\
      \ ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off\
      \ the neck of all the nations within two full years.’” Then the prophet Jeremiah\
      \ went his way. \n"
    12: '¹² Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken
      the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “You have broken the bars
      of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron.” '
    14: "¹⁴ For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “I have put a yoke of iron\
      \ on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king\
      \ of Babylon; and they will serve him. I have also given him the animals of\
      \ the field.”’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah!
      Yahweh has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface\
      \ of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against\
      \ Yahweh.’” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
  29:
    1: '¹ Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from
      Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests,
      to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away
      captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, '
    2: '² (after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of
      Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem), '
    3: "³ by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah,\
      \ (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon).\
      \ It said: \n"
    4: '⁴ Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have
      caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon: '
    5: '⁵ “Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. '
    6: '⁶ Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and
      give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply
      there, and don’t be diminished. '
    7: '⁷ Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive,
      and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.” '
    8: '⁸ For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Don’t let your prophets who
      are among you and your diviners deceive you. Don’t listen to your dreams which
      you cause to be dreamed. '
    9: '⁹ For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says
      Yahweh. '
    10: '¹⁰ For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I
      will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return
      to this place. '
    11: '¹¹ For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts
      of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future. '
    12: '¹² You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen
      to you. '
    13: '¹³ You shall seek me, and find me, when you search for me with all your heart. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will be found by you,” says Yahweh, “and I will turn again your captivity,\
      \ and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where\
      \ I have driven you, says Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where\
      \ I caused you to be carried away captive.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;” '
    16: '¹⁶ Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on David’s throne, and concerning
      all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone with you
      into captivity; '
    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine,
      and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten,
      they are so bad. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the
      pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the
      kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing,
      and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, '
    19: "¹⁹ because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which\
      \ I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them;\
      \ but you would not hear,” says Yahweh. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives, whom I have sent away
      from Jerusalem to Babylon. '
    21: '²¹ Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah,
      and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my
      name: “Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
      and he will kill them before your eyes. '
    22: '²² A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are
      in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king
      of Babylon roasted in the fire;’ '
    23: "²³ because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery\
      \ with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which\
      \ I didn’t command them. I am he who knows, and am witness,” says Yahweh. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying, '
    25: '²⁵ “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you have sent letters
      in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the
      son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that
      there may be officers in Yahweh’s house, for every man who is crazy, and makes
      himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles. '
    27: '²⁷ Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes
      himself a prophet to you, '
    28: "²⁸ because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build\
      \ houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?”’” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. '
    30: '³⁰ Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    31: '³¹ “Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah
      the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him,
      and he has caused you to trust in a lie;” '
    32: ³² therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and
      his offspring. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see
      the good that I will do to my people,” says Yahweh, “because he has spoken rebellion
      against Yahweh.”’”
  30:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, '
    2: '² “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Write all the words that I have spoken
      to you in a book. '
    3: "³ For, behold, the days come,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will reverse the captivity\
      \ of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will cause them to return\
      \ to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’” \n"
    4: '⁴ These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. '
    5: "⁵ For Yahweh says:\n“We have heard a voice of trembling;\n    a voice of fear,\
      \ and not of peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.\n    Why do I see every\
      \ man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,\n    and all faces\
      \ are turned pale?\n"
    7: "⁷ Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it.\n    It is even the\
      \ time of Jacob’s trouble;\n    but he will be saved out of it.\n"
    8: "⁸ It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break\
      \ his yoke from off your neck,\n    and will burst your bonds.\n    Strangers\
      \ will no more make them their bondservants;\n"
    9: "⁹ but they will serve Yahweh their God,\n    and David their king,\n    whom\
      \ I will raise up to them.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh.\n    Don’t\
      \ be dismayed, Israel.\nFor, behold, I will save you from afar,\n    and save\
      \ your offspring from the land of their captivity.\nJacob will return,\n   \
      \ and will be quiet and at ease.\n    No one will make him afraid.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you;\n    for I will make a full\
      \ end of all the nations where I have scattered you,\n    but I will not make\
      \ a full end of you;\nbut I will correct you in measure,\n    and will in no\
      \ way leave you unpunished.” \n"
    12: "¹² For Yahweh says,\n“Your hurt is incurable.\n    Your wound is grievous.\n"
    13: "¹³ There is no one to plead your cause,\n    that you may be bound up.\n\
      \    You have no healing medicines.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your lovers have forgotten you.\n    They don’t seek you.\nFor I have\
      \ wounded you with the wound of an enemy,\n    with the chastisement of a cruel\
      \ one,\nfor the greatness of your iniquity,\n    because your sins were increased.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you cry over your injury?\n    Your pain is incurable.\nFor the\
      \ greatness of your iniquity,\n    because your sins have increased,\n    I\
      \ have done these things to you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.\n    All your adversaries,\
      \ everyone of them, will go into captivity.\nThose who plunder you will be plunder.\n\
      \    I will make all who prey on you become prey.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will restore health to you,\n    and I will heal you of your wounds,”\
      \ says Yahweh;\n“because they have called you an outcast,\n    saying, ‘It is\
      \ Zion, whom no man seeks after.’” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Yahweh says:\n“Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,\n\
      \    and have compassion on his dwelling places.\nThe city will be built on\
      \ its own hill,\n    and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Thanksgiving will proceed out of them\n    with the voice of those who\
      \ make merry.\nI will multiply them,\n    and they will not be few;\nI will\
      \ also glorify them,\n    and they will not be small.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Their children also will be as before,\n    and their congregation will\
      \ be established before me.\n    I will punish all who oppress them.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their prince will be one of them,\n    and their ruler will proceed from\
      \ among them.\nI will cause him to draw near,\n    and he will approach me;\n\
      \    for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?” says Yahweh.\n"
    22: "²² “You shall be my people,\n    and I will be your God.\n"
    23: "²³ Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out,\n    a sweeping storm:\n\
      \    it will burst on the head of the wicked.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return until he has accomplished,\n\
      \    and until he has performed the intentions of his heart.\n    In the latter\
      \ days you will understand it.”"
  31:
    1: "¹ “At that time,” says Yahweh, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel,\
      \ and they will be my people.” \n"
    2: "² Yahweh says, “The people who survive the sword found favor in the wilderness;\
      \ even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.” \n"
    3: "³ Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying,\n“Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting\
      \ love.\n    Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will build you again,\n    and you will be built, O virgin of Israel.\n\
      You will again be adorned with your tambourines,\n    and will go out in the\
      \ dances of those who make merry.\n"
    5: "⁵ Again you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria.\n    The planters\
      \ will plant,\n    and will enjoy its fruit.\n"
    6: "⁶ For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim cry,\n\
      \    ‘Arise! Let’s go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’” \n"
    7: "⁷ For Yahweh says,\n“Sing with gladness for Jacob,\n    and shout for the\
      \ chief of the nations.\nPublish, praise, and say,\n    ‘Yahweh, save your people,\n\
      \    the remnant of Israel!’\n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will bring them from the north country,\n    and gather them from\
      \ the uttermost parts of the earth,\nalong with the blind and the lame,\n  \
      \  the woman with child and her who travails with child together.\n    They\
      \ will return as a great company.\n"
    9: "⁹ They will come with weeping.\n    I will lead them with petitions.\nI will\
      \ cause them to walk by rivers of waters,\n    in a straight way in which they\
      \ won’t stumble;\nfor I am a father to Israel.\n    Ephraim is my firstborn.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations,\n    and declare it in the distant islands.\
      \ Say,\n‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,\n    and keep him, as a shepherd\
      \ does his flock.’\n"
    11: "¹¹ For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob,\n    and redeemed him from the hand of\
      \ him who was stronger than he.\n"
    12: "¹² They will come and sing in the height of Zion,\n    and will flow to the\
      \ goodness of Yahweh,\nto the grain, to the new wine, to the oil,\n    and to\
      \ the young of the flock and of the herd.\nTheir soul will be as a watered garden.\n\
      \    They will not sorrow any more at all.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance;\n    the young men and the\
      \ old together;\nfor I will turn their mourning into joy,\n    and will comfort\
      \ them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,\n    and my people\
      \ will be satisfied with my goodness,” says Yahweh. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Yahweh says:\n“A voice is heard in Ramah,\n    lamentation and bitter\
      \ weeping,\nRachel weeping for her children.\n    She refuses to be comforted\
      \ for her children,\n    because they are no more.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Yahweh says:\n“Refrain your voice from weeping,\n    and your eyes from\
      \ tears;\n    for your work will be rewarded,” says Yahweh.\n    “They will\
      \ come again from the land of the enemy.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There is hope for your latter end,” says Yahweh.\n    “Your children will\
      \ come again to their own territory. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus,\n    ‘You have chastised me,\n\

      \    for you are Yahweh my God.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Surely after that I was turned.\n    I repented.\nAfter that I was instructed.\n\
      \    I struck my thigh.\nI was ashamed, yes, even confounded,\n    because I\
      \ bore the reproach of my youth.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is Ephraim my dear son?\n    Is he a darling child?\nFor as often as I\
      \ speak against him,\n    I still earnestly remember him.\ntherefore my heart\
      \ yearns for him.\n    I will surely have mercy on him,” says Yahweh. \n"
    21: "²¹ “Set up road signs.\n    Make guideposts.\nSet your heart toward the highway,\n\

      \ again to these your cities.\n"
    22: "²² How long will you go here and there,\n    you backsliding daughter?\n\
      For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:\n    a woman will encompass\

    23: '²³ Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Yet again they will use this
      speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I reverse their captivity:
      ‘Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.’ '
    24: '²⁴ Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and

  32:
    1: '¹ This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of
      Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: "² Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah\
      \ the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of\
      \ Judah’s house. \n"
    3: '³ For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy,
      and say, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king
      of Babylon, and he will take it; '
    4: '⁴ and Zedekiah king of Judah won’t escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans,
      but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will
      speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes; '
    5: "⁵ and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit\
      \ him,” says Yahweh: “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not prosper?”’”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Jeremiah said, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, '
    7: "⁷ ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying,\
      \ “Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to\
      \ buy it.”’” \n"
    8: "⁸ “So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according\
      \ to Yahweh’s word, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth,\
      \ which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and\
      \ the redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself.’\n“Then I knew that this was\
      \ Yahweh’s word. "
    9: '⁹ I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed
      him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. '
    10: '¹⁰ I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money
      in the balances to him. '
    11: '¹¹ So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing
      the terms and conditions, and that which was open; '
    12: "¹² and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah,\
      \ the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the\
      \ presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, before all\
      \ the Jews who sat in the court of the guard. \n"
    13: '¹³ “I commanded Baruch before them, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Take these deeds, this deed
      of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in
      an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Houses and fields and vineyards\
      \ will yet again be bought in this land.’ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of\
      \ Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying, \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your
      great power and by your outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You show loving kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers
      into the bosom of their children after them. The great, the mighty God, Yahweh
      of Armies is your name: '
    19: '¹⁹ great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways
      of the children of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according
      to the fruit of his doings; '
    20: '²⁰ who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day,
      both in Israel and among other men; and made yourself a name, as it is today; '
    21: '²¹ and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with
      wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; '
    22: '²² and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them,
      a land flowing with milk and honey. '
    23: "²³ They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t\
      \ walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to\
      \ do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Behold, siege ramps have come to the city to take it. The city is given
      into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of
      the famine, and of the pestilence. What you have spoken has happened. Behold,
      you see it. '
    25: "²⁵ You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, ‘Buy the field for money, and call witnesses;’\
      \ whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard
      for me? '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore Yahweh says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of
      the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will
      take it. '
    29: "²⁹ The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city\
      \ on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense\
      \ to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that
      which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have
      only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh. '
    31: '³¹ For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath
      from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it
      from before my face, '
    32: '³² because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children
      of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger: they, their kings, their
      princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants
      of Jerusalem. '
    33: '³³ They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught
      them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive
      instruction. '
    34: '³⁴ But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name,
      to defile it. '
    35: "³⁵ They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son\
      \ of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to\
      \ Molech, which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that\
      \ they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Now therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning this city, about
      which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword,
      by the famine, and by the pestilence:” '
    37: '³⁷ “Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven
      them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring
      them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely. '
    38: '³⁸ Then they will be my people, and I will be their God. '
    39: '³⁹ I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever,
      for their good, and the good of their children after them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away
      from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that
      they may not depart from me. '
    41: "⁴¹ Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in\
      \ this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.” \n"
    42: '⁴² For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people,
      so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them. '
    43: '⁴³ Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, ‘It is desolate,
      without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ '
    44: ⁴⁴ Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses,
      in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of
      Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and
      in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,”
      says Yahweh.
  33:
    1: '¹ Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still
      locked up in the court of the guard, saying, '
    2: '² “Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it—Yahweh is his name,
      says: '
    3: '³ ‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult
      things, which you don’t know.’ '
    4: '⁴ For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and
      concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a
      defense against the mounds and against the sword; '
    5: '⁵ while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead
      bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose
      wickedness I have hidden my face from this city: '
    6: '⁶ ‘Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will
      reveal to them abundance of peace and truth. '
    7: '⁷ I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return,
      and will build them, as at the first. '
    8: '⁸ I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against
      me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me
      and by which they have transgressed against me. '
    9: "⁹ This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before\
      \ all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them,\
      \ and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide\
      \ to it.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which
      you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of
      Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without
      inhabitant and without animal,’ '
    11: "¹¹ the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom\
      \ and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh\
      \ of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who\
      \ bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of\

    12: '¹² Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is
      waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of
      shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. '
    13: "¹³ In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the\
      \ cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem,\
      \ and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of\
      \ him who counts them,” says Yahweh. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word\
      \ which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house\
      \ of Judah. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “In those days and at that time,\n    I will cause a Branch of righteousness\
      \ to grow up to David.\n    He will execute justice and righteousness in the\

      the house of Israel. '
    18: "¹⁸ The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings,\
      \ to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    20: '²⁰ “Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant
      of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time, '
    21: '²¹ then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t
      have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. '
    22: "²² As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t\
      \ be measured; so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the\
      \ Levites who minister to me.’” \n"
    23: '²³ Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast
      off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they
      should be no more a nation before them.” '
    25: '²⁵ Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed
      the ordinances of heaven and earth; '
    26: '²⁶ then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant,
      so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of
      Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and
      will have mercy on them.”'
  34:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of
      Babylon, with all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his
      dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all
      its cities, saying: '
    2: '² “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah,
      and tell him, Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the
      king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire. '
    3: "³ You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered\
      \ into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he\
      \ will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.”’ \n"
    4: '⁴ “Yet hear Yahweh’s word, O Zedekiah king of Judah: Yahweh says concerning
      you, ‘You won’t die by the sword. '
    5: "⁵ You will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former\
      \ kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you. They will\
      \ lament you, saying, “Ah Lord!” for I have spoken the word,’ says Yahweh.”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah
      in Jerusalem, '
    7: "⁷ when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against\
      \ all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah;\
      \ for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities. \n"
    8: '⁸ The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant
      with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them; '
    9: '⁹ that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant,
      who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should make bondservants
      of them, of a Jew his brother. '
    10: '¹⁰ All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant,
      that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant go
      free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and
      let them go; '
    11: "¹¹ but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,\
      \ whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for\
      \ servants and for handmaids. \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers
      in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
      bondage, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother
      who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You
      shall let him go free from you; but your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t
      incline their ear. '
    15: '¹⁵ You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every
      man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in
      the house which is called by my name; '
    16: "¹⁶ but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant,\
      \ and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to\
      \ return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for\
      \ handmaids.’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore Yahweh says: “You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty,
      every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim
      to you a liberty,” says Yahweh, “to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
      famine. I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the
      earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed
      the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf
      in two and passed between its parts: '
    19: '¹⁹ the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests,
      and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf; '
    20: "²⁰ I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand\
      \ of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds\
      \ of the sky and for the animals of the earth. \n"
    21: '²¹ “I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of
      their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands
      of the king of Babylon’s army, who has gone away from you. '
    22: ²² Behold, I will command,” says Yahweh, “and cause them to return to this
      city. They will fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire. I will make
      the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”
  35:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the
      son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, '
    2: "² “Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into\
      \ Yahweh’s house, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.” \n"
    3: '³ Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with
      his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; '
    4: '⁴ and I brought them into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the sons of Hanan
      the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the room of the princes, which
      was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. '
    5: "⁵ I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine,\
      \ and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!” \n"
    6: '⁶ But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our
      father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your
      sons, forever. '
    7: '⁷ You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but
      all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land
      in which you live as nomads.’ '
    8: '⁸ We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all
      that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons,
      or our daughters; '
    9: '⁹ and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard,
      field, or seed; '
    10: '¹⁰ but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all
      that Jonadab our father commanded us. '
    11: "¹¹ But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said,\
      \ ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for\
      \ fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah
      and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to listen
      to my words?” says Yahweh. '
    14: '¹⁴ “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not
      to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey
      their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking,
      and you have not listened to me. '
    15: '¹⁵ I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early
      and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way,
      amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, then you will
      dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:’ but you have
      not inclined your ear, nor listened to me. '
    16: "¹⁶ The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of\
      \ their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to\
      \ me.”’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold,\
      \ I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil\
      \ that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they\
      \ have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.’” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of Armies, the God
      of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father,
      and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;’ '
    19: '¹⁹ therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab the son
      of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’”'
  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word
      came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, '
    2: '² “Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken
      to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from
      the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. '
    3: "³ It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend\
      \ to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive\
      \ their iniquity and their sin.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the
      mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll
      of a book. '
    5: '⁵ Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into Yahweh’s
      house. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my
      mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast
      day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their
      cities. '
    7: "⁷ It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each\
      \ return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath\
      \ against this people.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet
      commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house. '
    9: '⁹ Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in
      the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from
      the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house,\
      \ in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court,\
      \ at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of
      the book all Yahweh’s words, '
    12: '¹² he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold,
      all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of
      Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah
      the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. '
    13: '¹³ Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch
      read the book in the ears of the people. '
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of\
      \ Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll\
      \ in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.”\nSo Baruch the\
      \ son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them. "
    15: "¹⁵ They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.”\nSo Baruch\
      \ read it in their hearing. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward
      another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” '
    17: "¹⁷ They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words\
      \ at his mouth?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his\
      \ mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let\
      \ anyone know where you are.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll
      in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing
      of the king. '
    21: '²¹ So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room
      of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the
      hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. '
    22: '²² Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month; and there
      was a fire in the brazier burning before him. '
    23: '²³ When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife,
      and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was
      consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. '
    24: '²⁴ The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and
      didn’t tear their garments. '
    25: '²⁵ Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the
      king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. '
    26: "²⁶ The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel,\
      \ and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah\
      \ the prophet; but Yahweh hid them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll,
      and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, '
    28: '²⁸ “Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that
      were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. '
    29: '²⁹ Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have
      burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written therein, saying, ‘The king
      of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease
      from there man and animal?’”’ '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have
      no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to
      the heat, and in the night to the frost. '
    31: "³¹ I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity.\
      \ I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah,\
      \ all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”’”\
      \ \n"
    32: ³² Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the
      son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of
      the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar
      words were added to them.
  37:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of
      Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. '
    2: "² But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to\
      \ Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. \n"
    3: "³ Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son\
      \ of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to Yahweh\
      \ our God for us.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put
      him into prison. '
    5: "⁵ Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging\
      \ Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, '
    7: '⁷ “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who
      sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out
      to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land. '
    8: "⁸ The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take\
      \ it and burn it with fire.”’ \n"
    9: '⁹ “Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely
      depart from us;” for they will not depart. '
    10: "¹⁰ For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against\
      \ you, and only wounded men remained among them, they would each rise up in\
      \ his tent and burn this city with fire.’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of
      Pharaoh’s army, '
    12: '¹² then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to
      receive his portion there, in the middle of the people. '
    13: "¹³ When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose\
      \ name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.”\n\
      But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the\
      \ princes. "
    15: "¹⁵ The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison\
      \ in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and
      Jeremiah had remained there many days, '
    17: "¹⁷ then Zedekiah the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him\
      \ secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?”\nJeremiah said, “There\
      \ is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you,
      against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? '
    19: '¹⁹ Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of
      Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’ '
    20: "²⁰ Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented\
      \ before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,\
      \ lest I die there.” \n"
    21: ²¹ Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the
      court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street,
      until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court
      of the guard.
  38:
    1: '¹ Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal
      the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that
      Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the
      famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live,
      and he will escape with his life, and he will live.’ '
    3: "³ Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of\
      \ the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death;\
      \ because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and\
      \ the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man\
      \ doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t\
      \ do anything to oppose you.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the\
      \ king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with\
      \ cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the\
      \ mire. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house,
      heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in
      Benjamin’s gate), '
    8: '⁸ Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying, '
    9: "⁹ “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to\
      \ die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more\
      \ bread in the city.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here\
      \ thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon,\
      \ before he dies.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king
      under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let
      them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. '
    12: "¹² Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out\
      \ garments under your armpits under the cords.”\nJeremiah did so. "
    13: "¹³ So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon;\
      \ and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into\
      \ the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah,\
      \ “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not\
      \ surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives,\
      \ who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you\
      \ into the hand of these men who seek your life.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of
      Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your
      soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along
      with your house. '
    18: "¹⁸ But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this\
      \ city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with\
      \ fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have\
      \ defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they\
      \ mock me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s
      voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul
      will live. '
    21: '²¹ But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me: '
    22: "²² ‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will\
      \ be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say,\n\
      “Your familiar friends have turned on you,\n    and have prevailed over you.\n\
      Your feet are sunk in the mire,\n    they have turned away from you.” \n"
    23: "²³ They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans.\
      \ You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king\
      \ of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you
      won’t die. '
    25: '²⁵ But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to
      you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t
      hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king
      said to you;’ '
    26: "²⁶ then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king,\
      \ that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’”\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them\
      \ according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped\
      \ speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. \n"
    28: ²⁸ So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem
      was taken.
  39:
    1: '¹ In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. '
    2: '² In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of
      the month, a breach was made in the city. '
    3: '³ All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate,
      Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with
      all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they\
      \ fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden,\
      \ through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the
      plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment
      on him. '
    6: '⁶ Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes.
      The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: "⁷ Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him\
      \ to Babylon. \n"
    8: '⁸ The Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with
      fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon
      the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell
      away to him, and the residue of the people who remained. '
    10: "¹⁰ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people,\
      \ who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields\
      \ at the same time. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of
      the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying, '
    12: "¹² “Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as\
      \ he tells you.” \n"
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nebushazban, Rabsaris,
      and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; '
    14: "¹⁴ they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed\
      \ him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry\
      \ him home. So he lived among the people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court
      of the guard, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies,
      the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil,
      and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be
      given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. '
    18: ¹⁸ For I will surely save you, and you won’t fall by the sword, but you will
      escape with your life; because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’”
  40:
    1: '¹ The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain
      of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in
      chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away
      captive to Babylon. '
    2: '² The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “Yahweh your God
      pronounced this evil on this place; '
    3: '³ and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have
      sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has
      come on you. '
    4: '⁴ Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand.
      If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take
      care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t.
      Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to
      go, there go.” '
    5: "⁵ Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah\
      \ the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor\
      \ over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever\
      \ it seems right to you to go.”\nSo the captain of the guard gave him food and\
      \ a present, and let him go. "
    6: "⁶ Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with\
      \ him among the people who were left in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they
      and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
      governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of
      the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon; '
    8: '⁸ then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of
      Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite,
      and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah
      to Mizpah. '
    9: '⁹ Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their
      men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and
      serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. '
    10: "¹⁰ As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans\
      \ who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put\
      \ them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of
      Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of
      Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah
      the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; '
    12: "¹² then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and\
      \ came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much\
      \ wine and summer fruits. \n"
    13: '¹³ Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
      who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, '
    14: "¹⁴ and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of\
      \ Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?”\nBut Gedaliah\
      \ the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying,\
      \ “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man\
      \ will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered\
      \ to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You
      shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.”
  41:
    1: '¹ Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama,
      of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men
      with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread
      together in Mizpah. '
    2: '² Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him,
      and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and
      killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah,\
      \ and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war. \n"
    4: '⁴ The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it, '
    5: '⁵ men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having
      their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with
      meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house. '
    6: '⁶ Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping
      all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah
      the son of Ahikam.” '
    7: '⁷ It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the
      son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he,
      and the men who were with him. '
    8: "⁸ But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us;\
      \ for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil,\
      \ and of honey.”\nSo he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers. "
    9: "⁹ Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he\
      \ had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had\
      \ made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled\
      \ it with those who were killed. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah,\
      \ even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom\
      \ Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of\
      \ Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed\
      \ to go over to the children of Ammon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
      who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had
      done, '
    12: '¹² then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of
      Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah,
      and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad. '
    14: '¹⁴ So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned
      about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. '
    15: "¹⁵ But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,\
      \ and went to the children of Ammon. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who
      were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from
      Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the
      son of Ahikam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs,
      whom he had brought back from Gibeon. '
    17: '¹⁷ They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go
      to enter into Egypt '
    18: ¹⁸ because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
      the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of
      Babylon made governor over the land.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and
      Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the
      greatest, came near, '
    2: '² and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented
      before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for
      we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us; '
    3: "³ that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the\
      \ things that we should do.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will\
      \ pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it will happen that whatever\
      \ thing Yahweh answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back\
      \ from you.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among
      us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God sends
      you to tell us. '
    6: "⁶ Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh\
      \ our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the\
      \ voice of Yahweh our God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
      who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, '
    9: '⁹ and said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present
      your supplication before him, says: '
    10: '¹⁰ ‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull
      you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the
      distress that I have brought on you. '
    11: '¹¹ Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t
      be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh: ‘for I am with you to save you, and to deliver
      you from his hand. '
    12: "¹² I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to\
      \ return to your own land. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land;” so that you don’t
      obey Yahweh your God’s voice, '
    14: '¹⁴ saying, “No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see
      no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there
      we will dwell:”’ '
    15: '¹⁵ now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah: Yahweh of Armies,
      the God of Israel, says, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt,
      and go to live there; '
    16: '¹⁶ then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you
      there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will
      follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there. '
    17: '¹⁷ So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to
      live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
      None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’ '
    18: "¹⁸ For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and my wrath\
      \ has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured\
      \ out on you, when you enter into Egypt; and you will be an object of horror,\
      \ an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.’\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, ‘Don’t go into Egypt!’
      Know certainly that I have testified to you today. '
    20: '²⁰ For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me
      to Yahweh your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to
      all that Yahweh our God says, so declare to us, and we will do it.’ '
    21: '²¹ I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your God’s
      voice in anything for which he has sent me to you. '
    22: ²² Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine,
      and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live there.”
  43:
    1: '¹ When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh
      their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these
      words, '
    2: '² then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the
      proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. Yahweh our God has
      not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’ '
    3: "³ but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into\
      \ the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away\
      \ captive to Babylon.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all
      the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah. '
    5: '⁵ But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took
      all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had
      been driven, to live in the land of Judah; '
    6: '⁶ the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and
      every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah
      the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch
      the son of Neriah; '
    7: "⁷ and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice:\
      \ and they came to Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work,
      which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men
      of Judah; '
    10: '¹⁰ and tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will
      send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his
      throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion
      over them. '
    11: '¹¹ He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death
      will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as
      are for the sword to the sword. '
    12: '¹² I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. He will burn
      them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt,
      as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace. '
    13: ¹³ He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of
      Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’”
  44:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the
      land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in
      the country of Pathros, saying, '
    2: '² “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have seen all the evil
      that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah. Behold, today
      they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them, '
    3: '³ because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger,
      in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know,
      neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. '
    4: '⁴ However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and
      sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.” '
    5: '⁵ But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from
      their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities\
      \ of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate,\
      \ as it is today.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore now Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Why
      do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves
      man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave
      yourselves no one remaining; '
    8: '⁸ in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense
      to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may
      be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations
      of the earth? '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of
      the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness,
      and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked\
      \ in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will
      set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. '
    12: '¹² I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into
      the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall
      in the land of Egypt. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine.
      They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the
      famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and
      a reproach. '
    13: '¹³ For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished
      Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; '
    14: "¹⁴ so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt\
      \ to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to\
      \ which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for no one will return\
      \ except those who will escape.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods,
      and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived
      in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, we will
      not listen to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth,
      to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to
      her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the
      cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of
      food, and were well, and saw no evil. '
    18: "¹⁸ But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring\
      \ out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed\
      \ by the sword and by the famine.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The women said, “When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured\
      \ out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour\
      \ out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even
      to all the people who had given him an answer, saying, '
    21: '²¹ “The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets
      of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people
      of the land, didn’t Yahweh remember them, and didn’t it come into his mind? '
    22: '²² Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings,
      and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land
      has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant,
      as it is today. '
    23: "²³ Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh,\
      \ and have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes,\
      \ nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is\
      \ today.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear
      Yahweh’s word, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! '
    25: "²⁵ Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘You and your wives have both\
      \ spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, “We\
      \ will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen\
      \ of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her.”\n“‘Establish then your\
      \ vows, and perform your vows.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt:
      ‘Behold, I have sworn by my great name,’ says Yahweh, ‘that my name will no
      more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,
      “As the Lord Yahweh lives.” '
    27: '²⁷ Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men
      of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the
      famine, until they are all gone. '
    28: "²⁸ Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the\
      \ land of Judah few in number. All the remnant of Judah, who have gone into\
      \ the land of Egypt to live there, will know whose word will stand, mine or\
      \ theirs. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “‘This will be the sign to you,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will punish you
      in this place, that you may know that my words will surely stand against you
      for evil.’ '
    30: ³⁰ Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the
      hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life; as I gave
      Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who
      was his enemy, and sought his life.’”

    62: '⁶² and say, ‘Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off,
      that no one will dwell in it, neither man nor animal, but that it will be desolate
      forever.’ '
    63: '⁶³ It will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind
      a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates. '
    64: "⁶⁴ Then you shall say, ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and will not rise again because\
      \ of the evil that I will bring on her; and they will be weary.’”\nThus far\
      \ are the words of Jeremiah."
  52:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign. He reigned eleven
      years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah
      of Libnah. '
    2: '² He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim
      had done. '
    3: "³ For through Yahweh’s anger this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he\
      \ had cast them out from his presence.\nZedekiah rebelled against the king of\
      \ Babylon. "
    4: '⁴ In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of
      the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against
      Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. '
    5: "⁵ So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. \n"
    6: '⁶ In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe
      in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. '
    7: '⁷ Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went
      out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which
      was by the king’s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around.
      The men of war went toward the Arabah, '
    8: '⁸ but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in
      the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. '
    9: '⁹ Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah
      in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. '
    10: '¹⁰ The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also
      killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. '
    11: "¹¹ He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in\
      \ fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of\
      \ his death. \n"
    12: '¹² Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth
      year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the
      guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ He burned Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house; and all the houses of
      Jerusalem, even every great house, he burned with fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard,
      broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the
      poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city,
      and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of
      the multitude. '
    16: "¹⁶ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land\
      \ to be vineyard keepers and farmers. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh’s house,
      and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house in pieces, and
      carried all of their bronze to Babylon. '
    18: '¹⁸ They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the
      spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered. '
    19: "¹⁹ The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins,\
      \ the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold,\
      \ in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver. \n"
    20: '²⁰ They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that
      were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house. The bronze
      of all these vessels was without weight. '
    21: '²¹ As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits;
      and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers.
      It was hollow. '
    22: '²² A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the one capital was five
      cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze:
      and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates. '
    23: "²³ There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates\
      \ were one hundred on the network all around. \n"
    24: '²⁴ The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah
      the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold: '
    25: '²⁵ and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war;
      and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city;
      and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land;
      and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the
      city. '
    26: '²⁶ Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the
      king of Babylon to Riblah. '
    27: "²⁷ The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the\
      \ land of Hamath.\nSo Judah was carried away captive out of his land. "
    28: "²⁸ This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:\n\
      in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews; \n"
    29: "²⁹ in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from\
      \ Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons; \n"
    30: "³⁰ in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of\
      \ the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five people:\n\
      all the people were four thousand six hundred. \n"
    31: '³¹ In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
      in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king
      of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin
      king of Judah, and released him from prison. '
    32: '³² He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings
      who were with him in Babylon, '
    33: '³³ and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually
      all the days of his life. '
    34: ³⁴ For his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king
      of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of
      his life.
