Titus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the
      faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according
      to godliness, '
    2: '² in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time
      began; '
    3: '³ but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted
      according to the commandment of God our Savior; '
    4: "⁴ to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace\
      \ from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. \n"
    5: '⁵ I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things
      that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you, '
    6: '⁶ if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe,
      who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior. '
    7: '⁷ For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing,
      not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest
      gain; '
    8: '⁸ but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, '
    9: "⁹ holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he\
      \ may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict\
      \ him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially
      those of the circumcision, '
    11: '¹¹ whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching
      things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. '
    12: '¹² One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars,
      evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” '
    13: '¹³ This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they
      may be sound in the faith, '
    14: '¹⁴ not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn
      away from the truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving,
      nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. '
    16: ¹⁶ They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being
      abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
  2:
    1: '¹ But say the things which fit sound doctrine, '
    2: '² that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith,
      in love, and in perseverance: '
    3: '³ and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor
      enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, '
    4: '⁴ that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their
      children, '
    5: '⁵ to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to
      their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. '
    6: '⁶ Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. '
    7: '⁷ In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching,
      show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, '
    8: '⁸ and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you
      may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. '
    9: '⁹ Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing
      in all things, not contradicting, '
    10: '¹⁰ not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine
      of God, our Savior, in all things. '
    11: '¹¹ For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, '
    12: '¹² instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
      we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; '
    13: '¹³ looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God
      and Savior, Jesus Christ, '
    14: "¹⁴ who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and\
      \ purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.\
      \ \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one
      despise you.
  3:
    1: '¹ Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient,
      to be ready for every good work, '
    2: '² to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all
      humility toward all men. '
    3: '³ For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts
      and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. '
    4: '⁴ But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, '
    5: '⁵ not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his
      mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy
      Spirit, '
    6: '⁶ whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; '
    7: '⁷ that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the
      hope of eternal life. '
    8: '⁸ This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm
      confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain
      good works. These things are good and profitable to men; '
    9: '⁹ but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the
      law; for they are unprofitable and vain. '
    10: '¹⁰ Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, '
    11: "¹¹ knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned. \n"
    12: '¹² When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to
      Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. '
    13: '¹³ Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing
      may be lacking for them. '
    14: "¹⁴ Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that\
      \ they may not be unfruitful. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace
      be with you all. Amen.
