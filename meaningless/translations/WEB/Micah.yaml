Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ Yahweh’s word that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz,\
      \ and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, you peoples, all of you.\n    Listen, O earth, and all that is therein:\n\
      and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,\n    the Lord from his holy\
      \ temple.\n"
    3: "³ For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place,\n    and will come down and\
      \ tread on the high places of the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ The mountains melt under him,\n    and the valleys split apart,\n    like\
      \ wax before the fire,\n    like waters that are poured down a steep place.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ “All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,\n    and for the sins of the\
      \ house of Israel.\nWhat is the disobedience of Jacob?\n    Isn’t it Samaria?\n\
      And what are the high places of Judah?\n    Aren’t they Jerusalem?\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,\n    like\
      \ places for planting vineyards;\nand I will pour down its stones into the valley,\n\
      \    and I will uncover its foundations.\n"
    7: "⁷ All her idols will be beaten to pieces,\n    and all her temple gifts will\
      \ be burned with fire,\n    and all her images I will destroy;\nfor of the hire\
      \ of a prostitute has she gathered them,\n    and to the hire of a prostitute\
      \ shall they return.” \n"
    8: "⁸ For this I will lament and wail;\n    I will go stripped and naked;\n  \
      \  I will howl like the jackals,\n    and moan like the daughters of owls.\n"
    9: "⁹ For her wounds are incurable;\n    for it has come even to Judah.\nIt reaches\
      \ to the gate of my people,\n    even to Jerusalem.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Don’t tell it in Gath.\n    Don’t weep at all.\n    At Beth Ophrah I have\
      \ rolled myself in the dust.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.\n    The inhabitant\
      \ of Zaanan won’t come out.\n    The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you\
      \ his protection.\n"
    12: "¹² For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,\n    because evil\
      \ has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.\n    She\
      \ was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;\n    For the transgressions\
      \ of Israel were found in you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.\n    The houses\
      \ of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah, him who will possess\
      \ you.\n    He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Shave your heads,\n    and cut off your hair for the children of your\
      \ delight.\nEnlarge your baldness like the vulture;\n    for they have gone\
      \ into captivity from you!"
  2:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who devise iniquity\n    and work evil on their beds!\nWhen\
      \ the morning is light, they practice it,\n    because it is in the power of\
      \ their hand.\n"
    2: "² They covet fields, and seize them;\n    and houses, and take them away:\n\
      \    and they oppress a man and his house,\n    even a man and his heritage.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore Yahweh says:\n“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,\n\
      \    from which you will not remove your necks,\n    neither will you walk haughtily;\n\
      \    for it is an evil time.\n"
    4: "⁴ In that day they will take up a parable against you,\n    and lament with\
      \ a doleful lamentation, saying,\n    ‘We are utterly ruined!\n    My people’s\
      \ possession is divided up.\n    Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our\
      \ fields to traitors!’”\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly.\n"
    6: "⁶ “Don’t prophesy!”\n    They prophesy.\n“Don’t prophesy about these things.\n\
      \    Disgrace won’t overtake us.”\n"
    7: "⁷ Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:\n    “Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry?\n  \
      \  Are these his doings?\n    Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”\n"
    8: "⁸ But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.\n    You strip the robe\
      \ and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.\n"
    9: "⁹ You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;\n    from\
      \ their young children you take away my blessing forever.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Arise, and depart!\n    For this is not your resting place,\n    because\
      \ of uncleanness that destroys,\n    even with a grievous destruction.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:\n    “I will prophesy\
      \ to you of wine and of strong drink;”\n    he would be the prophet of this\
      \ people.\n"
    12: "¹² I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;\n    I will surely gather the\
      \ remnant of Israel;\nI will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,\n   \
      \ as a flock in the middle of their pasture;\n    they will swarm with people.\n"
    13: "¹³ He who breaks open the way goes up before them.\n    They break through\
      \ the gate, and go out.\n    And their king passes on before them,\n    with\
      \ Yahweh at their head."
  3:
    1: "¹ I said,\n“Please listen, you heads of Jacob,\n    and rulers of the house\
      \ of Israel:\n    Isn’t it for you to know justice?\n"
    2: "² You who hate the good,\n    and love the evil;\n    who tear off their skin,\n\
      \    and their flesh from off their bones;\n"
    3: "³     who also eat the flesh of my people,\n    and peel their skin from off\
      \ them,\n    and break their bones,\n    and chop them in pieces, as for the\
      \ pot,\n    and as meat within the cauldron.\n"
    4: "⁴ Then they will cry to Yahweh,\n    but he will not answer them.\nYes, he\
      \ will hide his face from them at that time,\n    because they made their deeds\
      \ evil.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those\
      \ who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide\
      \ for their mouths, they prepare war against him: \n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore night is over you, with no vision,\n    and it is dark to you,\
      \ that you may not divine;\n    and the sun will go down on the prophets,\n\
      \    and the day will be black over them.\n"
    7: "⁷ The seers shall be disappointed,\n    and the diviners confounded.\nYes,\
      \ they shall all cover their lips;\n    for there is no answer from God.”\n"
    8: "⁸ But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit,\n    and of judgment,\
      \ and of might,\n    to declare to Jacob his disobedience,\n    and to Israel\
      \ his sin.\n"
    9: "⁹ Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,\n    and rulers\
      \ of the house of Israel,\n    who abhor justice,\n    and pervert all equity.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They build up Zion with blood,\n    and Jerusalem with iniquity.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Her leaders judge for bribes,\n    and her priests teach for a price,\n\
      \    and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:\nyet they lean on Yahweh,\
      \ and say,\n    “Isn’t Yahweh among us?\n    No disaster will come on us.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,\n    and Jerusalem\
      \ will become heaps of rubble,\n    and the mountain of the temple like the\
      \ high places of a forest."
  4:
    1: "¹ But in the latter days,\n    it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s\
      \ temple will be established on the top of the mountains,\n    and it will be\
      \ exalted above the hills;\n    and peoples will stream to it.\n"
    2: "² Many nations will go and say,\n    “Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of\
      \ Yahweh,\n    and to the house of the God of Jacob;\n    and he will teach\
      \ us of his ways,\n    and we will walk in his paths.”\nFor the law will go\
      \ out of Zion,\n    and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;\n"
    3: "³ and he will judge between many peoples,\n    and will decide concerning\
      \ strong nations afar off.\n    They will beat their swords into plowshares,\n\
      \    and their spears into pruning hooks.\nNation will not lift up sword against\
      \ nation,\n    neither will they learn war any more.\n"
    4: "⁴ But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;\n   \
      \ and no one will make them afraid:\nFor the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken. "
    5: "⁵     Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;\n    but\
      \ we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.\n"
    6: "⁶ “In that day,” says Yahweh,\n    “I will assemble that which is lame,\n\
      \    and I will gather that which is driven away,\n    and that which I have\
      \ afflicted;\n"
    7: "⁷     and I will make that which was lame a remnant,\n    and that which was\
      \ cast far off a strong nation:\n    and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount\
      \ Zion from then on, even forever.”\n"
    8: "⁸ You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,\n    to you it\
      \ will come,\n    yes, the former dominion will come,\n    the kingdom of the\
      \ daughter of Jerusalem.\n"
    9: "⁹ Now why do you cry out aloud?\n    Is there no king in you?\n    Has your\
      \ counselor perished,\n    that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in\
      \ travail?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,\n    like a woman\
      \ in travail;\n    for now you will go out of the city,\n    and will dwell\
      \ in the field,\n    and will come even to Babylon.\nThere you will be rescued.\n\
      \    There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,\n    “Let her be\
      \ defiled,\n    and let our eye gloat over Zion.”\n"
    12: "¹² But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,\n    neither do they understand\
      \ his counsel;\n    for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing\
      \ floor.\n"
    13: "¹³ Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;\n    for I will make your horn iron,\n\
      \    and I will make your hoofs bronze;\nand you will beat in pieces many peoples:\n\
      and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,\n    and their substance to the Lord\
      \ of the whole earth."
  5:
    1: "¹ Now you shall gather yourself in troops,\n    daughter of troops.\nHe has\
      \ laid siege against us.\n    They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod\
      \ on the cheek.\n"
    2: "² But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,\n    being small among the clans of Judah,\n\
      \    out of you one will come out to me that is to be ruler in Israel;\n   \
      \ whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives\
      \ birth.\n    Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.\n"
    4: "⁴ He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh,\n    in the\
      \ majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:\n    and they will live, for then he\
      \ will be great to the ends of the earth.\n"
    5: "⁵ He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,\n    and when he marches\
      \ through our fortresses,\n    then we will raise against him seven shepherds,\n\
      \    and eight leaders of men.\n"
    6: "⁶ They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,\n    and the land of\
      \ Nimrod in its gates.\nHe will deliver us from the Assyrian,\n    when he invades\
      \ our land,\n    and when he marches within our border.\n"
    7: "⁷ The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples,\n    like dew from Yahweh,\n\
      \    like showers on the grass,\n    that don’t wait for man,\n    nor wait\
      \ for the sons of men.\n"
    8: "⁸ The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,\n    among many peoples,\n\
      \    like a lion among the animals of the forest,\n    like a young lion among\
      \ the flocks of sheep;\n    who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in\
      \ pieces,\n    and there is no one to deliver.\n"
    9: "⁹ Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries,\n    and let all of your\
      \ enemies be cut off.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh,\n    “that I will cut off your\
      \ horses out from among you,\n    and will destroy your chariots.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will cut off the cities of your land,\n    and will tear down all your\
      \ strongholds.\n"
    12: "¹² I will destroy witchcraft from your hand;\n    and you shall have no soothsayers.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out from among you;\n\
      \    and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will uproot your Asherah poles out from among you;\n    and I will destroy\
      \ your cities.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will execute vengeance in anger,\n    and wrath on the nations that\
      \ didn’t listen.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Listen now to what Yahweh says:\n“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,\n\
      \    and let the hills hear what you have to say.\n"
    2: "² Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s indictment,\n    and you enduring foundations\
      \ of the earth;\n    for Yahweh has a case against his people,\n    and he will\
      \ contend with Israel.\n"
    3: "³ My people, what have I done to you?\n    How have I burdened you?\n    Answer\
      \ me!\n"
    4: "⁴ For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,\n    and redeemed you out\
      \ of the house of bondage.\n    I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.\n"
    5: "⁵ My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,\n    and what Balaam\
      \ the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal,\n    that you may know\
      \ the righteous acts of Yahweh.” \n"
    6: "⁶ How shall I come before Yahweh,\n    and bow myself before the exalted God?\n\
      Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,\n    with calves a year old?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams?\n    With tens of thousands\
      \ of rivers of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?\n    The\
      \ fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\n"
    8: "⁸ He has shown you, O man, what is good.\n    What does Yahweh require of\
      \ you, but to act justly,\n    to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Yahweh’s voice calls to the city,\n    and wisdom sees your name:\n“Listen\
      \ to the rod,\n    and he who appointed it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,\n  \
      \  and a short ephah that is accursed?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Shall I be pure with dishonest scales,\n    and with a bag of deceitful\
      \ weights?\n"
    12: "¹² Her rich men are full of violence,\n    her inhabitants speak lies,\n\
      \    and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound.\n    I have made\
      \ you desolate because of your sins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall eat, but not be satisfied.\n    Your humiliation will be within\
      \ you.\n    You will store up, but not save;\n    and that which you save I\
      \ will give up to the sword.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You will sow, but won’t reap.\n    You will tread the olives, but won’t\
      \ anoint yourself with oil;\n    and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For the statutes of Omri are kept,\n    and all the works of Ahab’s house.\n\
      \    You walk in their counsels,\n    that I may make you a ruin,\n    and her\
      \ inhabitants a hissing;\n    And you will bear the reproach of my people.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ Misery is mine!\n    Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits,\
      \ as gleanings of the vineyard:\n    There is no cluster of grapes to eat.\n\
      \    My soul desires to eat the early fig.\n"
    2: "² The godly man has perished out of the earth,\n    and there is no one upright\
      \ among men.\n    They all lie in wait for blood;\n    every man hunts his brother\
      \ with a net.\n"
    3: "³ Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.\n    The ruler\
      \ and judge ask for a bribe;\n    and the powerful man dictates the evil desire\
      \ of his soul.\n    Thus they conspire together.\n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is like a brier.\n    The most upright is worse than a\
      \ thorn hedge.\nThe day of your watchmen,\n    even your visitation, has come;\n\
      \    now is the time of their confusion.\n"
    5: "⁵ Don’t trust in a neighbor.\n    Don’t put confidence in a friend.\n    With\
      \ the woman lying in your embrace,\n    be careful of the words of your mouth!\n"
    6: "⁶ For the son dishonors the father,\n    the daughter rises up against her\
      \ mother,\n    the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;\n    a man’s enemies\
      \ are the men of his own house.\n"
    7: "⁷ But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.\n    I will wait for the God of my\
      \ salvation.\n    My God will hear me.\n"
    8: "⁸ Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.\n    When I fall, I will arise.\n  \
      \  When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,\n    because I have sinned against\
      \ him,\n    until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me.\n    He will\
      \ bring me out to the light.\n    I will see his righteousness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then my enemy will see it,\n    and shame will cover her who said to me,\n\
      \    where is Yahweh your God?\nThen my enemy will see me and will cover her\
      \ shame.\n    Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.\n"
    11: "¹¹ A day to build your walls!\n    In that day, he will extend your boundary.\n"
    12: "¹² In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,\n\
      \    and from Egypt even to the River,\n    and from sea to sea,\n    and mountain\
      \ to mountain.\n"
    13: "¹³ Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,\n  \
      \  for the fruit of their doings.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shepherd your people with your staff,\n    the flock of your heritage,\n\
      \    who dwell by themselves in a forest,\n    in the middle of fertile pasture\
      \ land, let them feed;\n    in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ “As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,\n    I will show\
      \ them marvelous things.”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.\n    They will\
      \ lay their hand on their mouth.\n    Their ears will be deaf.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They will lick the dust like a serpent.\n    Like crawling things of the\
      \ earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.\n    They will come with\
      \ fear to Yahweh our God,\n    and will be afraid because of you.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,\n    and passes over the\
      \ disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?\nHe doesn’t retain his anger\
      \ forever,\n    because he delights in loving kindness.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will again have compassion on us.\n    He will tread our iniquities\
      \ under foot;\n    and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You will give truth to Jacob,\n    and mercy to Abraham,\n    as you have\
      \ sworn to our fathers from the days of old."
