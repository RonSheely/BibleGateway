Leviticus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying, '
    2: "² “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When anyone of you offers\
      \ an offering to Yahweh, you shall offer your offering of the livestock, from\
      \ the herd and from the flock. \n"
    3: '³ “‘If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male
      without defect. He shall offer it at the door of the Tent of Meeting, that he
      may be accepted before Yahweh. '
    4: '⁴ He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be
      accepted for him to make atonement for him. '
    5: '⁵ He shall kill the bull before Yahweh. Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present
      the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the door of
      the Tent of Meeting. '
    6: '⁶ He shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in
      order on the fire; '
    8: '⁸ and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat
      in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar; '
    9: "⁹ but he shall wash its innards and its legs with water. The priest shall\
      \ burn all of it on the altar, for a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,\
      \ of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘If his offering is from the flock, from the sheep or from the goats,
      for a burnt offering, he shall offer a male without defect. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before Yahweh. Aaron’s
      sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. '
    12: '¹² He shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat. The priest
      shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar, '
    13: "¹³ but the innards and the legs he shall wash with water. The priest shall\
      \ offer the whole, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering\
      \ made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall
      offer his offering from turtledoves or of young pigeons. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn
      it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar; '
    16: '¹⁶ and he shall take away its crop and its feathers, and cast it beside the
      altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes. '
    17: ¹⁷ He shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it apart. The priest
      shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering,
      an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
  2:
    1: '¹ “‘When anyone offers an offering of a meal offering to Yahweh, his offering
      shall be of fine flour. He shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it. '
    2: '² He shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests. He shall take his handful
      of its fine flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense, and the priest
      shall burn its memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant
      aroma to Yahweh. '
    3: "³ That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.\
      \ It is a most holy part of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘When you offer an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall
      be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed
      with oil. '
    5: '⁵ If your offering is a meal offering made on a griddle, it shall be of unleavened
      fine flour, mixed with oil. '
    6: '⁶ You shall cut it in pieces, and pour oil on it. It is a meal offering. '
    7: '⁷ If your offering is a meal offering of the pan, it shall be made of fine
      flour with oil. '
    8: '⁸ You shall bring the meal offering that is made of these things to Yahweh.
      It shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar. '
    9: '⁹ The priest shall take from the meal offering its memorial, and shall burn
      it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. '
    10: "¹⁰ That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.\
      \ It is a most holy part of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘No meal offering which you shall offer to Yahweh shall be made with
      yeast; for you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire
      to Yahweh. '
    12: '¹² As an offering of first fruits you shall offer them to Yahweh, but they
      shall not rise up as a pleasant aroma on the altar. '
    13: "¹³ Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt. You shall\
      \ not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meal\
      \ offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If you offer a meal offering of first fruits to Yahweh, you shall offer
      for the meal offering of your first fruits fresh heads of grain parched with
      fire and crushed. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall put oil on it and lay frankincense on it. It is a meal offering. '
    16: ¹⁶ The priest shall burn as its memorial part of its crushed grain and part
      of its oil, along with all its frankincense. It is an offering made by fire
      to Yahweh.
  3:
    1: '¹ “‘If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he offers it from
      the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect before Yahweh. '
    2: '² He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door
      of the Tent of Meeting. Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood
      around on the altar. '
    3: '³ He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire
      to Yahweh. The fat that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, '
    4: '⁴ and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins,
      and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away. '
    5: "⁵ Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar on the burnt offering, which is\
      \ on the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a pleasant\
      \ aroma to Yahweh. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh is from the
      flock, either male or female, he shall offer it without defect. '
    7: '⁷ If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before Yahweh; '
    8: '⁸ and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it before
      the Tent of Meeting. Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. '
    9: '⁹ He shall offer from the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by
      fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire tail fat, he shall take away close to the
      backbone; and the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is on the
      entrails, '
    10: '¹⁰ and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins,
      and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away. '
    11: "¹¹ The priest shall burn it on the altar: it is the food of the offering\
      \ made by fire to Yahweh. \n"
    12: '¹² “‘If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before Yahweh. '
    13: '¹³ He shall lay his hand on its head, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting;
      and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ He shall offer from it as his offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh;
      the fat that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, '
    15: '¹⁵ and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins,
      and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away. '
    16: "¹⁶ The priest shall burn them on the altar: it is the food of the offering\
      \ made by fire, for a pleasant aroma; all the fat is Yahweh’s. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ “‘It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your
      dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood.’”
  4:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If anyone sins unintentionally,
      in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and does any
      one of them, '
    3: '³ if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let
      him offer for his sin which he has sinned a young bull without defect to Yahweh
      for a sin offering. '
    4: '⁴ He shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh;
      and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before
      Yahweh. '
    5: '⁵ The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull, and bring
      it to the Tent of Meeting. '
    6: '⁶ The priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of the blood
      seven times before Yahweh, before the veil of the sanctuary. '
    7: '⁷ The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet
      incense before Yahweh, which is in the Tent of Meeting; and he shall pour out
      the rest of the blood of the bull at the base of the altar of burnt offering,
      which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting. '
    8: '⁸ He shall take all the fat of the bull of the sin offering from it: the fat
      that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, '
    9: '⁹ and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins,
      and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall remove, '
    10: '¹⁰ as it is removed from the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings. The
      priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall carry the bull’s skin, all its meat, with its head, and with
      its legs, its innards, and its dung '
    12: "¹² —all the rest of the bull—outside of the camp to a clean place where the\
      \ ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire. It shall be burned where\
      \ the ashes are poured out. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘If the whole congregation of Israel sins, and the thing is hidden from
      the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Yahweh
      has commanded not to be done, and are guilty; '
    14: '¹⁴ when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall
      offer a young bull for a sin offering, and bring it before the Tent of Meeting. '
    15: '¹⁵ The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the
      bull before Yahweh; and the bull shall be killed before Yahweh. '
    16: '¹⁶ The anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull to the Tent
      of Meeting. '
    17: '¹⁷ The priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times
      before Yahweh, before the veil. '
    18: '¹⁸ He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before
      Yahweh, that is in the Tent of Meeting; and the rest of the blood he shall pour
      out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the
      Tent of Meeting. '
    19: '¹⁹ All its fat he shall take from it, and burn it on the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ He shall do this with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin offering,
      so he shall do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and
      they shall be forgiven. '
    21: "²¹ He shall carry the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the\
      \ first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly. \n"
    22: '²² “‘When a ruler sins, and unwittingly does any one of all the things which
      Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty, '
    23: '²³ if his sin in which he has sinned is made known to him, he shall bring
      as his offering a goat, a male without defect. '
    24: '²⁴ He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place
      where they kill the burnt offering before Yahweh. It is a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
      and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He shall pour out the
      rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. '
    26: "²⁶ All its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice\
      \ of peace offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning\
      \ his sin, and he will be forgiven. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “‘If anyone of the common people sins unwittingly, in doing any of the
      things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and is guilty, '
    28: '²⁸ if his sin which he has sinned is made known to him, then he shall bring
      for his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he has sinned. '
    29: '²⁹ He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin
      offering in the place of burnt offering. '
    30: '³⁰ The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and put it on
      the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall
      pour out at the base of the altar. '
    31: "³¹ All its fat he shall take away, like the fat is taken away from the sacrifice\
      \ of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant\
      \ aroma to Yahweh; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will\
      \ be forgiven. \n"
    32: '³² “‘If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring
      a female without defect. '
    33: '³³ He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill it for
      a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. '
    34: '³⁴ The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
      and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of
      its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar. '
    35: ³⁵ He shall remove all its fat, like the fat of the lamb is removed from the
      sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest shall burn them on the altar, on the
      offerings of Yahweh made by fire. The priest shall make atonement for him concerning
      his sin that he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.
  5:
    1: "¹ “‘If anyone sins, in that he hears a public adjuration to testify, he being\
      \ a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he doesn’t report it, then he\
      \ shall bear his iniquity. \n"
    2: "² “‘Or if anyone touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an\
      \ unclean animal, or the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of unclean\
      \ creeping things, and it is hidden from him, and he is unclean, then he shall\
      \ be guilty. \n"
    3: "³ “‘Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is with\
      \ which he is unclean, and it is hidden from him; when he knows of it, then\
      \ he shall be guilty. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good—whatever
      it is that a man might utter rashly with an oath, and it is hidden from him—when
      he knows of it, then he will be guilty of one of these. '
    5: '⁵ It shall be, when he is guilty of one of these, he shall confess that in
      which he has sinned; '
    6: "⁶ and he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh for his sin which he\
      \ has sinned: a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering;\
      \ and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘If he can’t afford a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass offering for
      that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh;
      one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. '
    8: '⁸ He shall bring them to the priest, who shall first offer the one which is
      for the sin offering. He shall wring off its head from its neck, but shall not
      sever it completely. '
    9: '⁹ He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the
      altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar.
      It is a sin offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance;\
      \ and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has\
      \ sinned, and he shall be forgiven. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘But if he can’t afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he
      shall bring as his offering for that in which he has sinned, one tenth of an
      ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, and he shall
      not put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering. '
    12: '¹² He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful
      of it as the memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of
      Yahweh made by fire. It is a sin offering. '
    13: "¹³ The priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin that he has\
      \ sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven; and the rest shall\
      \ be the priest’s, as the meal offering.’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    15: '¹⁵ “If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly regarding Yahweh’s
      holy things, then he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh: a ram without
      defect from the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, according
      to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering. '
    16: "¹⁶ He shall make restitution for that which he has done wrong regarding the\
      \ holy thing, and shall add a fifth part to it, and give it to the priest; and\
      \ the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering,\
      \ and he will be forgiven. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “If anyone sins, doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not
      to be done, though he didn’t know it, he is still guilty, and shall bear his
      iniquity. '
    18: '¹⁸ He shall bring a ram without defect from of the flock, according to your
      estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest; and the priest shall make
      atonement for him concerning the thing in which he sinned and didn’t know it,
      and he will be forgiven. '
    19: ¹⁹ It is a trespass offering. He is certainly guilty before Yahweh.”
  6:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against Yahweh, and deals falsely
      with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or has
      oppressed his neighbor, '
    3: '³ or has found that which was lost, and lied about it, and swearing to a lie—in
      any of these things that a man sins in his actions— '
    4: '⁴ then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall restore that
      which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or
      the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, '
    5: '⁵ or any thing about which he has sworn falsely: he shall restore it in full,
      and shall add a fifth part more to it. He shall return it to him to whom it
      belongs in the day of his being found guilty. '
    6: '⁶ He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh: a ram without defect from
      the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest. '
    7: "⁷ The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven\
      \ concerning whatever he does to become guilty.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering:
      the burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning;
      and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it. '
    10: '¹⁰ The priest shall put on his linen garment, and he shall put on his linen
      trousers upon his body; and he shall remove the ashes from where the fire has
      consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry the
      ashes outside the camp to a clean place. '
    12: '¹² The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not go out;
      and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning. He shall lay the burnt offering
      in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings. '
    13: "¹³ Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘This is the law of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer
      it before Yahweh, before the altar. '
    15: '¹⁵ He shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering,

      shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma, as its memorial portion, to
      Yahweh. '
    16: '¹⁶ That which is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten
      without yeast in a holy place. They shall eat it in the court of the Tent of
      Meeting. '
    17: '¹⁷ It shall not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of
      my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as are the sin offering and the
      trespass offering. '
    18: "¹⁸ Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as their portion\
      \ forever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Yahweh made by\
      \ fire. Whoever touches them shall be holy.’” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    20: '²⁰ “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer
      to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed: one tenth of an ephah of fine flour
      for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in
      the evening. '
    21: '²¹ It shall be made with oil in a griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring
      it in. You shall offer the meal offering in baked pieces for a pleasant aroma
      to Yahweh. '
    22: '²² The anointed priest that will be in his place from among his sons shall
      offer it. By a statute forever, it shall be wholly burned to Yahweh. '
    23: "²³ Every meal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be\
      \ eaten.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    25: '²⁵ “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering:
      in the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed
      before Yahweh. It is most holy. '
    26: '²⁶ The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a
      holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. '
    27: '²⁷ Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its
      blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled
      in a holy place. '
    28: '²⁸ But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it
      is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. '
    29: '²⁹ Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It is most holy. '
    30: ³⁰ No sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of
      Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be eaten. It shall be burned
      with fire.
  7:
    1: '¹ “‘This is the law of the trespass offering: It is most holy. '
    2: '² In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall kill the trespass
      offering; and its blood he shall sprinkle around on the altar. '
    3: '³ He shall offer all of its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the
      innards, '
    4: '⁴ and he shall take away the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which
      is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys; '
    5: '⁵ and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire
      to Yahweh: it is a trespass offering. '
    6: "⁶ Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy\
      \ place. It is most holy. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering; there is one law
      for them. The priest who makes atonement with them shall have it. '
    8: '⁸ The priest who offers any man’s burnt offering shall have for himself the
      skin of the burnt offering which he has offered. '
    9: '⁹ Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is prepared
      in the pan and on the griddle, shall be the priest’s who offers it. '
    10: "¹⁰ Every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all the sons of\
      \ Aaron, one as well as another. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which one shall
      offer to Yahweh: '
    12: '¹² If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice
      of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed
      with oil, and cakes mixed with oil. '
    13: '¹³ He shall offer his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings
      for thanksgiving with cakes of leavened bread. '
    14: '¹⁴ Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave offering to
      Yahweh. It shall be the priest’s who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings. '
    15: "¹⁵ The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall\
      \ be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the\
      \ morning. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a free will offering,
      it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice. On the next day what
      remains of it shall be eaten, '

      burned with fire. '
    18: "¹⁸ If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on\
      \ the third day, it will not be accepted, and it shall not be credited to him\
      \ who offers it. It will be an abomination, and the soul who eats any of it\
      \ will bear his iniquity. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “‘The meat that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall
      be burned with fire. As for the meat, everyone who is clean may eat it; '
    20: '²⁰ but the soul who eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings
      that belongs to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut
      off from his people. '
    21: "²¹ When anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean\

    22: '²² Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    23: '²³ “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘You shall eat no fat, of bull,
      or sheep, or goat. '
    24: '²⁴ The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn
      of animals, may be used for any other service, but you shall in no way eat of
      it. '
    25: '²⁵ For whoever eats the fat of the animal which men offer as an offering
      made by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his
      people. '
    26: '²⁶ You shall not eat any blood, whether it is of bird or of animal, in any
      of your dwellings. '
    27: "²⁷ Whoever it is who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his\

      sacrifice of his peace offerings. '
    30: '³⁰ With his own hands he shall bring the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.
      He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved for a wave
      offering before Yahweh. '
    31: '³¹ The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron’s
      and his sons’. '
    32: '³² The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out
      of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. '
    33: '³³ He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings,
      and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. '
    34: "³⁴ For the waved breast and the heaved thigh I have taken from the children\
      \ of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them\
      \ to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their portion forever from the children\
      \ of Israel.’” \n"
    35: '³⁵ This is the consecrated portion of Aaron, and the consecrated portion
      of his sons, out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, in the day when he
      presented them to minister to Yahweh in the priest’s office; '
    36: '³⁶ which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in
      the day that he anointed them. It is their portion forever throughout their
      generations. '
    37: '³⁷ This is the law of the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering,
      the trespass offering, the consecration, and the sacrifice of peace offerings '
    38: ³⁸ which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai in the day that he commanded
      the children of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh, in the wilderness
      of Sinai.
  8:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil,
      and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened
      bread; '
    3: "³ and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at
      the door of the Tent of Meeting. '
    5: '⁵ Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded
      to be done.” '
    6: '⁶ Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. '
    7: '⁷ He put the tunic on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe,
      put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod on
      him and fastened it to him with it. '
    8: '⁸ He placed the breastplate on him. He put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate. '
    9: '⁹ He set the turban on his head. He set the golden plate, the holy crown,
      on the front of the turban, as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that
      was in it, and sanctified them. '
    11: '¹¹ He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all
      its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them. '
    12: '¹² He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him,
      to sanctify him. '
    13: "¹³ Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and tied sashes\
      \ on them, and put headbands on them, as Yahweh commanded Moses. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their
      hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. '
    15: '¹⁵ He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it around on the horns
      of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood
      at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. '
    16: '¹⁶ He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver,
      and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it on the altar. '
    17: '¹⁷ But the bull, and its skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burned with
      fire outside the camp, as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    18: '¹⁸ He presented the ram of the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their
      hands on the head of the ram. '
    19: '¹⁹ He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar. '
    20: '²⁰ He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head, and the pieces,
      and the fat. '
    21: '²¹ He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses burned the whole
      ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering
      made by fire to Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    22: '²² He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration. Aaron and his sons
      laid their hands on the head of the ram. '
    23: '²³ He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip
      of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe
      of his right foot. '
    24: '²⁴ He brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of
      their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe
      of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar. '
    25: '²⁵ He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the innards, the
      cover of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh; '
    26: '²⁶ and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Yahweh, he took
      one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them
      on the fat and on the right thigh. '
    27: '²⁷ He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them
      for a wave offering before Yahweh. '
    28: '²⁸ Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the
      burnt offering. They were a consecration offering for a pleasant aroma. It was
      an offering made by fire to Yahweh. '
    29: '²⁹ Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh.
      It was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration, as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    30: "³⁰ Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was\
      \ on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons,\
      \ and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and\
      \ his sons, and his sons’ garments with him. \n"
    31: '³¹ Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the
      Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration,
      as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ '
    32: '³² What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire. '
    33: '³³ You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days,
      until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you
      seven days. '
    34: '³⁴ What has been done today, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement
      for you. '
    35: '³⁵ You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven
      days, and keep Yahweh’s command, that you don’t die: for so I am commanded.” '
    36: ³⁶ Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.
  9:
    1: '¹ On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; '
    2: '² and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and
      a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Yahweh. '
    3: '³ You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for
      a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for
      a burnt offering; '
    4: "⁴ and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and\
      \ a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation
      came near and stood before Yahweh. '
    6: '⁶ Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do;
      and Yahweh’s glory shall appear to you.” '
    7: "⁷ Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering,\
      \ and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people;\
      \ and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh\
      \ commanded.” \n"
    8: '⁸ So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering,
      which was for himself. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in
      the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at
      the base of the altar; '
    10: '¹⁰ but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin
      offering, he burned upon the altar, as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    11: '¹¹ The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp. '
    12: '¹² He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to
      him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. '
    13: '¹³ They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head.
      He burned them upon the altar. '
    14: '¹⁴ He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering
      on the altar. '
    15: '¹⁵ He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering
      which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first. '
    16: '¹⁶ He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. '
    17: '¹⁷ He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned
      it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning. '
    18: '¹⁸ He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings,
      which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he
      sprinkled around on the altar; '
    19: '¹⁹ and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers
      the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver; '
    20: '²⁰ and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar. '
    21: '²¹ Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before
      Yahweh, as Moses commanded. '
    22: "²² Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he\
      \ came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the\
      \ peace offerings. \n"
    23: '²³ Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed
      the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people. '
    24: ²⁴ Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the
      fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their
      faces.
  10:
    1: '¹ Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in
      it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he
      had not commanded them. '
    2: "² Fire came out from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before\
      \ Yahweh. \n"
    3: "³ Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying,\n‘I will\
      \ show myself holy to those who come near me,\n    and before all the people\
      \ I will be glorified.’”\nAaron held his peace. "
    4: '⁴ Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron,
      and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary
      out of the camp.” '
    5: "⁵ So they came near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as\
      \ Moses had said. \n"
    6: '⁶ Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let
      the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes, so that you don’t
      die, and so that he will not be angry with all the congregation; but let your
      brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled. '
    7: '⁷ You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die;
      for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.” They did according to the word of
      Moses. '
    8: '⁸ Then Yahweh said to Aaron, '
    9: '⁹ “You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink whenever you go
      into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This shall be a statute forever throughout
      your generations. '
    10: '¹⁰ You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between
      the unclean and the clean. '
    11: "¹¹ You are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh\
      \ has spoken to them by Moses.” \n"
    12: '¹² Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were
      left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by
      fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy; '
    13: '¹³ and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and
      your sons’ portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; for so I am commanded. '
    14: '¹⁴ The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place,
      you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your
      portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings
      of the children of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ They shall bring the heaved thigh and the waved breast with the offerings\
      \ made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It\
      \ shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever, as Yahweh has\
      \ commanded.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,
      it was burned. He was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron
      who were left, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary,
      since it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the
      congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh? '
    18: "¹⁸ Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary.\
      \ You certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering\
      \ and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened\
      \ to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing\
      \ in Yahweh’s sight?” \n"
    20: ²⁰ When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.
  11:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the living things which
      you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth. '
    3: "³ Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and chews the cud among the\
      \ animals, that you may eat. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud, or of
      those who part the hoof: the camel, because it chews the cud but doesn’t have
      a parted hoof, is unclean to you. '
    5: '⁵ The hyrax, because it chews the cud but doesn’t have a parted hoof, is unclean
      to you. '
    6: '⁶ The hare, because it chews the cud but doesn’t have a parted hoof, is unclean
      to you. '
    7: '⁷ The pig, because it has a split hoof, and is cloven-footed, but doesn’t
      chew the cud, is unclean to you. '
    8: "⁸ You shall not eat their meat. You shall not touch their carcasses. They\
      \ are unclean to you. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘You may eat of all these that are in the waters: whatever has fins and
      scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that you may eat. '
    10: '¹⁰ All that don’t have fins and scales in the seas and rivers, all that move
      in the waters, and all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are
      an abomination to you, '
    11: '¹¹ and you shall detest them. You shall not eat of their meat, and you shall
      detest their carcasses. '

    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears
      a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly
      period she shall be unclean. '
    3: '³ In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. '
    4: '⁴ She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall
      not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her
      purifying are completed. '
    5: "⁵ But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as\
      \ in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six\
      \ days. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter,
      she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old
      lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove, for a sin offering. '
    7: "⁷ He shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; then she shall\

      \ bears, whether a male or a female. "
    8: '⁸ If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two
      young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering.
      The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”'
  13:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, '
    2: '² “When a man shall have a swelling in his body’s skin, or a scab, or a bright
      spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy, then he
      shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests. '
    3: '³ The priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body. If the hair
      in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than
      the body’s skin, it is the plague of leprosy; so the priest shall examine him
      and pronounce him unclean. '
    4: '⁴ If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance
      isn’t deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn’t turned white, then the priest
      shall isolate the infected person for seven days. '
    5: '⁵ The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. Behold, if in his eyes
      the plague is arrested and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest
      shall isolate him for seven more days. '
    6: '⁶ The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day. Behold, if the plague
      has faded and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce
      him clean. It is a scab. He shall wash his clothes, and be clean. '
    7: '⁷ But if the scab spreads on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest
      for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. '
    8: "⁸ The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the\

    9: '⁹ “When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the
      priest; '
    10: '¹⁰ and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white swelling
      in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the
      swelling, '
    11: "¹¹ it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall\

    12: '¹² “If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all
      the skin of the infected person from his head even to his feet, as far as it
      appears to the priest, '

      white: he is clean. '
    14: '¹⁴ But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the

      come to the priest. '
    17: "¹⁷ The priest shall examine him. Behold, if the plague has turned white,\

      It is a plague. '
    23: "²³ But if the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn’t spread, it is the\
      \ scar from the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin, and the raw flesh
      of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white, '
    25: '²⁵ then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair in the bright
      spot has turned white, and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy.
      It has broken out in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean.
      It is the plague of leprosy. '
    26: '²⁶ But if the priest examines it, and behold, there is no white hair in the
      bright spot, and it isn’t deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest
      shall isolate him seven days. '
    27: '²⁷ The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it has spread in the
      skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. '
    28: "²⁸ If the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn’t spread in the skin,\
      \ but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce\
      \ him clean, for it is the scar from the burn. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “When a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard, '
    30: '³⁰ then the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if its appearance
      is deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest
      shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch. It is leprosy of the head or of
      the beard. '
    31: '³¹ If the priest examines the plague of itching, and behold, its appearance
      isn’t deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest
      shall isolate the person infected with itching seven days. '
    32: '³² On the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if
      the itch hasn’t spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the appearance

      shall isolate the one who has the itch seven more days. '
    34: '³⁴ On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the itch; and behold, if
      the itch hasn’t spread in the skin, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the
      skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and
      be clean. '
    35: '³⁵ But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing, '
    36: '³⁶ then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the itch has spread
      in the skin, the priest shall not look for the yellow hair; he is unclean. '
    37: "³⁷ But if in his eyes the itch is arrested and black hair has grown in it,\
      \ then the itch is healed. He is clean. The priest shall pronounce him clean.\

    38: '³⁸ “When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body, even
      white bright spots, '
    39: "³⁹ then the priest shall examine them. Behold, if the bright spots on the\
      \ skin of their body are a dull white, it is a harmless rash. It has broken\
      \ out in the skin. He is clean. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ “If a man’s hair has fallen from his head, he is bald. He is clean. '
    41: '⁴¹ If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead
      bald. He is clean. '
    42: '⁴² But if a reddish-white plague is in the bald head or the bald forehead,
      it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head or his bald forehead. '
    43: '⁴³ Then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the swelling of the plague
      is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance
      of leprosy in the skin of the body, '
    44: "⁴⁴ he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce\
      \ him unclean. His plague is on his head. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ “The leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes, and the hair
      of his head shall hang loose. He shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, ‘Unclean!
      Unclean!’ '
    46: "⁴⁶ All the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean. He is\

    48: '⁴⁸ whether it is in warp or woof; of linen or of wool; whether in a leather,
      or in anything made of leather; '
    49: '⁴⁹ if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the leather,
      or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of leather; it is the plague
      of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest. '
    50: '⁵⁰ The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the plague seven days. '
    51: '⁵¹ He shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread
      in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever
      use the skin is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew. It is unclean. '
    52: "⁵² He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in\
      \ linen, or anything of leather, in which the plague is, for it is a destructive\
      \ mildew. It shall be burned in the fire. \n"
    53: '⁵³ “If the priest examines it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the
      garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; '
    54: '⁵⁴ then the priest shall command that they wash the thing that the plague
      is in, and he shall isolate it seven more days. '
    55: '⁵⁵ Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed; and behold,
      if the plague hasn’t changed its color, and the plague hasn’t spread, it is
      unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness
      is inside or outside. '
    56: '⁵⁶ If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after it is washed,
      then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the
      warp, or out of the woof; '
    57: '⁵⁷ and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
      woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn what the plague
      is in with fire. '
    58: "⁵⁸ The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it\
      \ is, which you shall wash, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall\
      \ be washed the second time, and it will be clean.” \n"
    59: ⁵⁹ This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool or linen,
      either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin, to pronounce it clean,
      or to pronounce it unclean.
  14:
    1: "¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, \n"

  21:
    1: '¹ Yahweh said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say
      to them, ‘A priest shall not defile himself for the dead among his people, '
    2: '² except for his relatives that are near to him: for his mother, for his father,
      for his son, for his daughter, for his brother, '
    3: '³ and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband; for
      her he may defile himself. '
    4: "⁴ He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane\
      \ himself. \n"
    5: '⁵ “‘They shall not shave their heads or shave off the corners of their beards
      or make any cuttings in their flesh. '
    6: "⁶ They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God,\
      \ for they offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, the bread of their God.\
      \ Therefore they shall be holy. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane. A priest
      shall not marry a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God. '
    8: "⁸ Therefore you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He\
      \ shall be holy to you, for I Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy. \n"
    9: "⁹ “‘The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute,\
      \ she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing
      oil is poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let
      the hair of his head hang loose, or tear his clothes. '
    11: '¹¹ He must not go in to any dead body, or defile himself for his father or
      for his mother. '
    12: "¹² He shall not go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his\
      \ God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am Yahweh.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘He shall take a wife in her virginity. '
    14: '¹⁴ He shall not marry a widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled,
      or a prostitute. He shall take a virgin of his own people as a wife. '
    15: "¹⁵ He shall not profane his offspring among his people, for I am Yahweh who\

    16: '¹⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Say to Aaron, ‘None of your offspring throughout their generations who
      has a defect may approach to offer the bread of his God. '
    18: '¹⁸ For whatever man he is that has a defect, he shall not draw near: a blind
      man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or any deformity, '
    19: '¹⁹ or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand, '
    20: '²⁰ or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye, or an
      itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles. '
    21: '²¹ No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come
      near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Since he has a defect, he
      shall not come near to offer the bread of his God. '
    22: '²² He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. '
    23: "²³ He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because\
      \ he has a defect; that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who\
      \ sanctifies them.’” \n"
    24: ²⁴ So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
  22:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of\
      \ the children of Israel, which they make holy to me, and that they not profane\
      \ my holy name. I am Yahweh. \n"
    3: "³ “Tell them, ‘If anyone of all your offspring throughout your generations\
      \ approaches the holy things which the children of Israel make holy to Yahweh,\
      \ having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me.\
      \ I am Yahweh. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘Whoever of the offspring of Aaron is a leper or has a discharge shall
      not eat of the holy things until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that
      is unclean by the dead, or a man who has a seminal emission, '
    5: '⁵ or whoever touches any creeping thing whereby he may be made unclean, or
      a man from whom he may become unclean, whatever uncleanness he has— '
    6: '⁶ the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening, and
      shall not eat of the holy things unless he bathes his body in water. '
    7: '⁷ When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the
      holy things, because it is his bread. '
    8: "⁸ He shall not eat that which dies of itself or is torn by animals, defiling\
      \ himself by it. I am Yahweh. \n"
    9: "⁹ “‘They shall therefore follow my commandment, lest they bear sin for it\
      \ and die in it, if they profane it. I am Yahweh who sanctifies them. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘No stranger shall eat of the holy thing: a foreigner living with the
      priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. '
    11: '¹¹ But if a priest buys a slave, purchased by his money, he shall eat of
      it; and those who are born in his house shall eat of his bread. '
    12: '¹² If a priest’s daughter is married to an outsider, she shall not eat of
      the heave offering of the holy things. '
    13: "¹³ But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child,\
      \ and has returned to her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat of her\
      \ father’s bread; but no stranger shall eat any of it. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘If a man eats something holy unwittingly, then he shall add the fifth
      part of its value to it, and shall give the holy thing to the priest. '
    15: '¹⁵ The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,
      which they offer to Yahweh, '
    16: "¹⁶ and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat\
      \ their holy things; for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.’” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and
      say to them, ‘Whoever is of the house of Israel, or of the foreigners in Israel,
      who offers his offering, whether it is any of their vows or any of their free
      will offerings, which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt offering: '
    19: '¹⁹ that you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without defect, of the
      bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats. '
    20: '²⁰ But you shall not offer whatever has a defect, for it shall not be acceptable
      for you. '
    21: '²¹ Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh to accomplish
      a vow, or for a free will offering of the herd or of the flock, it shall be
      perfect to be accepted. It shall have no defect. '
    22: '²² You shall not offer what is blind, is injured, is maimed, has a wart,
      is festering, or has a running sore to Yahweh, nor make an offering by fire
      of them on the altar to Yahweh. '
    23: '²³ Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts,
      that you may offer for a free will offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. '
    24: '²⁴ You must not offer to Yahweh that which has its testicles bruised, crushed,
      broken, or cut. You must not do this in your land. '
    25: "²⁵ You must not offer any of these as the bread of your God from the hand\
      \ of a foreigner, because their corruption is in them. There is a defect in\
      \ them. They shall not be accepted for you.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “When a bull, a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with
      its mother. From the eighth day on it shall be accepted for the offering of
      an offering made by fire to Yahweh. '
    28: "²⁸ Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in\
      \ one day. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, you shall sacrifice
      it so that you may be accepted. '
    30: "³⁰ It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the\
      \ morning. I am Yahweh. \n"
    31: '³¹ “Therefore you shall keep my commandments, and do them. I am Yahweh. '
    32: '³² You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be made holy among the
      children of Israel. I am Yahweh who makes you holy, '
    33: ³³ who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am Yahweh.”
  23:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The set feasts of Yahweh,\
      \ which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “‘Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn\
      \ rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no kind of work. It is a Sabbath to\
      \ Yahweh in all your dwellings. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you
      shall proclaim in their appointed season. '
    5: '⁵ In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is
      Yahweh’s Passover. '
    6: '⁶ On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread
      to Yahweh. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. '
    7: '⁷ In the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular
      work. '
    8: "⁸ But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days. In the\
      \ seventh day is a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.’” \n"
    9: '⁹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into
      the land which I give to you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring
      the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. '
    11: '¹¹ He shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you. On the
      next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. '
    12: '¹² On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without
      defect a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh. '
    13: '¹³ The meal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour
      mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a pleasant aroma; and
      the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. '
    14: "¹⁴ You must not eat bread, or roasted grain, or fresh grain, until this same\
      \ day, until you have brought the offering of your God. This is a statute forever\
      \ throughout your generations in all your dwellings. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “‘You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that
      you brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall be completed. '
    16: '¹⁶ The next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall count fifty days; and
      you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave
      offering made of two tenths of an ephah of fine flour. They shall be baked with
      yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall present with the bread seven lambs without defect a year old,
      one young bull, and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with
      their meal offering and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire,
      of a sweet aroma to Yahweh. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a
      year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings. '
    20: '²⁰ The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave
      offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to Yahweh for
      the priest. '
    21: "²¹ You shall make proclamation on the same day that there shall be a holy\
      \ convocation to you. You shall do no regular work. This is a statute forever\
      \ in all your dwellings throughout your generations. \n"
    22: "²² “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not wholly reap into\
      \ the corners of your field, and you must not gather the gleanings of your harvest.\
      \ You must leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am Yahweh your\
      \ God.’” \n"
    23: '²³ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the
      first day of the month, there shall be a solemn rest for you, a memorial of
      blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. '
    25: "²⁵ You shall do no regular work. You shall offer an offering made by fire\
      \ to Yahweh.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement.
      It shall be a holy convocation to you. You shall afflict yourselves and you
      shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. '
    28: '²⁸ You shall do no kind of work in that same day, for it is a day of atonement,
      to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God. '
    29: '²⁹ For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day shall be
      cut off from his people. '
    30: '³⁰ Whoever does any kind of work in that same day, I will destroy that person
      from among his people. '
    31: '³¹ You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your
      generations in all your dwellings. '
    32: "³² It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves.\
      \ In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall\
      \ keep your Sabbath.” \n"
    33: '³³ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    34: '³⁴ “Speak to the children of Israel, and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this
      seventh month is the feast of booths for seven days to Yahweh. '
    35: '³⁵ On the first day shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no regular
      work. '
    36: "³⁶ Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. On the\
      \ eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you. You shall offer an offering\
      \ made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ “‘These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh which you shall proclaim to
      be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering,
      a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day— '
    38: "³⁸ in addition to the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and in addition to your gifts,\
      \ and in addition to all your vows, and in addition to all your free will offerings,\
      \ which you give to Yahweh. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “‘So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered
      in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days. On
      the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn
      rest. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You shall take on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, branches
      of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you
      shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days. '
    41: '⁴¹ You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a
      statute forever throughout your generations. You shall keep it in the seventh
      month. '
    42: '⁴² You shall dwell in temporary shelters for seven days. All who are native-born
      in Israel shall dwell in temporary shelters, '
    43: "⁴³ that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell\
      \ in temporary shelters when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh\
      \ your God.’” \n"
    44: ⁴⁴ So Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.
  24:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten
      for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. '
    3: '³ Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall
      keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually. It shall
      be a statute forever throughout your generations. '
    4: "⁴ He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh\
      \ continually. \n"
    5: '⁵ “You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of an
      ephah shall be in one cake. '
    6: '⁶ You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before
      Yahweh. '
    7: '⁷ You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread
      for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh. '
    8: '⁸ Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It
      is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children of Israel. '
    9: "⁹ It shall be for Aaron and his sons. They shall eat it in a holy place; for\
      \ it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual\
      \ statute.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out
      among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of
      Israel strove together in the camp. '
    11: '¹¹ The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they
      brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri,
      of the tribe of Dan. '
    12: '¹² They put him in custody until Yahweh’s will should be declared to them. '
    13: '¹³ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ “Bring him who cursed out of the camp; and let all who heard him lay their
      hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. '
    15: '¹⁵ You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his
      God shall bear his sin. '
    16: "¹⁶ He who blasphemes Yahweh’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All\
      \ the congregation shall certainly stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born\
      \ shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death. '
    18: '¹⁸ He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life. '
    19: '¹⁹ If anyone injures his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he has done: '
    20: '²⁰ fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. It shall be done
      to him as he has injured someone. '
    21: '²¹ He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall
      be put to death. '
    22: "²² You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born;\
      \ for I am Yahweh your God.’” \n"
    23: ²³ Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed
      out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh
      commanded Moses.
  25:
    1: '¹ Yahweh said to Moses on Mount Sinai, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the
      land which I give you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh. '
    3: '³ You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six
      years, and gather in its fruits; '
    4: '⁴ but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the
      land, a Sabbath to Yahweh. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard. '
    5: '⁵ What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not
      gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest
      for the land. '
    6: '⁶ The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your
      servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives
      as a foreigner with you. '
    7: "⁷ For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall\
      \ all its increase be for food. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years;
      and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine
      years. '
    9: '⁹ Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month.
      On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout

      your neighbor. According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to
      you. '
    16: '¹⁶ According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and
      according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price; for he
      is selling the number of the crops to you. '

    19: '¹⁹ The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell
      therein in safety. '
    20: '²⁰ If you said, “What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not
      sow, nor gather in our increase;” '
    21: '²¹ then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall
      bear fruit for the three years. '

      has sold. '
    26: '²⁶ If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds
      sufficient means to redeem it, '
    27: '²⁷ then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus
      to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his property. '
    28: "²⁸ But if he isn’t able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold\

      it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have
      the right of redemption. '
    30: '³⁰ If it isn’t redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that
      is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it,

    31: "³¹ But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be\

    32: '³² “‘Nevertheless, in the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem the
      houses in the cities of their possession at any time. '
    33: '³³ The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession,
      and it shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the
      Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. '
    34: "³⁴ But the field of the pasture lands of their cities may not be sold, for\
      \ it is their perpetual possession. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “‘If your brother has become poor, and his hand can’t support himself

    41: '⁴¹ Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall
      return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers. '
    42: '⁴² For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They

    51: '⁵¹ If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the
      price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. '
    52: '⁵² If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall
      reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price
      of his redemption. '

    46: ⁴⁶ These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws, which Yahweh made between
      him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.
  27:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When a man consecrates
      a person to Yahweh in a vow, according to your valuation, '
    3: '³ your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall
      be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. '
    4: '⁴ If she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. '
    5: '⁵ If the person is from five years old to twenty years old, then your valuation
      shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. '
    6: '⁶ If the person is from a month old to five years old, then your valuation
      shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation
      shall be three shekels of silver. '
    7: '⁷ If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then
      your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. '
    8: "⁸ But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the\
      \ priest, and the priest shall assign a value to him. The priest shall assign\
      \ a value according to his ability to pay. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that
      any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy. '
    10: '¹⁰ He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for
      a good. If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then both it and that
      for which it is exchanged shall be holy. '
    11: '¹¹ If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering
      to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest; '
    12: '¹² and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest
      evaluates it, so it shall be. '
    13: "¹³ But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it\
      \ to its valuation. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest
      shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so
      it shall stand. '
    15: "¹⁵ If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth\
      \ part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then
      your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. The sowing of a homer
      of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. '
    17: '¹⁷ If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your
      valuation it shall stand. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall
      reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee;
      and an abatement shall be made from your valuation. '
    19: '¹⁹ If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add
      the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his. '
    20: '²⁰ If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another
      man, it shall not be redeemed any more; '
    21: "²¹ but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh,\
      \ as a devoted field. It shall be owned by the priests. \n"
    22: '²² “‘If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought, which is not
      of the field of his possession, '
    23: '²³ then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to
      the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy
      thing to Yahweh. '
    24: '²⁴ In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was
      bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs. '
    25: "²⁵ All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary:\
      \ twenty gerahs to the shekel. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “‘However the firstborn among animals, which belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn,
      no man may dedicate, whether an ox or a sheep. It is Yahweh’s. '
    27: "²⁷ If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your\
      \ valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it isn’t redeemed,\
      \ then it shall be sold according to your valuation. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man devotes to Yahweh of all\
      \ that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession,\
      \ shall be sold or redeemed. Everything that is permanently devoted is most\
      \ holy to Yahweh. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “‘No one devoted to destruction, who shall be devoted from among men,\
      \ shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “‘All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the
      fruit of the trees, is Yahweh’s. It is holy to Yahweh. '
    31: '³¹ If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it. '
    32: '³² All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod,
      the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh. '
    33: "³³ He shall not examine whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange\
      \ it. If he exchanges it at all, then both it and that for which it is exchanged\
      \ shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’” \n"
    34: ³⁴ These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children
      of Israel on Mount Sinai.
