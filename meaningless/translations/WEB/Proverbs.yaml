    20: "²⁰ Wisdom calls aloud in the street.\n    She utters her voice in the public\
      \ squares.\n"
    21: "²¹ She calls at the head of noisy places.\n    At the entrance of the city\
      \ gates, she utters her words:\n"

      \ mockers delight themselves in mockery,\n    and fools hate knowledge?\n"
    23: "²³ Turn at my reproof.\n    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.\n \

    28: "²⁸ Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.\n    They will seek\
      \ me diligently, but they will not find me,\n"
    29: "²⁹ because they hated knowledge,\n    and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.\n"
    30: "³⁰ They wanted none of my counsel.\n    They despised all my reproof.\n"
    31: "³¹ Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,\n    and be filled\
      \ with their own schemes.\n"
    32: "³² For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.\n    The careless ease\
      \ of fools will destroy them.\n"
