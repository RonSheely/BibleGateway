      his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the
      Testimony, from between the two cherubim; and he spoke to him.
  8:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Speak to Aaron, and tell him, ‘When you light the lamps, the seven lamps\
      \ shall give light in front of the lamp stand.’” \n"
    3: '³ Aaron did so. He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lamp stand,
      as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    4: "⁴ This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold. From its\
      \ base to its flowers, it was beaten work. He made the lamp stand according\
      \ to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses. \n"
    5: '⁵ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. '
    7: '⁷ You shall do this to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing
      on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let them wash their
      clothes, and cleanse themselves. '
    8: '⁸ Then let them take a young bull and its meal offering, fine flour mixed
      with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering. '
    9: '⁹ You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble
      the whole congregation of the children of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall present the Levites before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall
      lay their hands on the Levites, '
    11: "¹¹ and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering on\
      \ the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service\

    12: '¹² “The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you
      shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to
      Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites. '
    13: '¹³ You shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer
      them as a wave offering to Yahweh. '
    14: "¹⁴ Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel,\
      \ and the Levites shall be mine. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of

    16: '¹⁶ For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead

      I have taken them to me. '
    17: '¹⁷ For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man
      and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
      I sanctified them for myself. '
    18: '¹⁸ I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children

    20: '²⁰ Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did

      Levites, so the children of Israel did to them. '
    21: '²¹ The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes;
      and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh and Aaron made atonement
      for them to cleanse them. '
    22: "²² After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting\
      \ before Aaron and before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning\
      \ the Levites, so they did to them. \n"
    23: '²³ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “This is what is assigned to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and
      upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting; '
    25: '²⁵ and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from doing the work,
      and shall serve no more, '
    26: ²⁶ but shall assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the
      duty, and shall perform no service. This is how you shall have the Levites do
      their duties.”
  9:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of
      the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, '
    2: '² “Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season. '
    3: "³ On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its\
      \ appointed season. You shall keep it according to all its statutes and according\
      \ to all its ordinances.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. '
    5: '⁵ They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the
      month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded
      Moses, so the children of Israel did. '
    6: '⁶ There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man,
      so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses
      and Aaron on that day. '
    7: "⁷ Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man.\
      \ Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its\
      \ appointed season among the children of Israel?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning\
      \ you.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations
      is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still
      keep the Passover to Yahweh. '
    11: '¹¹ In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep
      it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. '
    12: '¹² They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it.
      According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. '
    13: "¹³ But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the\
      \ Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer\
      \ the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “‘If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to\
      \ Yahweh, then he shall do so according to the statute of the Passover, and\
      \ according to its ordinance. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner,\
      \ and for him who is born in the land.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle,
      even the Tent of the Testimony. At evening it was over the tabernacle, as it
      were the appearance of fire, until morning. '
    16: '¹⁶ So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire
      by night. '
    17: '¹⁷ Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the
      children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there
      the children of Israel encamped. '
    18: '¹⁸ At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at
      the commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the
      tabernacle they remained encamped. '
    19: '¹⁹ When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of
      Israel kept Yahweh’s command, and didn’t travel. '
    20: '²⁰ Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to
      the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment
      of Yahweh they traveled. '
    21: '²¹ Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud
      was taken up in the morning, they traveled; or by day and by night, when the
      cloud was taken up, they traveled. '
    22: '²² Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on
      the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and
      didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled. '
    23: ²³ At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh
      they traveled. They kept Yahweh’s command, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
  10:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall
      use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the
      camps. '
    3: '³ When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you
      at the door of the Tent of Meeting. '
    4: '⁴ If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel,
      shall gather themselves to you. '
    5: '⁵ When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward. '
    6: '⁶ When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south
      side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys. '
    7: "⁷ But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you\
      \ shall not sound an alarm. \n"
    8: '⁸ “The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be
      to you for a statute forever throughout your generations. '
    9: "⁹ When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you,\
      \ then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered\
      \ before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the\
      \ beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings,\
      \ and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you\
      \ for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month,
      the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the covenant. '
    12: '¹² The children of Israel went forward on their journeys out of the wilderness
      of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran. '
    13: "¹³ They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward
      according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army. '
    15: '¹⁵ Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children
      of Issachar. '
    16: '¹⁶ Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children
      of Zebulun. '
    17: '¹⁷ The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of
      Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward. '
    18: '¹⁸ The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies.
      Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army. '
    19: '¹⁹ Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the
      children of Simeon. '
    20: "²⁰ Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children\
      \ of Gad. \n"
    21: "²¹ The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the\
      \ tabernacle before they arrived. \n"
    22: '²² The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according
      to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army. '
    23: '²³ Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children
      of Manasseh. '
    24: "²⁴ Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children\
      \ of Benjamin. \n"
    25: '²⁵ The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard
      of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of

      of Asher. '
    27: '²⁷ Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of
      Naphtali. '
    28: "²⁸ Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies;\
      \ and they went forward. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law,\
      \ “We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you.’\
      \ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning\

    32: "³² It shall be, if you go with us—yes, it shall be—that whatever good Yahweh\
      \ does to us, we will do the same to you.” \n"
    33: '³³ They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey. The ark
      of Yahweh’s covenant went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting
      place for them. '
    34: '³⁴ The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the
      camp. '
    35: '³⁵ When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and let your
      enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!” '
    36: ³⁶ When it rested, he said, “Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands
      of Israel.”
  11:
    1: '¹ The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it,
      his anger burned; and Yahweh’s fire burned among them, and consumed some of
      the outskirts of the camp. '
    2: '² The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated. '
    3: "³ The name of that place was called Taberah, because Yahweh’s fire burned\
      \ among them. \n"
    4: '⁴ The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the children
      of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat? '
    5: '⁵ We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers,
      and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; '
    6: '⁶ but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna
      to look at.” '
    7: '⁷ The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium. '
    8: '⁸ The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it
      in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like
      the taste of fresh oil. '
    9: "⁹ When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at
      the door of his tent; and Yahweh’s anger burned greatly; and Moses was displeased. '
    11: '¹¹ Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why
      haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people
      on me? '
    12: '¹² Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should
      tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to
      the land which you swore to their fathers?’ '
    13: '¹³ Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before
      me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ '
    14: '¹⁴ I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for
      me. '
    15: "¹⁵ If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor\
      \ in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel,
      whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring
      them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. '
    17: "¹⁷ I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which\
      \ is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the\
      \ people with you, that you don’t bear it yourself alone. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow,
      and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who
      will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore Yahweh
      will give you meat, and you will eat. '
    19: '¹⁹ You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days,
      or twenty days, '
    20: "²⁰ but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome\
      \ to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before\

    21: '²¹ Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men
      on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole
      month.’ '
    22: "²² Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them?\
      \ Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient\
      \ for them?” \n"
    23: "²³ Yahweh said to Moses, “Has Yahweh’s hand grown short? Now you will see\
      \ whether my word will happen to you or not.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and he gathered seventy
      men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent. '
    25: '²⁵ Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit
      that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on
      them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. '
    26: '²⁶ But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name
      of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were
      written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. '
    27: "²⁷ A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying\
      \ in the camp!” \n"
    28: "²⁸ Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered,\
      \ “My lord Moses, forbid them!” \n"
    29: "²⁹ Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh’s\
      \ people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!” \n"
    30: '³⁰ Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. '
    31: '³¹ A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them
      fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on
      the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the
      earth. '
    32: '³² The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next
      day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and
      they spread them all out for themselves around the camp. '
    33: '³³ While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh’s
      anger burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great
      plague. '
    34: "³⁴ The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they\
      \ buried the people who lusted. \n"
    35: ³⁵ From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed
      at Hazeroth.
  12:
    1: '¹ Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he
      had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. '
    2: "² They said, “Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn’t he spoken also\
      \ with us?” And Yahweh heard it. \n"
    3: '³ Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were on the
      surface of the earth. '
    4: "⁴ Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, “You three come\
      \ out to the Tent of Meeting!”\nThe three of them came out. "
    5: '⁵ Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent,
      and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. '
    6: '⁶ He said, “Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh,
      will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream. '
    7: '⁷ My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. '
    8: '⁸ With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles;
      and he shall see Yahweh’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against
      my servant, against Moses?” '
    9: "⁹ Yahweh’s anger burned against them; and he departed. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous,\
      \ as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against
      us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. '
    12: "¹² Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed\
      \ when he comes out of his mother’s womb.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn’t\
      \ she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days,\
      \ and after that she shall be brought in again.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t
      travel until Miriam was brought in again. '
    16: ¹⁶ Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness
      of Paran.
  13:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the\
      \ children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man,\
      \ every one a prince among them.” \n"
    3: '³ Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment
      of Yahweh. All of them were men who were heads of the children of Israel. '
    4: "⁴ These were their names:\nOf the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. \n"
    6: "⁶ Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. \n"
    7: "⁷ Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. \n"
    8: "⁸ Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. \n"
    9: "⁹ Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. \n"
    13: "¹³ Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses
      called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up
      this way by the South, and go up into the hill country. '
    18: '¹⁸ See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they
      are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; '
    19: '¹⁹ and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and
      what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; '
    20: "²⁰ and what the land is, whether it is fertile or poor, whether there is\
      \ wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.”\
      \ Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes. \n"
    21: '²¹ So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to
      Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath. '
    22: '²² They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and
      Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years
      before Zoan in Egypt.) '
    23: '²³ They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with
      one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought
      some of the pomegranates and figs. '
    24: '²⁴ That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which
      the children of Israel cut down from there. '
    25: '²⁵ They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. '
    26: '²⁶ They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of
      the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back
      word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the
      land. '
    27: '²⁷ They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely
      it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. '
    28: '²⁸ However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are
      fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. '
    29: "²⁹ Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and\
      \ the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and\
      \ along the side of the Jordan.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once,\
      \ and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!” \n"
    31: '³¹ But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against
      the people; for they are stronger than we.” '
    32: '³² They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to
      the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy
      it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw
      in it are men of great stature. '
    33: ³³ There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim.
      We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”
  14:
    1: '¹ All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept
      that night. '
    2: '² All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The
      whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt,
      or that we had died in this wilderness! '
    3: '³ Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and
      our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to
      return into Egypt?” '
    4: "⁴ They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into\
      \ Egypt.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the\
      \ congregation of the children of Israel. \n"
    6: '⁶ Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those
      who spied out the land, tore their clothes. '
    7: '⁷ They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The
      land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. '
    8: '⁸ If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give
      it to us: a land which flows with milk and honey. '
    9: "⁹ Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for\
      \ they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh\
      \ is with us. Don’t fear them.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones.\nYahweh’s\
      \ glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel. "
    11: '¹¹ Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? How long
      will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them? '
    12: "¹² I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will\
      \ make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought
      up this people in your might from among them. '
    14: '¹⁴ They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that
      you Yahweh are among this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and
      your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by
      day, and in a pillar of fire by night. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have
      heard the fame of you will speak, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which
      he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.’ '
    17: '¹⁷ Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken,
      saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity
      and disobedience; and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity
      of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’ '
    19: "¹⁹ Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of\
      \ your loving kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt\
      \ even until now.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Yahweh said, “I have pardoned according to your word; '
    21: '²¹ but in very deed—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with
      Yahweh’s glory— '
    22: '²² because all those men who have seen my glory and my signs, which I worked
      in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have
      not listened to my voice; '
    23: '²³ surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither
      shall any of those who despised me see it. '
    24: '²⁴ But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has
      followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring
      shall possess it. '
    25: '²⁵ Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn
      and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” '
    26: '²⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that complain against
      me? I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel, which they complain
      against me. '
    28: '²⁸ Tell them, ‘As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears,
      so I will do to you. '
    29: '²⁹ Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted
      of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who
      have complained against me, '
    30: '³⁰ surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore that
      I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua
      the son of Nun. '
    31: '³¹ But I will bring in your little ones that you said should be captured
      or killed, and they shall know the land which you have rejected. '
    32: '³² But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. '
    33: '³³ Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall
      bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness. '
    34: '³⁴ After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty
      days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years,
      and you will know my alienation.’ '
    35: "³⁵ I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation\
      \ who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed,\
      \ and there they shall die.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all
      the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against
      the land, '
    37: '³⁷ even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the
      plague before Yahweh. '
    38: "³⁸ But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive\
      \ of those men who went to spy out the land. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned
      greatly. '
    40: "⁴⁰ They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain,\
      \ saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has\
      \ promised; for we have sinned.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Moses said, “Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it
      shall not prosper? '
    42: '⁴² Don’t go up, for Yahweh isn’t among you; that way you won’t be struck
      down before your enemies. '
    43: "⁴³ For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will\
      \ fall by the sword because you turned back from following Yahweh; therefore\
      \ Yahweh will not be with you.” \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the
      ark of Yahweh’s covenant and Moses didn’t depart out of the camp. '
    45: ⁴⁵ Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain,
      and struck them and beat them down even to Hormah.
  15:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into
      the land of your habitations, which I give to you, '
    3: '³ and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh—a burnt offering, or a sacrifice,
      to accomplish a vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts, to make
      a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock— '
    4: '⁴ then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of
      one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one fourth of a hin of oil. '
    5: "⁵ You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one fourth of a hin, with\
      \ the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘For a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah
      of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil; '
    7: '⁷ and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine,
      of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. '
    8: '⁸ When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to accomplish
      a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh, '
    9: '⁹ then he shall offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an
      ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil; '
    10: '¹⁰ and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an
      offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. '
    11: '¹¹ Thus it shall be done for each bull, for each ram, for each of the male
      lambs, or of the young goats. '
    12: "¹² According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone\
      \ according to their number. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering
      an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. '
    14: '¹⁴ If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you
      throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant
      aroma to Yahweh, as you do, so he shall do. '
    15: '¹⁵ For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger
      who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations. As
      you are, so the foreigner shall be before Yahweh. '
    16: "¹⁶ One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives\

    17: '¹⁷ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the
      land where I bring you, '
    19: '¹⁹ then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall
      offer up a wave offering to Yahweh. '
    20: '²⁰ Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering.
      As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it. '
    21: "²¹ Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout\
      \ your generations. \n"
    22: '²² “‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which Yahweh

    24: '²⁴ then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of

      drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. '
    25: '²⁵ The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children

      their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before
      Yahweh, for their error. '
    26: "²⁶ All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well\
      \ as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all\
      \ the people, it was done unwittingly. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “‘If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year
      old for a sin offering. '
    28: '²⁸ The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs when he sins unwittingly
      before Yahweh. He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. '
    29: "²⁹ You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him\

    30: '³⁰ “‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born

    32: '³² While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man
      gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. '
    33: '³³ Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and
      to all the congregation. '
    34: "³⁴ They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should\
      \ be done to him. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation
      shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.” '
    36: "³⁶ All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to\
      \ death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    38: '³⁸ “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make

    40: '⁴⁰ so that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your
      God. '
    41: '⁴¹ I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be
      your God: I am Yahweh your God.”'
  16:
    1: '¹ Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan
      and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took
      some men. '
    2: '² They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred
      fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown. '
    3: "³ They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and\

    4: '⁴ When Moses heard it, he fell on his face. '
    5: '⁵ He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show
      who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him

    6: '⁶ Do this: have Korah and all his company take censers, '
    7: "⁷ put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall\

    8: '⁸ Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi! '
    9: '⁹ Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from

    10: '¹⁰ and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi

    11: "¹¹ Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh!\

    15: "¹⁵ Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, “Don’t respect their offering.\
      \ I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before Yahweh, you,

    17: "¹⁷ Each man take his censer and put incense on it, and each man bring before\
      \ Yahweh his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each with\
      \ his censer.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ They each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it,
      and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. '
    19: "¹⁹ Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the\
      \ Tent of Meeting.\nYahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation. "
    20: '²⁰ Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, '
    21: "²¹ “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume\
      \ them in a moment!” \n"
    22: "²² They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all\
      \ flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    24: "²⁴ “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of\
      \ Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel
      followed him. '
    26: "²⁶ He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents\

      \ all their sins!” \n"
    27: "²⁷ So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every\
      \ side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with\
      \ their wives, their sons, and their little ones. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these

    29: '²⁹ If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what
      all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me. '
    30: "³⁰ But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows\
      \ them up with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then\
      \ you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.” \n"
    31: '³¹ As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them
      split apart. '
    32: '³² The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households,
      all of Korah’s men, and all their goods. '
    33: '³³ So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol. The
      earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly. '
    34: '³⁴ All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest
      the earth swallow us up!” '
    35: "³⁵ Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who\
      \ offered the incense. \n"
    36: '³⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    37: '³⁷ “Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers
      out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy, '
    38: "³⁸ even the censers of those who sinned against their own lives. Let them\
      \ be beaten into plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before\
      \ Yahweh. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.”\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned
      had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, '
    40: "⁴⁰ to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger\
      \ who isn’t of the offspring of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before\
      \ Yahweh, that he not be as Korah and as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him\
      \ by Moses. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained\
      \ against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!”\
      \ \n"
    42: '⁴² When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they
      looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh’s
      glory appeared. '
    43: '⁴³ Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    45: "⁴⁵ “Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”\
      \ They fell on their faces. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it,\
      \ lay incense on it, carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement\
      \ for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun.” \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The
      plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement
      for the people. '
    48: '⁴⁸ He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred,
      in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah. '
    50: ⁵⁰ Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague
      was stopped.
  17:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods from them, one for each
      fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve

    3: '³ You shall write Aaron’s name on Levi’s rod. There shall be one rod for each
      head of their fathers’ houses. '
    4: '⁴ You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the covenant, where
      I meet with you. '
    5: "⁵ It shall happen that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. I\
      \ will make the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against\
      \ you, cease from me.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods,
      for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, a total of twelve rods.
      Aaron’s rod was among their rods. '
    7: "⁷ Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the Tent of the Testimony. \n"
    8: '⁸ On the next day, Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony; and behold,
      Aaron’s rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and
      bore ripe almonds. '
    9: "⁹ Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of\
      \ Israel. They looked, and each man took his rod. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh said to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the covenant,
      to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make
      an end of their complaining against me, that they not die.” '
    11: "¹¹ Moses did so. As Yahweh commanded him, so he did. \n"
    12: '¹² The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we perish! We
      are undone! We are all undone! '
    13: ¹³ Everyone who keeps approaching Yahweh’s tabernacle, dies! Will we all perish?”
  18:
    1: '¹ Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your fathers’ house with you

      bear the iniquity of your priesthood. '
    2: '² Bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, near

    3: '³ They shall keep your commands and the duty of the whole Tent; only they

    16: "¹⁶ You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old,\

    28: '²⁸ Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes,
      which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give Yahweh’s
      wave offering to Aaron the priest. '

    4: '⁴ Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle
      her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. '
    5: '⁵ One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her meat, and her

    6: '⁶ The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into
      the middle of the burning of the heifer. '
    7: '⁷ Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in

      offering. '
    10: "¹⁰ He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be\

    13: "¹³ Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn’t\

    14: '¹⁴ “This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the

  20:
    1: '¹ The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness
      of Zin in the first month. The people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died there, and
      was buried there. '
    2: '² There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together
      against Moses and against Aaron. '
    3: '³ The people quarreled with Moses, and spoke, saying, “We wish that we had
      died when our brothers died before Yahweh! '
    4: '⁴ Why have you brought Yahweh’s assembly into this wilderness, that we should
      die there, we and our animals? '
    5: "⁵ Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil\

    6: '⁶ Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the
      Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces. Yahweh’s glory appeared to them. '
    7: '⁷ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    8: "⁸ “Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother,\
      \ and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall\
      \ bring water to them out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and\
      \ their livestock drink.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he
      said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water out of this rock for
      you?” '
    11: "¹¹ Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and\
      \ water came out abundantly. The congregation and their livestock drank. \n"

      \ bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.” \n"
    13: "¹³ These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove\
      \ with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:\n“Your\
      \ brother Israel says: You know all the travail that has happened to us; "
    15: '¹⁵ how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time.
      The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers. '
    16: "¹⁶ When we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought\
      \ us out of Egypt. Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border.\

    17: "¹⁷ “Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field\

      \ nor to the left, until we have passed your border.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with\
      \ the sword against you.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and\

      \ let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with
      many people, and with a strong hand. '
    21: "²¹ Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel\
      \ turned away from him. \n"
    22: '²² They traveled from Kadesh, and the children of Israel, even the whole
      congregation, came to Mount Hor. '
    23: '²³ Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land
      of Edom, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the
      land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against
      my word at the waters of Meribah. '
    25: '²⁵ Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; '
    26: "²⁶ and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron\

    27: '²⁷ Moses did as Yahweh commanded. They went up onto Mount Hor in the sight
      of all the congregation. '
    28: '²⁸ Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son.
      Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down
      from the mountain. '
    29: ²⁹ When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron
      thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
  21:
    1: '¹ The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard that Israel
      came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some of them
      captive. '
    2: '² Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this
      people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.” '
    3: "³ Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites;\
      \ and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was\
      \ called Hormah. \n"
    4: '⁴ They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the
      land of Edom. The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey. '
    5: "⁵ The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us\
      \ up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, there is\
      \ no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many
      people of Israel died. '
    7: "⁷ The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken\
      \ against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents\
      \ from us.” Moses prayed for the people. \n"
    8: '⁸ Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall
      happen that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” '
    9: "⁹ Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had\
      \ bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth. '
    11: '¹¹ They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness
      which is before Moab, toward the sunrise. '
    12: '¹² From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. '
    13: '¹³ From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon,
      which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for
      the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore it is said in The Book of the Wars of Yahweh, “Vaheb in Suphah,

      \ on the border of Moab.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Yahweh said\
      \ to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then Israel sang this song:\n“Spring up, well! Sing to it,\n"
    18: "¹⁸     the well, which the princes dug,\n    which the nobles of the people\
      \ dug,\n    with the scepter, and with their poles.”\nFrom the wilderness they\

    19: '¹⁹ and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; '
    20: '²⁰ and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top
      of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert. '
    21: '²¹ Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, '
    22: "²² “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard.\

    23: '²³ Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered
      all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and
      came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel. '
    24: '²⁴ Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from
      the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the
      children of Ammon was fortified. '
    25: '²⁵ Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites,
      in Heshbon, and in all its villages. '
    26: '²⁶ For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought
      against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even
      to the Arnon. '
    27: "²⁷ Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,\n“Come to Heshbon.\n    Let\
      \ the city of Sihon be built and established;\n"
    28: "²⁸ for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,\n    a flame from the city of Sihon.\n\
      It has devoured Ar of Moab,\n    The lords of the high places of the Arnon.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Woe to you, Moab!\n    You are undone, people of Chemosh!\nHe has given\
      \ his sons as fugitives,\n    and his daughters into captivity,\n    to Sihon\
      \ king of the Amorites.\n"
    30: "³⁰ We have shot at them.\n    Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.\nWe have\
      \ laid waste even to Nophah,\n    Which reaches to Medeba.” \n"
    31: '³¹ Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. '
    32: '³² Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the
      Amorites who were there. '
    33: "³³ They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went\
      \ out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your\
      \ hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to\
      \ Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” \n"
    35: ³⁵ So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were
      no survivors; and they possessed his land.
  22:
    1: '¹ The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond
      the Jordan at Jericho. '
    2: '² Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. '
    3: '³ Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed
      because of the children of Israel. '
    4: "⁴ Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all\
      \ that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.”\nBalak the\
      \ son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. "
    5: '⁵ He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the
      River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold,
      there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the
      earth, and they are staying opposite me. '
    6: "⁶ Please come now therefore, and curse this people for me; for they are too\
      \ mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that\
      \ I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed,\
      \ and he whom you curse is cursed.” \n"
    7: "⁷ The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of\
      \ divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words\
      \ of Balak. \n"
    8: "⁸ He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again,\
      \ as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. \n"
    9: "⁹ God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to
      me, '
    11: "¹¹ ‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the\
      \ earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against\
      \ them, and shall drive them out.’” \n"
    12: "¹² God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the\
      \ people, for they are blessed.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to\
      \ your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam\
      \ refuses to come with us.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they. '
    16: '¹⁶ They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Balak the son of Zippor says, ‘Please
      let nothing hinder you from coming to me, '
    17: "¹⁷ for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me\
      \ I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house
      full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do
      less or more. '
    19: "¹⁹ Now therefore please stay here tonight as well, that I may know what else\
      \ Yahweh will speak to me.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to\
      \ call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that\
      \ you shall do.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the
      princes of Moab. '
    22: '²² God’s anger burned because he went; and Yahweh’s angel placed himself
      in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and
      his two servants were with him. '
    23: '²³ The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn
      in his hand; and the donkey turned out of the path, and went into the field.
      Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the path. '
    24: '²⁴ Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall
      being on this side, and a wall on that side. '
    25: "²⁵ The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and\
      \ crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there
      was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. '
    27: "²⁷ The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s\
      \ anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have\
      \ I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” \n"
    29: "²⁹ Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were\
      \ a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.” \n"
    30: "³⁰ The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden\
      \ all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?”\n\
      He said, “No.” \n"
    31: '³¹ Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing
      in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell
      on his face. '
    32: '³² Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three
      times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse
      before me. '
    33: "³³ The donkey saw me, and turned away before me these three times. Unless\
      \ she had turned away from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved\
      \ her alive.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that\
      \ you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will\
      \ go back again.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but you shall only speak\
      \ the word that I shall speak to you.”\nSo Balaam went with the princes of Balak. "
    36: '³⁶ When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the
      City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part
      of the border. '
    37: "³⁷ Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send for you to summon you?\
      \ Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?”\
      \ \n"
    38: "³⁸ Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power\
      \ at all to speak anything? I will speak the word that God puts in my mouth.”\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes
      who were with him. '
    41: ⁴¹ In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places
      of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.
  23:
    1: "¹ Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here\
      \ seven bulls and seven rams for me.” \n"
    2: '² Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar
      a bull and a ram. '
    3: "³ Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps\
      \ Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.”\nHe went\
      \ to a bare height. "
    4: "⁴ God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and\
      \ I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus\
      \ you shall speak.” \n"
    6: '⁶ He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he,
      and all the princes of Moab. '
    7: "⁷ He took up his parable, and said,\n“From Aram has Balak brought me,\n  \
      \  the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.\nCome, curse Jacob for me.\n\
      \    Come, defy Israel.\n"
    8: "⁸ How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?\n    How shall I defy whom Yahweh\
      \ has not defied?\n"
    9: "⁹ For from the top of the rocks I see him.\n    From the hills I see him.\n\
      Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,\n    and shall not be listed among\
      \ the nations.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who can count the dust of Jacob,\n    or count the fourth part of Israel?\n\
      Let me die the death of the righteous!\n    Let my last end be like his!” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my\
      \ enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.” \n"
    12: "¹² He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh\
      \ puts in my mouth?” \n"
    13: "¹³ Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may\
      \ see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse\
      \ them from there for me.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built
      seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. '
    15: "¹⁵ He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet God\
      \ over there.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak,\
      \ and say this.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and\
      \ the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ He took up his parable, and said,\n“Rise up, Balak, and hear!\n    Listen\
      \ to me, you son of Zippor.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ God is not a man, that he should lie,\n    nor a son of man, that he should\
      \ repent.\nHas he said, and he won’t do it?\n    Or has he spoken, and he won’t\
      \ make it good?\n"
    20: "²⁰ Behold, I have received a command to bless.\n    He has blessed, and I\
      \ can’t reverse it.\n"
    21: "²¹ He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.\n    Neither has he seen perverseness\
      \ in Israel.\nYahweh his God is with him.\n    The shout of a king is among\
      \ them.\n"
    22: "²² God brings them out of Egypt.\n    He has as it were the strength of the\
      \ wild ox.\n"
    23: "²³ Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;\n    Neither is there any divination\
      \ with Israel.\nNow it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,\n    ‘What has\
      \ God done!’\n"
    24: "²⁴ Behold, a people rises up as a lioness.\n    As a lion he lifts himself\
      \ up.\nHe shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,\n    and drinks the\
      \ blood of the slain.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh\
      \ speaks, that I must do?’” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps\
      \ it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. '
    29: "²⁹ Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven\
      \ bulls and seven rams for me here.” \n"
    30: ³⁰ Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every
      altar.
  24:
    1: '¹ When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as
      at the other times, to use divination, but he set his face toward the wilderness. '
    2: '² Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their
      tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. '
    3: "³ He took up his parable, and said,\n“Balaam the son of Beor says,\n    the\
      \ man whose eyes are open says;\n"
    4: "⁴ he says, who hears the words of God,\n    who sees the vision of the Almighty,\n\
      \    falling down, and having his eyes open:\n"
    5: "⁵ How goodly are your tents, Jacob,\n    and your dwellings, Israel!\n"
    6: "⁶ As valleys they are spread out,\n    as gardens by the riverside,\n    as\
      \ aloes which Yahweh has planted,\n    as cedar trees beside the waters.\n"
    7: "⁷ Water shall flow from his buckets.\n    His seed shall be in many waters.\n\
      His king shall be higher than Agag.\n    His kingdom shall be exalted.\n"
    8: "⁸ God brings him out of Egypt.\n    He has as it were the strength of the\
      \ wild ox.\nHe shall consume the nations his adversaries,\n    shall break their\
      \ bones in pieces,\n    and pierce them with his arrows.\n"
    9: "⁹ He couched, he lay down as a lion,\n    as a lioness;\n    who shall rouse\
      \ him up?\nEveryone who blesses you is blessed.\n    Everyone who curses you\
      \ is cursed.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together.
      Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have
      altogether blessed them these three times. '
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, flee to your place, now! I thought to promote you to great\
      \ honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.” \n"
    12: '¹² Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers whom you sent
      to me, saying, '
    13: '¹³ ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go
      beyond Yahweh’s word, to do either good or bad from my own mind. I will say
      what Yahweh says’? '
    14: "¹⁴ Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people\
      \ shall do to your people in the latter days.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He took up his parable, and said,\n“Balaam the son of Beor says,\n   \

    16: "¹⁶     he says, who hears the words of God,\n    knows the knowledge of the\
      \ Most High,\n    and who sees the vision of the Almighty,\n    falling down,\

    17: "¹⁷ I see him, but not now.\n    I see him, but not near.\nA star will come\
      \ out of Jacob.\n    A scepter will rise out of Israel,\nand shall strike through\
      \ the corners of Moab,\n    and crush all the sons of Sheth.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Edom shall be a possession.\n    Seir, his enemy, also shall be a possession,\n\
      \    while Israel does valiantly.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,\n    and shall destroy the remnant\
      \ from the city.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,\n“Amalek was the\
      \ first of the nations,\n    But his latter end shall come to destruction.”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,\n“Your dwelling\

    22: "²² Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,\n    until Asshur carries you away\
      \ captive.” \n"
    23: "²³ He took up his parable, and said,\n“Alas, who shall live when God does\
      \ this?\n"
    24: "²⁴     But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim.\nThey shall afflict\
      \ Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.\n    He also shall come to destruction.” \n"
    25: ²⁵ Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went
      his way.
  25:
    1: '¹ Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with
      the daughters of Moab; '
    2: '² for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate
      and bowed down to their gods. '
    3: '³ Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, and Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel. '
    4: "⁴ Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them\
      \ up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away\
      \ from Israel.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined\
      \ themselves to Baal Peor.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a
      Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation
      of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of
      Meeting. '
    7: '⁷ When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it,
      he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand. '
    8: '⁸ He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them
      through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was
      stopped among the children of Israel. '
    9: "⁹ Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    11: '¹¹ “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned
      my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy
      among them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy. '
    12: '¹² Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace. '
    13: "¹³ It shall be to him, and to his offspring after him, the covenant of an\
      \ everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement\
      \ for the children of Israel.’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the
      Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among
      the Simeonites. '
    15: "¹⁵ The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter\
      \ of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ “Harass the Midianites, and strike them; '
    18: ¹⁸ for they harassed you with their wiles, wherein they have deceived you
      in the matter of Peor, and in the incident regarding Cozbi, the daughter of
      the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in
      the matter of Peor.”
  26:
    1: '¹ After the plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron
      the priest, saying, '
    2: '² “Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty
      years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to
      war in Israel.” '
    3: '³ Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the
      Jordan at Jericho, saying, '
    4: "⁴ “Take a census, from twenty years old and upward, as Yahweh commanded Moses\

    10: '¹⁰ and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah

      number of names. '
    54: '⁵⁴ To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you

    62: '⁶² Those who were counted of them were twenty-three thousand, every male

      counted the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. '
    64: '⁶⁴ But among these there was not a man of them who were counted by Moses
      and Aaron the priest, who counted the children of Israel in the wilderness of
      Sinai. '
    65: ⁶⁵ For Yahweh had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.”
      There was not a man left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua
      the son of Nun.
  27:
    1: '¹ Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,

      who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but
      he died in his own sin. He had no sons. '
    4: "⁴ Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because\

      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Moses brought their cause before Yahweh. '
    6: '⁶ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    7: '⁷ “The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession
      of an inheritance among their father’s brothers. You shall cause the inheritance
      of their father to pass to them. '
    8: '⁸ You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies, and has
      no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. '

    10: '¹⁰ If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s

      \ Moses.’” \n"
    12: '¹² Yahweh said to Moses, “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and see the
      land which I have given to the children of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron
      your brother was gathered; '
    14: "¹⁴ because in the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against my word\
      \ in the wilderness of Zin, to honor me as holy at the waters before their eyes.”\
      \ (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.) \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the
      congregation, '
    17: "¹⁷ who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may\
      \ lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the congregation of Yahweh\
      \ may not be as sheep which have no shepherd.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Yahweh said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the
      Spirit, and lay your hand on him. '
    19: '¹⁹ Set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and
      commission him in their sight. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall give authority to him, that all the congregation of the children
      of Israel may obey. '
    21: "²¹ He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by\
      \ the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh. At his word they shall go out, and\
      \ at his word they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with\
      \ him, even all the congregation.” \n"
    22: '²² Moses did as Yahweh commanded him. He took Joshua, and set him before
      Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation. '
    23: ²³ He laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as Yahweh spoke by Moses.
  28:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘See that you present my
      offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, as a pleasant aroma to me,
      in their due season.’ '
    3: '³ You shall tell them, ‘This is the offering made by fire which you shall
      offer to Yahweh: male lambs a year old without defect, two day by day, for a

    4: '⁴ You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other
      lamb at evening, '

      shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place. '
    8: "⁸ The other lamb you shall offer at evening. As the meal offering of the morning,\

      Moses.
  30:
    1: '¹ Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying,
      “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded. '
    2: "² When a man vows a vow to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind his soul with\
      \ a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds\
      \ out of his mouth. \n"
    3: '³ “Also, when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh and binds herself by a pledge,
      being in her father’s house, in her youth, '
    4: '⁴ and her father hears her vow and her pledge with which she has bound her
      soul, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and
      every pledge with which she has bound her soul shall stand. '
    5: "⁵ But if her father forbids her in the day that he hears, none of her vows\
      \ or of her pledges with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. Yahweh will\
      \ forgive her, because her father has forbidden her. \n"
    6: '⁶ “If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance
      of her lips with which she has bound her soul, '
    7: '⁷ and her husband hears it, and says nothing to her in the day that he hears
      it; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges with which she has bound her
      soul shall stand. '
    8: "⁸ But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he makes\
      \ void her vow which is on her and the rash utterance of her lips, with which\
      \ she has bound her soul. Yahweh will forgive her. \n"
    9: "⁹ “But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which\

    10: '¹⁰ “If she vowed in her husband’s house or bound her soul by a bond with
      an oath, '
    11: '¹¹ and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her and didn’t disallow
      her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge with which she bound her
      soul shall stand. '
    12: '¹² But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them,
      then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the
      bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void. Yahweh will
      forgive her. '
    13: '¹³ Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may

    15: "¹⁵ But if he makes them null and void after he has heard them, then he shall\
      \ bear her iniquity.” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ These are the statutes which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and
      his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s
      house.
  31:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: "² “Avenge the children of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall be\

    3: '³ Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for war, that
      they may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh’s vengeance on Midian. '
    4: '⁴ You shall send one thousand out of every tribe, throughout all the tribes
      of Israel, to the war.” '
    5: '⁵ So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from
      every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. '
    6: '⁶ Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war with Phinehas the
      son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and
      the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. '
    7: '⁷ They fought against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses. They killed every
      male. '
    8: '⁸ They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem,
      Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son
      of Beor with the sword. '
    9: '⁹ The children of Israel took the women of Midian captive with their little
      ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took
      as plunder. '
    10: '¹⁰ All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments,
      they burned with fire. '
    11: '¹¹ They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal. '
    12: '¹² They brought the captives with the prey and the plunder, to Moses, and
      to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to
      the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho. '
    13: '¹³ Moses and Eleazar the priest, with all the princes of the congregation,
      went out to meet them outside of the camp. '
    14: '¹⁴ Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands
      and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moses said to them, “Have you saved all the women alive? '
    16: '¹⁶ Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam,
      to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was
      among the congregation of Yahweh. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman
      who has known man by lying with him. '
    18: "¹⁸ But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive\
      \ for yourselves. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Encamp outside of the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed any person,
      and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on
      the seventh day, you and your captives. '
    20: "²⁰ You shall purify every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all\
      \ work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, “This
      is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses. '
    22: '²² However the gold, and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the
      lead, '
    23: '²³ everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the
      fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water
      for impurity. All that doesn’t withstand the fire you shall make to go through
      the water. '
    24: "²⁴ You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean.\
      \ Afterward you shall come into the camp.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “Count the plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and
      Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation; '
    27: '²⁷ and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war,
      who went out to battle, and all the congregation. '
    28: '²⁸ Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle: one
      soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of
      the flocks. '
    29: '²⁹ Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh’s
      wave offering. '
    30: "³⁰ Of the children of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every\
      \ fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of\
      \ all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of Yahweh’s\
      \ tabernacle.” \n"
    31: "³¹ Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses. \n"
    32: '³² Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was
      six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, '
    33: '³³ seventy-two thousand head of cattle, '
    34: '³⁴ sixty-one thousand donkeys, '
    35: '³⁵ and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known
      man by lying with him. '
    36: '³⁶ The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number
      three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep; '
    37: '³⁷ and Yahweh’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five. '
    38: '³⁸ The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which Yahweh’s tribute was seventy-two. '
    39: '³⁹ The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which Yahweh’s tribute
      was sixty-one. '
    40: '⁴⁰ The persons were sixteen thousand, of whom Yahweh’s tribute was thirty-two
      persons. '
    41: '⁴¹ Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh’s wave offering, to Eleazar the
      priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses. '
    42: '⁴² Of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men
      who fought '
    43: '⁴³ (now the congregation’s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five
      hundred sheep, '
    44: '⁴⁴ thirty-six thousand head of cattle, '
    45: '⁴⁵ thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, '
    46: '⁴⁶ and sixteen thousand persons), '
    47: "⁴⁷ even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every\
      \ fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed\
      \ the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle, as Yahweh commanded Moses. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of
      thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses. '
    49: '⁴⁹ They said to Moses, “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war
      who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. '
    50: "⁵⁰ We have brought Yahweh’s offering, what every man found: gold ornaments,\
      \ armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement\
      \ for our souls before Yahweh.” \n"
    51: '⁵¹ Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. '
    52: '⁵² All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the
      captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand
      seven hundred fifty shekels. '
    53: '⁵³ The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself. '
    54: ⁵⁴ Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands
      and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting for a memorial for
      the children of Israel before Yahweh.
  32:
    1: '¹ Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude
      of livestock. They saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead. Behold, the
      place was a place for livestock. '
    2: '² Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses,
      and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, '
    3: '³ “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, '
    4: '⁴ the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land
      for livestock; and your servants have livestock.” '
    5: "⁵ They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given\
      \ to your servants for a possession. Don’t bring us over the Jordan.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, “Shall
      your brothers go to war while you sit here? '
    7: '⁷ Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over
      into the land which Yahweh has given them? '
    8: '⁸ Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. '
    9: '⁹ For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged
      the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which
      Yahweh had given them. '
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh’s anger burned in that day, and he swore, saying, '
    11: '¹¹ ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old
      and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;
      because they have not wholly followed me, '
    12: '¹² except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of
      Nun, because they have followed Yahweh completely.’ '
    13: "¹³ Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he made them wander back and\
      \ forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation who had done\
      \ evil in Yahweh’s sight was consumed. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful
      men, to increase the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the\
      \ wilderness; and you will destroy all these people.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our
      livestock, and cities for our little ones; '
    17: '¹⁷ but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel,
      until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the
      fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. '
    18: '¹⁸ We will not return to our houses until the children of Israel have all
      received their inheritance. '
    19: "¹⁹ For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and\
      \ beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan\
      \ eastward.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Moses said to them: “If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves
      to go before Yahweh to the war, '
    21: '²¹ and every one of your armed men will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh
      until he has driven out his enemies from before him, '
    22: "²² and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return,\
      \ and be clear of obligation to Yahweh and to Israel. Then this land shall be\
      \ your possession before Yahweh. \n"
    23: '²³ “But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and
      be sure your sin will find you out. '
    24: "²⁴ Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that\
      \ which has proceeded out of your mouth.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying,
      “Your servants will do as my lord commands. '
    26: '²⁶ Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall be
      there in the cities of Gilead; '
    27: "²⁷ but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before\
      \ Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua
      the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of
      the children of Israel. '
    29: '²⁹ Moses said to them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben
      will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle before
      Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land
      of Gilead for a possession; '
    30: "³⁰ but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions\
      \ among you in the land of Canaan.” \n"
    31: '³¹ The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As Yahweh
      has said to your servants, so will we do. '
    32: "³² We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the\
      \ possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.” \n"
    33: '³³ Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of
      Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of
      Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan; the land,
      according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land. '
    34: '³⁴ The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, '
    35: '³⁵ Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, '
    36: '³⁶ Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities and folds for sheep. '
    37: '³⁷ The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, '
    38: '³⁸ Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah. They gave
      other names to the cities which they built. '
    39: '³⁹ The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, took it, and
      dispossessed the Amorites who were therein. '
    40: '⁴⁰ Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he lived therein. '
    41: '⁴¹ Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its villages, and called them Havvoth
      Jair. '
    42: ⁴² Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after
      his own name.
  33:
    1: '¹ These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went out of
      the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. '
    2: '² Moses wrote the starting points of their journeys by the commandment of
      Yahweh. These are their journeys according to their starting points. '
    3: '³ They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the
      first month; on the next day after the Passover, the children of Israel went
      out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians, '
    4: '⁴ while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom Yahweh had struck
      among them. Yahweh also executed judgments on their gods. '
    5: '⁵ The children of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth. '
    6: '⁶ They traveled from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge
      of the wilderness. '
    7: '⁷ They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth, which is before
      Baal Zephon, and they encamped before Migdol. '
    8: '⁸ They traveled from before Hahiroth, and crossed through the middle of the
      sea into the wilderness. They went three days’ journey in the wilderness of
      Etham, and encamped in Marah. '
    9: '⁹ They traveled from Marah, and came to Elim. In Elim, there were twelve springs
      of water and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there. '
    10: '¹⁰ They traveled from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea. '
    11: '¹¹ They traveled from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin. '
    12: '¹² They traveled from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah. '
    13: '¹³ They traveled from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. '
    14: '¹⁴ They traveled from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where there was no
      water for the people to drink. '
    15: '¹⁵ They traveled from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai. '
    16: '¹⁶ They traveled from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth Hattaavah. '
    17: '¹⁷ They traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth. '
    18: '¹⁸ They traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah. '
    19: '¹⁹ They traveled from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon Perez. '
    20: '²⁰ They traveled from Rimmon Perez, and encamped in Libnah. '
    21: '²¹ They traveled from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah. '
    22: '²² They traveled from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah. '
    23: '²³ They traveled from Kehelathah, and encamped in Mount Shepher. '
    24: '²⁴ They traveled from Mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah. '
    25: '²⁵ They traveled from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth. '

    28: '²⁸ They traveled from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah. '
    29: '²⁹ They traveled from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah. '
    30: '³⁰ They traveled from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth. '
    31: '³¹ They traveled from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene Jaakan. '
    32: '³² They traveled from Bene Jaakan, and encamped in Hor Haggidgad. '
    33: '³³ They traveled from Hor Haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah. '
    34: '³⁴ They traveled from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah. '

    36: '³⁶ They traveled from Ezion Geber, and encamped at Kadesh in the wilderness
      of Zin. '
    37: '³⁷ They traveled from Kadesh, and encamped in Mount Hor, in the edge of the
      land of Edom. '
    38: '³⁸ Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh and
      died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of
      the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month. '
    39: '³⁹ Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor. '
    40: '⁴⁰ The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the South in the land of Canaan,
      heard of the coming of the children of Israel. '
    41: '⁴¹ They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah. '

    49: '⁴⁹ They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim
      in the plains of Moab. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho,
      saying, '
    51: '⁵¹ Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, “When you pass over the
      Jordan into the land of Canaan, '
    52: '⁵² then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you,
      destroy all their stone idols, destroy all their molten images, and demolish
      all their high places. '
    53: '⁵³ You shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for I have given
      the land to you to possess it. '
    54: "⁵⁴ You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger\
      \ groups you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give\
      \ a smaller inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his.\
      \ You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers. \n"
    55: '⁵⁵ “But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you,
      then those you let remain of them will be like pricks in your eyes and thorns
      in your sides. They will harass you in the land in which you dwell. '
    56: ⁵⁶ It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you.”
  34:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    2: '² “Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the
      land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance,

    3: '³ then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the
      side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward. '
    4: '⁴ Your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass
      along to Zin; and it shall pass southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go
      from there to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon. '
    5: "⁵ The border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and it shall\
      \ end at the sea. \n"
    6: "⁶ “‘For the western border, you shall have the great sea and its border. This\
      \ shall be your west border. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘This shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall mark out

    12: "¹² The border shall go down to the Jordan, and end at the Salt Sea. This\

      and to the half-tribe; '
    14: '¹⁴ for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses,

    18: '¹⁸ You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance. '
    19: '¹⁹ These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of
      Jephunneh. '
    20: '²⁰ Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. '
    21: '²¹ Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. '

  35:
    1: '¹ Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, '
    2: '² “Command the children of Israel to give to the Levites cities to dwell in
      out of their inheritance. You shall give pasture lands for the cities around
      them to the Levites. '
    3: "³ They shall have the cities to dwell in. Their pasture lands shall be for\

    6: '⁶ “The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities
      of refuge, which you shall give for the man slayer to flee to. Besides them
      you shall give forty-two cities. '

      few. Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give some
      of his cities to the Levites.” '
    9: '⁹ Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you pass over the
      Jordan into the land of Canaan, '
    11: '¹¹ then you shall appoint for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for
      you, that the man slayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there. '
    12: '¹² The cities shall be for your refuge from the avenger, that the man slayer
      not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment. '
    13: '¹³ The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three
      cities in the land of Canaan. They shall be cities of refuge. '
    15: "¹⁵ These six cities shall be refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger,\
      \ and for the foreigner living among them, that everyone who kills any person\
      \ unwittingly may flee there. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “‘But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he
      is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. '
    17: '¹⁷ If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and
      he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. '
    18: '¹⁸ Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man
      may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to
      death. '
    19: '¹⁹ The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death. When he
      meets him, he shall put him to death. '
    20: '²⁰ If he shoved him out of hatred, or hurled something at him while lying
      in wait, so that he died, '
    21: "²¹ or in hostility struck him with his hand, so that he died, he who struck\
      \ him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall\
      \ put the murderer to death when he meets him. \n"
    22: '²² “‘But if he shoved him suddenly without hostility, or hurled on him anything
      without lying in wait, '
    23: '²³ or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it
      on him so that he died, and he was not his enemy and not seeking his harm, '
    24: '²⁴ then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger
      of blood according to these ordinances. '
    25: "²⁵ The congregation shall deliver the man slayer out of the hand of the avenger\
      \ of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where\
      \ he had fled. He shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who\
      \ was anointed with the holy oil. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “‘But if the man slayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his
      city of refuge where he flees, '
    27: '²⁷ and the avenger of blood finds him outside of the border of his city of
      refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the man slayer, he shall not be guilty
      of blood, '
    28: "²⁸ because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death\
      \ of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the man slayer\
      \ shall return into the land of his possession. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “‘These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout\
      \ your generations in all your dwellings. \n"
    30: "³⁰ “‘Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain based on the testimony\
      \ of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify alone against any person so\
      \ that he dies. \n"
    31: "³¹ “‘Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is\
      \ guilty of death. He shall surely be put to death. \n"
    32: "³² “‘You shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge,\
      \ that he may come again to dwell in the land before the death of the priest.\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ “‘So you shall not pollute the land where you live; for blood pollutes
      the land. No atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed
      in it, but by the blood of him who shed it. '
    34: ³⁴ You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, where I dwell; for I,
      Yahweh, dwell among the children of Israel.’”
  36:
    1: '¹ The heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the children of Gilead,
      the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph,
      came near, and spoke before Moses and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’
      households of the children of Israel. '
    2: '² They said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by
      lot to the children of Israel. My lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance
      of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. '
    3: '³ If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children
      of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of
      our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they
      shall belong. So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. '
    4: "⁴ When the jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance\
      \ will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong.\
      \ So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe\
      \ of our fathers.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Moses commanded the children of Israel according to Yahweh’s word, saying,
      “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speak what is right. '
    6: '⁶ This is the thing which Yahweh commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,
      saying, ‘Let them be married to whom they think best, only they shall marry
      into the family of the tribe of their father. '
    7: '⁷ So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel move from tribe to tribe;
      for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his
      fathers. '
    8: '⁸ Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children
      of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that
      the children of Israel may each possess the inheritance of his fathers. '
    9: "⁹ So shall no inheritance move from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes\
      \ of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh commanded Moses: '
    11: '¹¹ for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad,
      were married to their father’s brothers’ sons. '
    12: "¹² They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of\
      \ Joseph. Their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.\
      \ \n"
    13: ¹³ These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by
      Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
