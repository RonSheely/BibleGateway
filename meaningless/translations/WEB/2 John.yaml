2 John:
  1:
    1: '¹ The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and
      not I only, but also all those who know the truth, '
    2: '² for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: '
    3: "³ Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the\
      \ Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. \n"
    4: '⁴ I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth,
      even as we have been commanded by the Father. '
    5: '⁵ Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment,
      but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. '
    6: '⁶ This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is
      the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk
      in it. '
    7: '⁷ For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess
      that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. '
    8: '⁸ Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished,
      but that we receive a full reward. '
    9: '⁹ Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t
      have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive
      him into your house, and don’t welcome him, '
    11: "¹¹ for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. \n"
    12: '¹² Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and
      ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may
      be made full. '
    13: ¹³ The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
