Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and\
      \ Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, heavens,\n    and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:\n“I have nourished\
      \ and brought up children\n    and they have rebelled against me.\n"
    3: "³ The ox knows his owner,\n    and the donkey his master’s crib;\n    but\
      \ Israel doesn’t know.\n    My people don’t consider.”\n"
    4: "⁴ Ah sinful nation,\n    a people loaded with iniquity,\n    offspring of\
      \ evildoers,\n    children who deal corruptly!\nThey have forsaken Yahweh.\n\
      \    They have despised the Holy One of Israel.\n    They are estranged and\
      \ backward.\n"
    5: "⁵ Why should you be beaten more,\n    that you revolt more and more?\nThe\
      \ whole head is sick,\n    and the whole heart faint.\n"
    6: "⁶ From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:\n\
      \    wounds, welts, and open sores.\n    They haven’t been closed, bandaged,\
      \ or soothed with oil.\n"
    7: "⁷ Your country is desolate.\n    Your cities are burned with fire.\n    Strangers\
      \ devour your land in your presence\n    and it is desolate,\n    as overthrown\
      \ by strangers.\n"
    8: "⁸ The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,\n    like a hut\
      \ in a field of melons,\n    like a besieged city.\n"
    9: "⁹ Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,\n    we would\
      \ have been as Sodom.\n    We would have been like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear Yahweh’s word, you rulers of Sodom!\n    Listen to the law of our\
      \ God, you people of Gomorrah!\n"
    11: "¹¹ “What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh.\n   \
      \ “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams\n    and the fat of fed\
      \ animals.\n    I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,\n    or of lambs,\n \
      \   or of male goats.\n"
    12: "¹² When you come to appear before me,\n    who has required this at your\
      \ hand, to trample my courts?\n"
    13: "¹³ Bring no more vain offerings.\n    Incense is an abomination to me.\n\
      \    New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:\n    I can’t stand evil assemblies.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.\n    They are\
      \ a burden to me.\n    I am weary of bearing them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.\n    Yes,\
      \ when you make many prayers, I will not hear.\n    Your hands are full of blood.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wash yourselves. Make yourself clean.\n    Put away the evil of your doings\
      \ from before my eyes.\n    Cease to do evil.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Learn to do well.\n    Seek justice.\n    Relieve the oppressed.\nDefend\
      \ the fatherless.\n    Plead for the widow.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Come now, and let’s reason together,” says Yahweh:\n    “Though your\
      \ sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.\n    Though they are\
      \ red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you are willing and obedient,\n    you will eat the good of the land;\n"
    20: "²⁰     but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword;\n\
      \    for the Yahweh’s mouth has spoken it.” \n"
    21: "²¹ How the faithful city has become a prostitute!\n    She was full of justice.\n\
      Righteousness lodged in her,\n    but now there are murderers.\n"
    22: "²² Your silver has become dross,\n    your wine mixed with water.\n"
    23: "²³ Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves.\n    Everyone loves\
      \ bribes and follows after rewards.\n    They don’t defend the fatherless,\n\
      \    neither does the cause of the widow come to them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,\n    the Mighty One of Israel, says:\n\
      “Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,\n    and avenge myself on my enemies.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will turn my hand on you,\n    thoroughly purge away your dross,\n \
      \   and will take away all your tin.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I will restore your judges as at the first,\n    and your counselors as\
      \ at the beginning.\nAfterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,\n\
      \    a faithful town.’\n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion shall be redeemed with justice,\n    and her converts with righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,\n\
      \    and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.\n"
    29: "²⁹ For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,\n    and\
      \ you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,\n    and as a garden that\
      \ has no water.\n"
    31: "³¹ The strong will be like tinder,\n    and his work like a spark.\nThey\
      \ will both burn together,\n    and no one will quench them.”"
  2:
    1: "¹ This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house\
      \ shall be established on the top of the mountains,\n    and shall be raised\
      \ above the hills;\n    and all nations shall flow to it.\n"
    3: "³ Many peoples shall go and say,\n    “Come, let’s go up to the mountain of\
      \ Yahweh,\n    to the house of the God of Jacob;\n    and he will teach us of\
      \ his ways,\n    and we will walk in his paths.”\nFor the law shall go out of\
      \ Zion,\n    and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ He will judge between the nations,\n    and will decide concerning many\
      \ peoples.\n    They shall beat their swords into plowshares,\n    and their\
      \ spears into pruning hooks.\nNation shall not lift up sword against nation,\n\
      \    neither shall they learn war any more. \n"
    5: "⁵ House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of Yahweh.\n"
    6: "⁶ For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,\n    because they\
      \ are filled from the east,\n    with those who practice divination like the\
      \ Philistines,\n    and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.\n"
    7: "⁷ Their land is full of silver and gold,\n    neither is there any end of\
      \ their treasures.\nTheir land also is full of horses,\n    neither is there\
      \ any end of their chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land also is full of idols.\n    They worship the work of their own\
      \ hands,\n    that which their own fingers have made.\n"
    9: "⁹ Man is brought low,\n    and mankind is humbled;\n    therefore don’t forgive\
      \ them.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Enter into the rock,\n    and hide in the dust,\nfrom before the terror\
      \ of Yahweh,\n    and from the glory of his majesty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The lofty looks of man will be brought low,\n    the arrogance of men\
      \ will be bowed down,\n    and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day. \n"
    12: "¹² For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and\
      \ arrogant,\n    and for all that is lifted up;\n    and it shall be brought\
      \ low:\n"
    13: "¹³     for all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,\n    for\
      \ all the oaks of Bashan,\n"
    14: "¹⁴     for all the high mountains,\n    for all the hills that are lifted\
      \ up,\n"
    15: "¹⁵     for every lofty tower,\n    for every fortified wall,\n"
    16: "¹⁶     for all the ships of Tarshish,\n    and for all pleasant imagery.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,\n    and the arrogance of men\
      \ shall be brought low;\n    and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The idols shall utterly pass away.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,\n    and into the holes of the\
      \ earth,\n    from before the terror of Yahweh,\n    and from the glory of his\
      \ majesty,\n    when he arises to shake the earth mightily.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver\n    and their\
      \ idols of gold,\n    which have been made for themselves to worship,\n    to\
      \ the moles and to the bats,\n"
    21: "²¹     to go into the caverns of the rocks,\n    and into the clefts of the\
      \ ragged rocks,\n    from before the terror of Yahweh,\n    and from the glory\
      \ of his majesty,\n    when he arises to shake the earth mightily.\n"
    22: "²² Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;\n    for of what\
      \ account is he?"
  3:
    1: "¹ For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from\
      \ Judah supply and support,\n    the whole supply of bread,\n    and the whole\
      \ supply of water;\n"
    2: "²     the mighty man,\n    the man of war,\n    the judge,\n    the prophet,\n\
      \    the diviner,\n    the elder,\n"
    3: "³     the captain of fifty,\n    the honorable man,\n    the counselor,\n\
      \    the skilled craftsman,\n    and the clever enchanter.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will give boys to be their princes,\n    and children shall rule over\
      \ them.\n"
    5: "⁵ The people will be oppressed,\n    everyone by another,\n    and everyone\
      \ by his neighbor.\nThe child will behave himself proudly against the old man,\n\
      \    and the wicked against the honorable.\n"
    6: "⁶ Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father,\
      \ saying,\n    “You have clothing, you be our ruler,\n    and let this ruin\
      \ be under your hand.”\n"
    7: "⁷ In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;\n    for in\
      \ my house is neither bread nor clothing.\n    You shall not make me ruler of\
      \ the people.”\n"
    8: "⁸ For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;\n    because their tongue\
      \ and their doings are against Yahweh,\nto provoke the eyes of his glory.\n"
    9: "⁹ The look of their faces testify against them.\n    They parade their sin\
      \ like Sodom.\n    They don’t hide it.\n    Woe to their soul!\n    For they\
      \ have brought disaster upon themselves.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell the righteous “Good!”\n    For they shall eat the fruit of their\
      \ deeds.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to the wicked!\n    Disaster is upon them;\n    for the deeds of his\
      \ hands will be paid back to him.\n"
    12: "¹² As for my people, children are their oppressors,\n    and women rule over\
      \ them.\n    My people, those who lead you cause you to err,\n    and destroy\
      \ the way of your paths. \n"
    13: "¹³ Yahweh stands up to contend,\n    and stands to judge the peoples.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people\n    and\
      \ their leaders:\n    “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.\n    The plunder\
      \ of the poor is in your houses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵     What do you mean that you crush my people,\n    and grind the face\
      \ of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are arrogant,\n \
      \   and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,\n    walking to trip\
      \ as they go,\n    jingling ornaments on their feet;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women\
      \ of Zion,\n    and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands,
      the crescent necklaces, '
    19: '¹⁹ the earrings, the bracelets, the veils, '
    20: '²⁰ the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers,
      the charms, '
    21: '²¹ the signet rings, the nose rings, '
    22: '²² the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses, '
    23: "²³ the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;\n\
      \    instead of a belt, a rope;\n    instead of well set hair, baldness;\n \
      \   instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;\n    and branding instead of\
      \ beauty.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your men shall fall by the sword,\n    and your mighty in the war.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Her gates shall lament and mourn.\n    She shall be desolate and sit on\
      \ the ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat\
      \ our own bread, and wear our own clothing. Just let us be called by your name.\
      \ Take away our reproach.” \n"
    2: '² In that day, Yahweh’s branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit
      of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel. '
    3: '³ It will happen that he who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem
      shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem, '
    4: '⁴ when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
      and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from within it, by the spirit of
      justice and by the spirit of burning. '
    5: '⁵ Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion and over her
      assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night,
      for over all the glory will be a canopy. '
    6: ⁶ There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for
      a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
  5:
    1: "¹ Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.\n\
      \    My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.\n"
    2: "² He dug it up,\n    gathered out its stones,\n    planted it with the choicest\
      \ vine,\n    built a tower in the middle of it,\n    and also cut out a wine\
      \ press in it.\nHe looked for it to yield grapes,\n    but it yielded wild grapes.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,\n    please judge between\
      \ me and my vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?\n\
      \    Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?\n"
    5: "⁵ Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.\n    I will take away\
      \ its hedge, and it will be eaten up.\n    I will break down its wall, and it\
      \ will be trampled down.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will lay it a wasteland.\n    It won’t be pruned or hoed,\n    but it\
      \ will grow briers and thorns.\n    I will also command the clouds that they\
      \ rain no rain on it.”\n"
    7: "⁷ For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,\n    and the\
      \ men of Judah his pleasant plant:\n    and he looked for justice, but, behold,\
      \ oppression;\n    for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress. \n"
    8: "⁸ Woe to those who join house to house,\n    who lay field to field, until\
      \ there is no room,\n    and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the\
      \ land!\n"
    9: "⁹ In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate,\n\
      \    even great and beautiful, unoccupied.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,\n    and a homer of seed\
      \ shall yield an ephah.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong\
      \ drink,\n    who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!\n"
    12: "¹² The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;\n\
      \    but they don’t respect the work of Yahweh,\n    neither have they considered\
      \ the operation of his hands. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.\n    Their\
      \ honorable men are famished,\n    and their multitudes are parched with thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire,\n    and opened its mouth without\
      \ measure;\n    and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices\
      \ among them, descend into it.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So man is brought low,\n    mankind is humbled,\n    and the eyes of the\
      \ arrogant ones are humbled;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice,\n    and God the Holy One\
      \ is sanctified in righteousness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,\n    and strangers will\
      \ eat the ruins of the rich. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,\n    and wickedness\
      \ as with cart rope,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ who say, “Let him make haste, let him hasten his work, that we may see\
      \ it;\n    let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,\n \
      \   that we may know it!”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;\n    who put darkness\
      \ for light,\n    and light for darkness;\nwho put bitter for sweet,\n    and\
      \ sweet for bitter!\n"
    21: "²¹ Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,\n    and prudent in their\
      \ own sight!\n"
    22: "²² Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,\n    and champions at mixing\
      \ strong drink;\n"
    23: "²³ who acquit the guilty for a bribe,\n    but deny justice for the innocent!\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,\n    and as the dry\
      \ grass sinks down in the flame,\n    so their root shall be as rottenness,\n\
      \    and their blossom shall go up as dust,\nbecause they have rejected the\
      \ law of Yahweh of Armies,\n    and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Therefore Yahweh’s anger burns against his people,\n    and he has stretched\
      \ out his hand against them and has struck them.\nThe mountains tremble,\n \
      \   and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets.\nFor all\
      \ this, his anger is not turned away,\n    but his hand is still stretched out.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ He will lift up a banner to the nations from far away,\n    and he will\
      \ whistle for them from the end of the earth.\n    Behold, they will come speedily\
      \ and swiftly.\n"
    27: "²⁷ No one shall be weary nor stumble among them;\n    no one shall slumber\
      \ nor sleep,\n    neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,\n    nor\
      \ the strap of their sandals be broken,\n"
    28: "²⁸ whose arrows are sharp,\n    and all their bows bent.\nTheir horses’ hoofs\
      \ will be like flint,\n    and their wheels like a whirlwind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Their roaring will be like a lioness.\n    They will roar like young lions.\n\
      Yes, they shall roar,\n    and seize their prey and carry it off,\n    and there\
      \ will be no one to deliver.\n"
    30: "³⁰ They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.\n\
      \    If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress.\n    The light\
      \ is darkened in its clouds."

    1: '¹ In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high
      and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. '
    2: '² Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered
      his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew. '
    3: "³ One called to another, and said,\n“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!\n\
      \    The whole earth is full of his glory!” \n"
    4: '⁴ The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called,
      and the house was filled with smoke. '
    5: "⁵ Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean\
      \ lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the\
      \ King, Yahweh of Armies!” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which
      he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. '
    7: "⁷ He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips;\
      \ and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.” \n"
    8: "⁸ I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for\
      \ us?”\nThen I said, “Here I am. Send me!” \n"
    9: "⁹ He said, “Go, and tell this people,\n‘You hear indeed,\n    but don’t understand.\n\
      You see indeed,\n    but don’t perceive.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Make the heart of this people fat.\n    Make their ears heavy, and shut\
      \ their eyes;\nlest they see with their eyes,\n    hear with their ears,\n \
      \   understand with their heart,\n    and turn again, and be healed.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “Lord, how long?”\nHe answered,\n“Until cities are waste\
      \ without inhabitant,\n    houses without man,\n    the land becomes utterly\
      \ waste,\n"
    12: "¹²     and Yahweh has removed men far away,\n    and the forsaken places\
      \ are many within the land.\n"
    13: "¹³ If there is a tenth left in it,\n    that also will in turn be consumed,\n\
      as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stump remains when they are cut down;\n\
      \    so the holy seed is its stock.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah,
      Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went
      up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. '
    2: "² David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled,\
      \ and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub
      your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the
      fuller’s field. '
    4: '⁴ Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your
      heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce
      anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against
      you, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among
      ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.” '
    7: '⁷ This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it
      happen.” '
    8: '⁸ For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within
      sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be
      a people. '
    9: "⁹ The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son.\
      \ If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying, '
    11: "¹¹ “Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the\
      \ height above.” \n"
    12: "¹² But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt Yahweh.” \n"
    13: '¹³ He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try
      the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also? '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will
      conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. '
    15: '¹⁵ He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose
      the good. '
    16: '¹⁶ For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the
      land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken. '
    17: "¹⁷ Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house,\
      \ days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah, even\
      \ the king of Assyria. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is
      in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the
      land of Assyria. '
    19: "¹⁹ They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts\
      \ of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures. \n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts\
      \ beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of\
      \ the feet; and it shall also consume the beard. \n"
    21: '²¹ It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and
      two sheep. '
    22: "²² It shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall\
      \ give he shall eat butter; for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left\
      \ within the land. \n"
    23: '²³ It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand
      vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be for briers and thorns. '
    24: '²⁴ People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will
      be briers and thorns. '
    25: ²⁵ All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there
      for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen,
      and for sheep to tread on.”
  8:
    1: '¹ Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen,
      ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’; '
    2: "² and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest,\
      \ and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” \n"
    3: '³ I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh
      said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’ '
    4: "⁴ For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the\
      \ riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the\
      \ king of Assyria.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and
      rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; '
    7: '⁷ now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters
      of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all
      its channels, and go over all its banks. '
    8: '⁸ It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through. It will
      reach even to the neck. The stretching out of its wings will fill the width
      of your land, Immanuel. '
    9: '⁹ Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from
      far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be
      shattered! '
    10: '¹⁰ Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word,
      and it will not stand, for God is with us.” '
    11: '¹¹ For Yahweh spoke this to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not
      to walk in the way of this people, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say,
      ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized. '
    13: '¹³ Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must
      fear. He is the one you must dread. '
    14: '¹⁴ He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling
      stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will
      be a trap and a snare. '
    15: "¹⁵ Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.”\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Wrap up the covenant. Seal the law among my disciples. '
    17: '¹⁷ I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and
      I will look for him. '
    18: "¹⁸ Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and\
      \ for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and
      with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter,” shouldn’t a people consult with
      their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? '
    20: '²⁰ Turn to the law and to the covenant! If they don’t speak according to
      this word, surely there is no morning for them. '
    21: '²¹ They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry. It will happen
      that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their
      God. They will turn their faces upward, '
    22: ²² and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish.
      They will be driven into thick darkness.
  9:
    1: "¹ But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former\
      \ time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;\
      \ but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond\
      \ the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. \n"
    2: "² The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.\n    The light\
      \ has shined on those who lived in the land of the shadow of death.\n"
    3: "³ You have multiplied the nation.\n    You have increased their joy.\nThey\
      \ rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they\
      \ divide the plunder. "
    4: '⁴ For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his
      oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian. '
    5: '⁵ For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments
      rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. '
    6: '⁶ For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will
      be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
      Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. '
    7: "⁷ Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on\
      \ David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with\
      \ justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of\
      \ Yahweh of Armies will perform this. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord sent a word into Jacob,\n    and it falls on Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ All the people will know,\n    including Ephraim and the inhabitants of\
      \ Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “The bricks have fallen,\n    but we will build with cut stone.\nThe sycamore\
      \ fig trees have been cut down,\n    but we will put cedars in their place.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin,\n\
      \    and will stir up his enemies,\n"
    12: "¹²     The Syrians in front,\n    and the Philistines behind;\n    and they\
      \ will devour Israel with open mouth.\nFor all this, his anger is not turned\
      \ away,\n    but his hand is stretched out still. \n"
    13: "¹³ Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,\n    neither have\
      \ they sought Yahweh of Armies.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,\n    palm branch\
      \ and reed, in one day.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The elder and the honorable man is the head,\n    and the prophet who\
      \ teaches lies is the tail.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For those who lead this people lead them astray;\n    and those who are\
      \ led by them are destroyed.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,\n    neither\
      \ will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;\nfor everyone is profane\
      \ and an evildoer,\n    and every mouth speaks folly.\nFor all this his anger\
      \ is not turned away,\n    but his hand is stretched out still. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For wickedness burns like a fire.\n    It devours the briers and thorns;\n\
      \    yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,\n    and they roll upward\
      \ in a column of smoke.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Through Yahweh of Armies’ wrath, the land is burned up;\n    and the people\
      \ are the fuel for the fire.\n    No one spares his brother.\n"
    20: "²⁰ One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry;\n    and he will eat\
      \ on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.\nEveryone will eat the flesh\
      \ of his own arm:\n"
    21: "²¹     Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall\
      \ be against Judah.\nFor all this his anger is not turned away,\n    but his\
      \ hand is stretched out still."
  10:
    1: '¹ Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write
      oppressive decrees; '
    2: '² to deprive the needy of justice, and to rob the poor among my people of
      their rights, that widows may be their plunder, and that they may make the fatherless
      their prey! '
    3: "³ What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will\
      \ come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your\
      \ wealth? \n"
    4: "⁴ They will only bow down under the prisoners,\n    and will fall under the\
      \ slain.\nFor all this his anger is not turned away,\n    but his hand is stretched\
      \ out still. \n"
    5: '⁵ Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation! '
    6: '⁶ I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger
      me I will give him a command to take the plunder and to take the prey, and to
      tread them down like the mire of the streets. '
    7: '⁷ However he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in
      his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations. '
    8: '⁸ For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings? '
    9: '⁹ Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like
      Damascus?” '
    10: '¹⁰ As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images
      exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria; '
    11: "¹¹ shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem\
      \ and her idols? \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore it will happen that when the Lord has performed his whole work
      on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud
      heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his arrogant looks. '
    13: '¹³ For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my
      wisdom; for I have understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples,
      and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their
      rulers. '
    14: "¹⁴ My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one\
      \ gathers eggs that are abandoned, I have gathered all the earth. There was\
      \ no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself
      above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or
      as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness;
      and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire. '
    17: '¹⁷ The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame;
      and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. '
    18: '¹⁸ He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both
      soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints. '
    19: "¹⁹ The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could\
      \ write their number. \n"
    20: '²⁰ It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those
      who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who
      struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. '
    21: '²¹ A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. '
    22: '²² For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant
      of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness. '
    23: "²³ For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined,\
      \ throughout all the earth. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion,
      don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift
      up his staff against you, as Egypt did. '
    25: '²⁵ For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished,
      and my anger will be directed to his destruction.” '
    26: '²⁶ Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter
      of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift
      it up like he did against Egypt. '
    27: "²⁷ It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder,\
      \ and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of\
      \ the anointing oil. \n"
    28: '²⁸ He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores
      his baggage. '
    29: '²⁹ They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba.
      Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled. '
    30: '³⁰ Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor
      Anathoth! '
    31: '³¹ Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety. '
    32: "³² This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain\
      \ of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. \n"
    33: '³³ Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The
      tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low. '
    34: ³⁴ He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will
      fall by the Mighty One.
  11:
    1: "¹ A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse,\n    and a branch out of his\
      \ roots will bear fruit.\n"
    2: "² Yahweh’s Spirit will rest on him:\n    the spirit of wisdom and understanding,\n\
      \    the spirit of counsel and might,\n    the spirit of knowledge and of the\
      \ fear of Yahweh.\n"
    3: "³ His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh.\nHe will not judge by the sight\
      \ of his eyes,\n    neither decide by the hearing of his ears;\n"
    4: "⁴ but he will judge the poor with righteousness,\n    and decide with equity\
      \ for the humble of the earth.\nHe will strike the earth with the rod of his\
      \ mouth;\n    and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.\n"
    5: "⁵ Righteousness will be the belt of his waist,\n    and faithfulness the belt\
      \ of his waist. \n"
    6: "⁶ The wolf will live with the lamb,\n    and the leopard will lie down with\
      \ the young goat,\n    the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together;\n\
      \    and a little child will lead them.\n"
    7: "⁷ The cow and the bear will graze.\n    Their young ones will lie down together.\n\
      \    The lion will eat straw like the ox.\n"
    8: "⁸ The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole,\n    and the weaned child\
      \ will put his hand on the viper’s den.\n"
    9: "⁹ They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;\n    for the earth\
      \ will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh,\n    as the waters cover the sea.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse,\
      \ who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second
      time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt,
      from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands
      of the sea. '
    12: '¹² He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts
      of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners
      of the earth. '
    13: '¹³ The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will
      be cut off. Ephraim won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim. '
    14: '¹⁴ They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together
      they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over
      Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his
      scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into
      seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals. '
    16: ¹⁶ There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from
      Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land
      of Egypt.
  12:
    1: '¹ In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though
      you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me. '
    2: '² Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah,
      Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.” '
    3: '³ Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation. '
    4: '⁴ In that day you will say, “Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! Declare
      his doings among the peoples! Proclaim that his name is exalted! '
    5: '⁵ Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all
      the earth! '
    6: ⁶ Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is
      great among you!”
  13:
    1: "¹ The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw. \n"
    2: '² Set up a banner on the bare mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your
      hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. '
    3: '³ I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for
      my anger, even my proudly exulting ones. '
    4: '⁴ The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the
      noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Yahweh
      of Armies is mustering the army for the battle. '
    5: "⁵ They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Yahweh,\
      \ and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. \n"
    6: '⁶ Wail, for Yahweh’s day is at hand! It will come as destruction from the
      Almighty. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt. '
    8: '⁸ They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in
      pain like a woman in labor. They will look in amazement one at another. Their
      faces will be faces of flame. '
    9: '⁹ Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to
      make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners out of it. '
    10: '¹⁰ For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light.
      The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not cause its light
      to shine. '
    11: '¹¹ I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity.
      I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will humble the arrogance
      of the terrible. '
    12: '¹² I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure
      gold of Ophir. '
    13: '¹³ Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken
      out of its place in Yahweh of Armies’ wrath, and in the day of his fierce anger. '
    14: '¹⁴ It will happen that like a hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one
      gathers, they will each turn to their own people, and will each flee to their
      own land. '
    15: '¹⁵ Everyone who is found will be thrust through. Everyone who is captured
      will fall by the sword. '
    16: "¹⁶ Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses\
      \ will be ransacked, and their wives raped. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not value silver,
      and as for gold, they will not delight in it. '
    18: '¹⁸ Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity
      on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children. '
    19: '¹⁹ Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will
      be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. '
    20: '²⁰ It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation
      to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds
      make their flocks lie down there. '
    21: '²¹ But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be
      full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there. '
    22: ²² Wolves will cry in their fortresses, and jackals in the pleasant palaces.
      Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.
  14:
    1: '¹ For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and
      set them in their own land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they
      will unite with the house of Jacob. '
    2: "² The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of\
      \ Israel will possess them in Yahweh’s land for servants and for handmaids.\
      \ They will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall\
      \ rule over their oppressors. \n"
    3: '³ It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow,
      from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to serve, '
    4: '⁴ that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say,
      “How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!” '
    5: '⁵ Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers, '
    6: '⁶ who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations
      in anger, with a persecution that no one restrained. '
    7: '⁷ The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet. They break out in song. '
    8: '⁸ Yes, the cypress trees rejoice with you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying,
      “Since you are humbled, no lumberjack has come up against us.” '
    9: '⁹ Sheol from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming. It stirs
      up the departed spirits for you, even all the rulers of the earth. It has raised
      up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. '
    10: '¹⁰ They all will answer and ask you, “Have you also become as weak as we
      are? Have you become like us?” '
    11: "¹¹ Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, with the sound of your stringed instruments.\
      \ Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you. \n"
    12: '¹² How you have fallen from heaven, shining one, son of the dawn! How you
      are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! '
    13: '¹³ You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne
      above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! '
    14: '¹⁴ I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like
      the Most High!” '
    15: '¹⁵ Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit. '
    16: '¹⁶ Those who see you will stare at you. They will ponder you, saying, “Is
      this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms, '
    17: "¹⁷ who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities, who didn’t\
      \ release his prisoners to their home?” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ All the kings of the nations sleep in glory, everyone in his own house. '
    19: '¹⁹ But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed
      with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones
      of the pit; like a dead body trodden under foot. '
    20: "²⁰ You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land.\
      \ You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named\
      \ forever. \n"
    21: '²¹ Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their
      fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of
      the world with cities. '
    22: '²² “I will rise up against them,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and cut off from
      Babylon name and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says Yahweh. '
    23: "²³ “I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water.\
      \ I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall
      it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: '
    25: '²⁵ that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on
      my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders. '
    26: '²⁶ This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand
      that is stretched out over all the nations. '
    27: "²⁷ For Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched\
      \ out, and who can turn it back?” \n"
    28: "²⁸ This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Don’t rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you
      is broken; for out of the serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit
      will be a fiery flying serpent. '
    30: "³⁰ The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety;\
      \ and I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed. \n"
    31: "³¹ Howl, gate! Cry, city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for\
      \ smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks. \n"
    32: ³² What will they answer the messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded
      Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people will take refuge.
  15:
    1: "¹ The burden of Moab.\nFor in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought\
      \ to nothing. For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. "
    2: '² They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep.
      Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every
      beard is cut off. '
    3: '³ In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets
      and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly. '
    4: '⁴ Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore
      the armed men of Moab cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them. '
    5: '⁵ My heart cries out for Moab! Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah;
      for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim,
      they raise up a cry of destruction. '
    6: '⁶ For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away,
      the tender grass fails, there is no green thing. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that
      which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows. '
    8: '⁸ For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, its wailing to Eglaim,
      and its wailing to Beer Elim. '
    9: ⁹ For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon,
      a lion on those of Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land.
  16:
    1: '¹ Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to
      the mountain of the daughter of Zion. '
    2: '² For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the
      daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon. '
    3: '³ Give counsel! Execute justice! Make your shade like the night in the middle
      of the noonday! Hide the outcasts! Don’t betray the fugitive! '
    4: '⁴ Let my outcasts dwell with you! As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from
      the face of the destroyer. For the extortionist is brought to nothing. Destruction
      ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land. '
    5: "⁵ A throne will be established in loving kindness. One will sit on it in truth,\
      \ in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance,
      his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore Moab will wail for Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for
      the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, utterly stricken. '
    8: '⁸ For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of
      the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer,
      which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed
      over the sea. '
    9: '⁹ Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah.
      I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits
      and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen. '
    10: '¹⁰ Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the
      vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread
      out wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for
      Kir Heres. '
    12: "¹² It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself\
      \ on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past. '
    14: ¹⁴ But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as a worker bound
      by contract would count them, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt,
      with all his great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.”
  17:
    1: "¹ The burden of Damascus.\n“Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city,\
      \ and it will be a ruinous heap. "
    2: '² The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks, which shall lie
      down, and no one shall make them afraid. '
    3: "³ The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and\
      \ the remnant of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,”\
      \ says Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    4: '⁴ “It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and
      the fatness of his flesh will become lean. '
    5: '⁵ It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps
      the grain. Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim. '
    6: '⁶ Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two
      or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost
      branches of a fruitful tree,” says Yahweh, the God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect
      for the Holy One of Israel. '
    8: '⁸ They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall
      they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherah poles, or
      the incense altars. '
    9: '⁹ In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the
      woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children
      of Israel; and it will be a desolation. '
    10: '¹⁰ For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered
      the rock of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out
      foreign seedlings. '
    11: "¹¹ In the day of your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make\
      \ your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate\
      \ sorrow. \n"
    12: '¹² Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas;
      and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters! '
    13: '¹³ The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke
      them, and they will flee far off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains
      before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm. '
    14: ¹⁴ At evening, behold, terror! Before the morning, they are no more. This
      is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.
  18:
    1: '¹ Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; '
    2: '² that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters,
      saying, “Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people
      awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down,
      whose land the rivers divide!” '
    3: "³ All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when a\
      \ banner is lifted up on the mountains, look! When the trumpet is blown, listen!\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ For Yahweh said to me, “I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place,
      like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” '
    5: '⁵ For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes
      a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will
      cut down and take away the spreading branches. '
    6: '⁶ They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and
      for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will eat them in the summer,
      and all the animals of the earth will eat them in the winter. '
    7: ⁷ In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies from a people
      tall and smooth, even from a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation
      that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place
      of the name of Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.
  19:
    1: "¹ The burden of Egypt.\n“Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes\
      \ to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of\
      \ Egypt will melt within it. "
    2: '² I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight
      everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against
      city, and kingdom against kingdom. '
    3: '³ The spirit of the Egyptians will fail within them. I will destroy their
      counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits,
      and the wizards. '
    4: "⁴ I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king\
      \ will rule over them,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    5: '⁵ The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become
      dry. '
    6: '⁶ The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and
      dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away. '
    7: '⁷ The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields
      of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more. '
    8: '⁸ The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn,
      and those who spread nets on the waters will languish. '
    9: '⁹ Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth,
      will be confounded. '
    10: "¹⁰ The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will\
      \ be grieved in soul. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors
      of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the
      wise, the son of ancient kings?” '
    12: '¹² Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know
      what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt. '
    13: '¹³ The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived.
      They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes. '
    14: '¹⁴ Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they
      have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers
      in his vomit. '
    15: '¹⁵ Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch
      or rush, may do. '
    16: '¹⁶ In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear
      because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies’s hand, which he shakes over them. '
    17: '¹⁷ The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention
      is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which
      he determines against it. '
    18: "¹⁸ In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak\
      \ the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called\
      \ “The city of destruction.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the middle of the land
      of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border. '
    20: '²⁰ It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land
      of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send
      them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them. '
    21: '²¹ Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that
      day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow
      to Yahweh, and will perform it. '
    22: "²² Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh,\
      \ and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them. \n"
    23: "²³ In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian\
      \ shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will\
      \ worship with the Assyrians. \n"
    24: '²⁴ In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing
      within the earth; '
    25: ²⁵ because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my
      people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”
  20:
    1: '¹ In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria
      sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it; '
    2: '² at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen
      the sackcloth from off your waist, and take your sandals from off your feet.”
      He did so, walking naked and barefoot. '
    3: '³ Yahweh said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years
      for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia, '
    4: '⁴ so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles
      of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered,
      to the shame of Egypt. '
    5: '⁵ They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation,
      and of Egypt their glory. '
    6: ⁶ The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is
      our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria.
      And we, how will we escape?’”
  21:
    1: "¹ The burden of the wilderness of the sea.\nAs whirlwinds in the South sweep\
      \ through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land. "
    2: '² A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously,
      and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s
      sighing. '
    3: '³ Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like
      the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I am
      so dismayed that I can’t see. '
    4: '⁴ My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired
      has been turned into trembling for me. '
    5: '⁵ They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up,
      you princes, oil the shield! '
    6: '⁶ For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees. '
    7: '⁷ When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of
      camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.” '
    8: '⁸ He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the
      daytime, and every night I stay at my post. '
    9: "⁹ Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen,\
      \ fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the\
      \ ground. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard\
      \ from Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The burden of Dumah.\nOne calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of\
      \ the night? Watchman, what of the night?” "
    12: "¹² The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will\
      \ inquire, inquire. Come back again.” \n"
    13: "¹³ The burden on Arabia.\nIn the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans\
      \ of Dedanites. "
    14: '¹⁴ They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land
      of Tema met the fugitives with their bread. '
    15: '¹⁵ For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent
      bow, and from the heat of battle. '
    16: '¹⁶ For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract
      would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail, '
    17: ¹⁷ and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children
      of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”
  22:
    1: "¹ The burden of the valley of vision.\nWhat ails you now, that you have all\
      \ gone up to the housetops? "
    2: '² You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain
      are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. '
    3: '³ All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All
      who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away. '
    4: "⁴ Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor\
      \ to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people. \n"
    5: '⁵ For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from
      the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the
      walls, and a crying to the mountains.” '
    6: '⁶ Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered
      the shield. '
    7: '⁷ Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves
      in array at the gate. '
    8: '⁸ He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor
      in the house of the forest. '
    9: '⁹ You saw the breaches of David’s city, that they were many; and you gathered
      together the waters of the lower pool. '
    10: '¹⁰ You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to
      fortify the wall. '
    11: "¹¹ You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old\
      \ pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect\
      \ for him who planned it long ago. \n"
    12: '¹² In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning,
      to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth; '
    13: '¹³ and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating
      meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” '
    14: "¹⁴ Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, “Surely this iniquity will\
      \ not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord, Yahweh of Armies says, “Go, get yourself to this treasurer,
      even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say, '
    16: '¹⁶ ‘What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb
      here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself
      in the rock!” '
    17: '¹⁷ Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he
      will grasp you firmly. '
    18: '¹⁸ He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into
      a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will
      be, you disgrace of your lord’s house. '
    19: "¹⁹ I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your\
      \ station. \n"
    20: '²⁰ It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son
      of Hilkiah, '
    21: '²¹ and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt.
      I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. '
    22: '²² I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and
      no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open. '
    23: '²³ I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne
      of glory to his father’s house. '
    24: '²⁴ They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring
      and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers. '
    25: ²⁵ “In that day,” says Yahweh of Armies, “the nail that was fastened in a
      sure place will give way. It will be cut down and fall. The burden that was
      on it will be cut off, for Yahweh has spoken it.”
  23:
    1: "¹ The burden of Tyre.\nHowl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste,\
      \ so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed\
      \ to them. "
    2: '² Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon
      that pass over the sea have replenished. '
    3: '³ On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her
      revenue. She was the market of nations. '
    4: '⁴ Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying,
      “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men,
      nor brought up virgins.” '
    5: '⁵ When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of
      Tyre. '
    6: '⁶ Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast! '
    7: "⁷ Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet\
      \ carried her far away to travel? \n"
    8: '⁸ Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants
      are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth? '
    9: '⁹ Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring
      into contempt all the honorable of the earth. '
    10: '¹⁰ Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no
      restraint any more. '
    11: '¹¹ He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms.
      Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan’s strongholds. '
    12: "¹² He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of\
      \ Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people didn’t exist. The Assyrians
      founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers.
      They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin. '
    14: '¹⁴ Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste! '
    15: '¹⁵ It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years,
      according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be
      to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute. '
    16: '¹⁶ Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten.
      Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered. '
    17: '¹⁷ It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre.
      She will return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms
      of the world on the surface of the earth. '
    18: ¹⁸ Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh. It will not be
      treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before
      Yahweh, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
  24:
    1: '¹ Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down,
      and scatters its inhabitants. '
    2: '² It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant,
      so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer,
      so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker
      of interest, so with the giver of interest. '
    3: '³ The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has
      spoken this word. '
    4: '⁴ The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The
      lofty people of the earth languish. '
    5: '⁵ The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed
      the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein
      are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few
      men are left. '
    7: '⁷ The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh. '
    8: '⁸ The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The
      joy of the harp ceases. '
    9: '⁹ They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those
      who drink it. '
    10: '¹⁰ The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man
      may come in. '
    11: '¹¹ There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened.
      The mirth of the land is gone. '
    12: '¹² The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction. '
    13: "¹³ For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of\
      \ an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh.
      They cry aloud from the sea. '
    15: '¹⁵ Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God
      of Israel, in the islands of the sea! '
    16: "¹⁶ From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the\
      \ righteous!\nBut I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous\
      \ have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously. "
    17: '¹⁷ Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabit the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall
      into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken
      in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the
      earth tremble. '
    19: '¹⁹ The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken
      violently. '
    20: "²⁰ The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth\
      \ like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and\
      \ not rise again. \n"
    21: '²¹ It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high
      ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth. '
    22: '²² They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit,
      and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited. '
    23: ²³ Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies
      will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders.
  25:
    1: '¹ Yahweh, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you
      have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness
      and truth. '
    2: '² For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace
      of strangers to be no city. It will never be built. '
    3: '³ Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will
      fear you. '
    4: '⁴ For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in
      his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast
      of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall. '
    5: "⁵ As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as\
      \ the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought\
      \ low. \n"
    6: '⁶ In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice
      meat, a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined
      choice wines. '
    7: '⁷ He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers
      all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. '
    8: "⁸ He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears\
      \ from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off\
      \ all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it. \n"
    9: '⁹ It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for
      him, and he will save us! This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will be
      glad and rejoice in his salvation!” '
    10: "¹⁰ For Yahweh’s hand will rest in this mountain.\nMoab will be trodden down\
      \ in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill. "
    11: '¹¹ He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads
      out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of
      his hands. '
    12: ¹² He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought
      to the ground, even to the dust.
  26:
    1: "¹ In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:\n“We have a strong\
      \ city.\n    God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.\n"
    2: "² Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:\n    the one which\
      \ keeps faith.\n"
    3: "³ You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,\n    because\
      \ he trusts in you.\n"
    4: "⁴ Trust in Yahweh forever;\n    for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.\n"
    5: "⁵ For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.\n    He\
      \ lays it low.\n    He lays it low even to the ground.\n    He brings it even\
      \ to the dust.\n"
    6: "⁶ The foot shall tread it down,\n    even the feet of the poor\n    and the\
      \ steps of the needy.”\n"
    7: "⁷ The way of the just is uprightness.\n    You who are upright make the path\
      \ of the righteous level. \n"
    8: "⁸ Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you.\n   \
      \ Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.\n"
    9: "⁹ With my soul I have desired you in the night.\n    Yes, with my spirit within\
      \ me I will seek you earnestly;\n    for when your judgments are in the earth,\
      \ the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Let favor be shown to the wicked,\n    yet he will not learn righteousness.\n\
      In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,\n    and will not see Yahweh’s\
      \ majesty. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see;\n    but they will\
      \ see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed.\n    Yes, fire will consume\
      \ your adversaries.\n"
    12: "¹² Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us,\n    for you have also done all\
      \ our work for us.\n"
    13: "¹³ Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,\n \
      \   but we will only acknowledge your name.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The dead shall not live.\n    The departed spirits shall not rise.\nTherefore\
      \ you have visited and destroyed them,\n    and caused all memory of them to\
      \ perish.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.\n    You have increased the nation!\n\
      You are glorified!\n    You have enlarged all the borders of the land. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.\n    They poured out a prayer\
      \ when your chastening was on them.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Just as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery,\n\
      \    is in pain and cries out in her pangs,\n    so we have been before you,\
      \ Yahweh.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ We have been with child.\n    We have been in pain.\nWe gave birth, it\
      \ seems, only to wind.\n    We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;\n\
      \    neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your dead shall live.\n    My dead bodies shall arise.\nAwake and sing,\
      \ you who dwell in the dust;\n    for your dew is like the dew of herbs,\n \
      \   and the earth will cast out the departed spirits. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Come, my people, enter into your rooms,\n    and shut your doors behind\
      \ you.\nHide yourself for a little moment,\n    until the indignation is past.\n"
    21: "²¹ For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of\
      \ the earth for their iniquity.\n    The earth also will disclose her blood,\
      \ and will no longer cover her slain."
  27:
    1: "¹ In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish\
      \ leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he\
      \ will kill the dragon that is in the sea. \n"
    2: '² In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard! '
    3: '³ I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage
      it, I will keep it night and day. '
    4: '⁴ Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle!
      I would march on them and I would burn them together. '
    5: "⁵ Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me.\
      \ Let him make peace with me.” \n"
    6: '⁶ In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They
      will fill the surface of the world with fruit. '
    7: '⁷ Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed
      like those who killed them were killed? '
    8: '⁸ In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed
      them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. '
    9: '⁹ Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all
      the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar
      as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the
      incense altars shall rise no more. '
    10: '¹⁰ For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken,
      like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and
      consume its branches. '
    11: "¹¹ When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will\
      \ come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore\
      \ he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them\
      \ will show them no favor. \n"
    12: "¹² It will happen in that day that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream\
      \ of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one,\
      \ children of Israel. \n"
    13: ¹³ It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those
      who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts
      in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain
      at Jerusalem.
  28:
    1: '¹ Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading
      flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of
      those who are overcome with wine! '
    2: '² Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying
      storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down
      to the earth with his hand. '
    3: '³ The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot. '
    4: '⁴ The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile
      valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks
      and eats as soon as he sees it. '
    5: '⁵ In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory and a diadem
      of beauty to the residue of his people, '
    6: "⁶ and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those\
      \ who turn back the battle at the gate. \n"
    7: '⁷ They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and
      the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger
      with strong drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment. '
    8: "⁸ For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness. \n"
    9: '⁹ Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those
      who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? '
    10: "¹⁰ For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on\
      \ line; here a little, there a little. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language, '
    12: '¹² to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to the weary,”
      and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear. '
    13: "¹³ Therefore Yahweh’s word will be to them precept on precept, precept on\
      \ precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they\
      \ may go, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem: '
    15: '¹⁵ “Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are
      in agreement with Sheol. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t
      come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under
      falsehood.’” '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation
      a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who
      believes shall not act hastily. '
    17: '¹⁷ I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line.
      The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the
      hiding place. '
    18: '¹⁸ Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol
      shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will
      be trampled down by it. '
    19: '¹⁹ As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning
      it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror
      to understand the message.” '
    20: '²⁰ For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow
      to wrap oneself in. '
    21: '²¹ For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the
      valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass
      his act, his extraordinary act. '
    22: "²² Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I\
      \ have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the\
      \ whole earth. \n"
    23: '²³ Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech! '
    24: '²⁴ Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil
      and breaking the clods? '
    25: '²⁵ When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter
      the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place,
      and the spelt in its place? '
    26: '²⁶ For his God instructs him in right judgment and teaches him. '
    27: '²⁷ For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart
      wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the
      cumin with a rod. '
    28: '²⁸ Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although
      he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it. '
    29: ²⁹ This also comes out from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel,
      and excellent in wisdom.
  29:
    1: '¹ Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let
      the feasts come around; '
    2: '² then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation.
      She shall be to me as an altar hearth. '
    3: '³ I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you
      with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you. '
    4: "⁴ You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech\
      \ will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar\
      \ spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust. \n"
    5: '⁵ But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude
      of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant,
      suddenly. '
    6: '⁶ She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with
      great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire. '
    7: '⁷ The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who
      fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream,
      a vision of the night. '
    8: "⁸ It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes,\
      \ and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold,\
      \ he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty.\
      \ The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like\
      \ that. \n"
    9: '⁹ Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not
      with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. '
    10: '¹⁰ For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed
      your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers. '
    11: '¹¹ All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed,
      which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he
      says, “I can’t, for it is sealed;” '
    12: "¹² and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this,\
      \ please;” and he says, “I can’t read.” \n"
    13: '¹³ The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and honors
      me with their lips, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their
      fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught; '
    14: "¹⁴ therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people,\
      \ even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will\
      \ perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose deeds
      are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?” '
    16: "¹⁶ You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay;\
      \ that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;”\
      \ or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful
      field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest? '
    18: '¹⁸ In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of
      the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. '
    19: '¹⁹ The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among
      men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. '
    20: '²⁰ For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all
      those who are alert to do evil are cut off— '
    21: "²¹ who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for one who\
      \ reproves in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob:
      “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale. '
    23: '²³ But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of
      him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
      and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. '
    24: ²⁴ They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble
      will receive instruction.”
  30:
    1: '¹ “Woe to the rebellious children”, says Yahweh, “who take counsel, but not
      from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may add
      sin to sin, '
    2: '² who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice, to strengthen
      themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt! '
    3: '³ Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in
      the shadow of Egypt your confusion. '
    4: '⁴ For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes. '
    5: "⁵ They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that\
      \ are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.” \n"
    6: "⁶ The burden of the animals of the South.\nThrough the land of trouble and\

      \ they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures\
      \ on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people. "
    7: '⁷ For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I have called her
      Rahab who sits still. '
    8: '⁸ Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that
      it may be for the time to come forever and ever. '
    9: '⁹ For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear
      Yahweh’s law; '
    10: '¹⁰ who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to
      us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits. '
    11: '¹¹ Get out of the way. Turn away from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel
      to cease from before us.” '
    12: '¹² Therefore the Holy One of Israel says, “Because you despise this word,
      and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it, '
    13: '¹³ therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling
      out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant. '
    14: "¹⁴ He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces\
      \ without sparing, so that there won’t be found among the broken pieces a piece\
      \ good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved
      in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.”
      You refused, '
    16: '¹⁶ but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee;
      and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift. '
    17: "¹⁷ One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you\
      \ will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like\
      \ a banner on a hill. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore
      he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is a God of justice.
      Blessed are all those who wait for him. '
    19: '¹⁹ For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more.
      He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you,
      he will answer you. '
    20: '²⁰ Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction,
      yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers; '
    21: '²¹ and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your
      ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.” '
    22: "²² You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and\
      \ the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an\
      \ unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!” \n"
    23: '²³ He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground;
      and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that
      day, your livestock will feed in large pastures. '
    24: '²⁴ The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat
      savory feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork. '
    25: '²⁵ There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and
      on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. '
    26: "²⁶ Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and\
      \ the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven\
      \ days, in the day that Yahweh binds up the fracture of his people, and heals\
      \ the wound they were struck with. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Behold, Yahweh’s name comes from far away, burning with his anger, and
      in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation. His tongue is as a
      devouring fire. '
    28: '²⁸ His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck,
      to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. A bridle that leads to ruin
      will be in the jaws of the peoples. '
    29: '²⁹ You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness
      of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh’s mountain, to Israel’s
      Rock. '
    30: '³⁰ Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent
      of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring
      fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones. '
    31: '³¹ For through Yahweh’s voice the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike
      him with his rod. '
    32: '³² Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay on him, will
      be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles,
      brandishing weapons. '
    33: ³³ For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, it is prepared for the
      king. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh’s
      breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
  31:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,\n    and rely on horses,\n \
      \   and trust in chariots because they are many,\n    and in horsemen because\
      \ they are very strong,\n    but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,\n\

    2: "² Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,\n    and will not call back\

    3: "³ Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;\n    and their horses flesh, and\

      \    and he who is helped shall fall,\n    and they all shall be consumed together.\

    4: "⁴ For Yahweh says to me,\n“As the lion and the young lion growling over his\

    5: "⁵ As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.\n    He will\

    6: "⁶ For the fool will speak folly,\n    and his heart will work iniquity,\n\

    7: "⁷ The ways of the scoundrel are evil.\n    He devises wicked plans to destroy\

    8: "⁸ But the noble devises noble things;\n    and he will continue in noble things.\

    10: "¹⁰ For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;\n   \

    14: "¹⁴ For the palace will be forsaken.\n    The populous city will be deserted.\n\

    2: "² Yahweh, be gracious to us. We have waited for you.\n    Be our strength\

    3: "³ At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.\n    When you lift yourself\

    9: "⁹ The land mourns and languishes.\n    Lebanon is confounded and withers away.\n\

    14: "¹⁴ The sinners in Zion are afraid.\n    Trembling has seized the godless\

    15: "¹⁵ He who walks righteously\n    and speaks blamelessly,\n    he who despises\

    20: "²⁰ Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.\n    Your eyes will\

    23: "²³ Your rigging is untied.\n    They couldn’t strengthen the foot of their\

    24: "²⁴ The inhabitant won’t say, “I am sick.”\n    The people who dwell therein\

  34:

    7: "⁷ The wild oxen will come down with them,\n    and the young bulls with the\

    11: "¹¹ But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.\n    The owl and the\

    12: "¹² They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;\n\

    16: "¹⁶ Search in the book of Yahweh, and read:\n    not one of these will be\

  36:
    1: '¹ Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria
      attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. '
    2: '² The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah
      with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s
      field highway. '
    3: "³ Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna\
      \ the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him. \n"
    4: '⁴ Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of

    5: '⁵ I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now
      in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? '
    6: '⁶ Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which
      if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh
      king of Egypt to all who trust in him. '
    7: '⁷ But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ isn’t that he whose high
      places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to
      Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar?’” '
    8: '⁸ Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and
      I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders
      on them. '
    9: '⁹ How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s

    10: "¹⁰ Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh\

    12: '¹² But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to

    13: '¹³ Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language,

    19: '¹⁹ Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
      Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? '
    20: "²⁰ Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered\
      \ their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of\
      \ my hand?’” \n"
    21: "²¹ But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment\
      \ was, “Don’t answer him.” \n"
    22: ²² Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna
      the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with
      their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
  37:
    1: '¹ When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth,
      and went into Yahweh’s house. '
    2: '² He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and
      the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the
      son of Amoz. '
    3: '³ They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke,
      and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength
      to give birth. '
    4: "⁴ It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king\
      \ of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the\
      \ words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the\
      \ remnant that is left.’” \n"
    5: "⁵ So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. \n"
    6: '⁶ Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of
      the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
      have blasphemed me. '
    7: "⁷ Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return\
      \ to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah,
      for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. '
    9: '⁹ He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to
      fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your
      God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the
      hand of the king of Assyria.” '
    11: '¹¹ Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands,
      by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered? '
    12: '¹² Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed,
      Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? '
    13: "¹³ Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the\
      \ city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read
      it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh. '
    15: '¹⁵ Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim,
      you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have
      made heaven and earth. '
    17: '¹⁷ Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold. Hear
      all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God. '
    18: '¹⁸ Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and
      their land, '
    19: '¹⁹ and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the
      work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. '
    20: "²⁰ Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms\
      \ of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God
      of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, '
    22: '²² this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him. The virgin daughter
      of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken
      her head at you. '
    23: '²³ Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your
      voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. '
    24: '²⁴ By your servants, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude
      of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost
      parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees.
      I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field. '
    25: "²⁵ I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up\
      \ all the rivers of Egypt.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ “‘Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient
      times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified
      cities, turning them into ruinous heaps. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded.
      They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass
      on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown. '
    28: '²⁸ But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your
      raging against me. '
    29: "²⁹ Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come\
      \ up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in\
      \ your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “‘This shall be the sign to you. You will eat this year that which grows
      of itself, and in the second year that which springs from it; and in the third
      year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. '
    31: '³¹ The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root
      downward, and bear fruit upward. '
    32: "³² For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape\
      \ from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.’ \n"
    33: '³³ “Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come
      to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with
      shield, nor cast up a mound against it. '
    34: '³⁴ He will return the way that he came, and he won’t come to this city,’
      says Yahweh. '
    35: "³⁵ ‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant\
      \ David’s sake.’” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Then Yahweh’s angel went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand
      men in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold,
      these were all dead bodies. '
    37: '³⁷ So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh,
      and stayed there. '
    38: ³⁸ As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer
      his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
      Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
  38:
    1: "¹ In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the\
      \ son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in\
      \ order, for you will die, and not live.’” \n"
    2: '² Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, '
    3: "³ and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you\
      \ in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your\
      \ sight.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Yahweh’s word came to Isaiah, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I
      have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years
      to your life. '
    6: '⁶ I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria,
      and I will defend this city. '
    7: '⁷ This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing
      that he has spoken. '
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the\
      \ sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.”’” So the sun\
      \ returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down. \n"
    9: "⁹ The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered\
      \ of his sickness. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.\n    I\
      \ am deprived of the residue of my years.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ I said, “I won’t see Yah,\n    Yah in the land of the living.\n    I will\
      \ see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.\n"
    12: "¹² My dwelling is removed,\n    and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s\
      \ tent.\nI have rolled up my life like a weaver.\n    He will cut me off from\
      \ the loom.\n    From day even to night you will make an end of me.\n"
    13: "¹³ I waited patiently until morning.\n    He breaks all my bones like a lion.\n\
      \    From day even to night you will make an end of me.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I chattered like a swallow or a crane.\n    I moaned like a dove.\n  \
      \  My eyes weaken looking upward.\n    Lord, I am oppressed.\n    Be my security.”\n"
    15: "¹⁵ What will I say?\n    He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.\n\
      \    I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Lord, men live by these things;\n    and my spirit finds life in all of\
      \ them:\n    you restore me, and cause me to live.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Behold, for peace I had great anguish,\n    but you have in love for my\
      \ soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;\n    for you have cast all my\
      \ sins behind your back.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For Sheol can’t praise you.\n    Death can’t celebrate you.\nThose who\
      \ go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today.\n    The father\
      \ shall make known your truth to the children.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Yahweh will save me.\n    Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed\
      \ instruments all the days of our life in Yahweh’s house. \n"
    21: '²¹ Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice
      on the boil, and he shall recover.” '
    22: ²² Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to Yahweh’s
      house?”
  39:
    1: '¹ At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
      letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had
      recovered. '
    2: '² Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious
      things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the
      house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing
      in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them. '
    3: "³ Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did\
      \ these men say? From where did they come to you?”\nHezekiah said, “They have\
      \ come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?”\nHezekiah answered,\
      \ “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures\
      \ that I have not shown them.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies: '
    6: '⁶ ‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which
      your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing
      will be left,’ says Yahweh. '
    7: "⁷ ‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father,\
      \ and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’” \n"
    8: ⁸ Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.”
      He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”
  40:
    1: '¹ “Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God. '
    2: "² “Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her warfare is\
      \ accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Yahweh’s\
      \ hand double for all her sins.” \n"
    3: "³ The voice of one who calls out,\n    “Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness!\n\
      \    Make a level highway in the desert for our God.\n"
    4: "⁴ Every valley shall be exalted,\n    and every mountain and hill shall be\

      \ plain.\n"
    5: "⁵ Yahweh’s glory shall be revealed,\n    and all flesh shall see it together;\n\
      \    for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ The voice of one saying, “Cry!”\n    One said, “What shall I cry?”\n“All\

    7: "⁷ The grass withers,\n    the flower fades,\n    because Yahweh’s breath blows\
      \ on it.\n    Surely the people are like grass.\n"
    8: "⁸ The grass withers,\n    the flower fades;\n    but the word of our God stands\

    9: "⁹ You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.\n    You who tell\

    15: "¹⁵ Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket,\n    and are regarded\

    19: "¹⁹ A workman has cast an image,\n    and the goldsmith overlays it with gold,\n\

  52:
    1: "¹ Awake, awake! Put on your strength, Zion.\n    Put on your beautiful garments,\

    2: "² Shake yourself from the dust!\n    Arise, sit up, Jerusalem!\n    Release\
      \ yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion! \n"
    3: "³ For Yahweh says, “You were sold for nothing;\n    and you will be redeemed\

    4: "⁴ For the Lord Yahweh says:\n“My people went down at the first into Egypt\
      \ to live there:\n    and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Now therefore, what do I do here,” says Yahweh,\n    “seeing that my people\

    8: "⁸ Your watchmen lift up their voice.\n    Together they sing;\n    for they\

    14: "¹⁴ Just as many were astonished at you—\n    his appearance was marred more\
      \ than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—\n"
    15: "¹⁵ so he will cleanse many nations.\n    Kings will shut their mouths at\
      \ him;\n    for they will see that which had not been told them,\n    and they\

  53:
    1: "¹ Who has believed our message?\n    To whom has Yahweh’s arm been revealed?\n"
    2: "² For he grew up before him as a tender plant,\n    and as a root out of dry\

      \ beauty that we should desire him.\n"
    3: "³ He was despised\n    and rejected by men,\na man of suffering\n    and acquainted\
      \ with disease.\nHe was despised as one from whom men hide their face;\n   \
      \ and we didn’t respect him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Surely he has borne our sickness\n    and carried our suffering;\nyet we\

    5: "⁵ But he was pierced for our transgressions.\n    He was crushed for our iniquities.\n\

    7: "⁷ He was oppressed,\n    yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.\n\
      As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,\n    and as a sheep that before its\
      \ shearers is silent,\n    so he didn’t open his mouth.\n"
    8: "⁸ He was taken away by oppression and judgment.\n    As for his generation,\n\
      \    who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living\n    and\

    10: "¹⁰ Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.\n    He has caused him to suffer.\n\
      When you make his soul an offering for sin,\n    he will see his offspring.\n\
      He will prolong his days\n    and Yahweh’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.\n"
    11: "¹¹ After the suffering of his soul,\n    he will see the light and be satisfied.\n\
      My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;\n    and\
      \ he will bear their iniquities.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore I will give him a portion with the great.\n    He will divide\

      \  and was counted with the transgressors;\nyet he bore the sins of many\n \
      \   and made intercession for the transgressors."
  54:
    1: "¹ “Sing, barren, you who didn’t give birth;\n    break out into singing, and\
      \ cry aloud, you who didn’t travail with child:\n    for more are the children\

    2: "² “Enlarge the place of your tent,\n    and let them stretch out the curtains\
      \ of your habitations;\n    don’t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen\

    3: "³ For you will spread out on the right hand and on the left;\n    and your\

    4: "⁴ “Don’t be afraid, for you will not be ashamed.\n    Don’t be confounded,\

    5: "⁵ For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name.\n    The Holy\
      \ One of Israel is your Redeemer.\n    He will be called the God of the whole\
      \ earth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,\n  \

    7: "⁷ “For a small moment I have forsaken you,\n    but I will gather you with\

    8: "⁸ In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment,\n    but with\

    9: "⁹ “For this is like the waters of Noah to me;\n    for as I have sworn that\

      \ I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the mountains may depart,\n    and the hills be removed;\nbut my loving\

    13: "¹³ All your children will be taught by Yahweh;\n    and your children’s peace\

    14: "¹⁴ You will be established in righteousness.\n    You will be far from oppression,\n\

    15: "¹⁵ Behold, they may gather together, but not by me.\n    Whoever gathers\

    16: "¹⁶ “Behold, I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame,\n\

    17: "¹⁷ No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;\n    and you will condemn\

  55:
    1: "¹ “Hey! Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters!\n    Come, he who has no\

    10: "¹⁰ For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,\n    and doesn’t\

  56:
    1: "¹ Yahweh says,\n“Maintain justice\n    and do what is right,\nfor my salvation\

    5: "⁵ I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better\

    11: "¹¹ Yes, the dogs are greedy.\n    They can never have enough.\nThey are shepherds\

      \ in obscurity.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ We grope for the wall like the blind.\n    Yes, we grope as those who\

      \ we know them:\n"
    13: "¹³ transgressing and denying Yahweh,\n    and turning away from following\

    14: "¹⁴ Justice is turned away backward,\n    and righteousness stands far away;\n\

    15: "¹⁵ Yes, truth is lacking;\n    and he who departs from evil makes himself\
      \ a prey. \nYahweh saw it,\n    and it displeased him that there was no justice.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He saw that there was no man,\n    and wondered that there was no intercessor.\n\
      Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;\n    and his righteousness sustained\
      \ him.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He put on righteousness as a breastplate,\n    and a helmet of salvation\
      \ on his head.\nHe put on garments of vengeance for clothing,\n    and was clad\

    9: "⁹ In all their affliction he was afflicted,\n    and the angel of his presence\

      \ destroy in all my holy mountain,”\n    says Yahweh."
  66:
    1: "¹ Yahweh says,\n“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.\n   \
      \ What kind of house will you build to me?\n    Where will I rest?\n"
    2: "² For my hand has made all these things,\n    and so all these things came\
      \ to be,” says Yahweh:\n“but I will look to this man,\n    even to he who is\
      \ poor and of a contrite spirit,\n    and who trembles at my word.\n"
    3: "³ He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man;\n    he who sacrifices a lamb,\
      \ as he who breaks a dog’s neck;\n    he who offers an offering, as he who offers\
      \ pig’s blood;\n    he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol.\n\
      Yes, they have chosen their own ways,\n    and their soul delights in their\
      \ abominations:\n"
    4: "⁴ I also will choose their delusions,\n    and will bring their fears on them;\n\
      because when I called, no one answered;\n    when I spoke, they didn’t listen;\n\
      but they did that which was evil in my eyes,\n    and chose that in which I\
      \ didn’t delight.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Hear Yahweh’s word,\n    you who tremble at his word:\n“Your brothers who\
      \ hate you,\n    who cast you out for my name’s sake, have said,\n‘Let Yahweh\
      \ be glorified,\n    that we may see your joy;’\n    but it is those who shall\
      \ be disappointed.\n"
    6: "⁶ A voice of tumult from the city,\n    a voice from the temple,\n    a voice\
      \ of Yahweh that repays his enemies what they deserve. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Before she travailed, she gave birth.\n    Before her pain came, she delivered\
      \ a son.\n"
    8: "⁸ Who has heard of such a thing?\n    Who has seen such things?\nShall a land\
      \ be born in one day?\n    Shall a nation be born at once?\nFor as soon as Zion\
      \ travailed,\n    she gave birth to her children.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?” says Yahweh.\n\
      \    “Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?” says your God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her.\n\
      \    Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;\n"
    11: "¹¹ that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts;\n    that\
      \ you may drink deeply,\n    and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.”\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² For Yahweh says, “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,\n \
      \   and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;\n    and you will\
      \ nurse.\nYou will be carried on her side,\n    and will be dandled on her knees.\n"
    13: "¹³ As one whom his mother comforts,\n    so I will comfort you.\n    You\
      \ will be comforted in Jerusalem.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice,\n    and your bones will\
      \ flourish like the tender grass.\nYahweh’s hand will be known among his servants;\n\
      \    and he will have indignation against his enemies. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire,\n    and his chariots will be\
      \ like the whirlwind;\nto render his anger with fierceness,\n    and his rebuke\
      \ with flames of fire.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh;\n\
      \    and those slain by Yahweh will be many. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens,\
      \ behind one in the middle, eating pig’s meat, abominable things, and the mouse,\
      \ they shall come to an end together,” says Yahweh. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will\
      \ gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my glory.\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape of them
      to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan,
      to far-away islands, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory; and
      they shall declare my glory among the nations. '
    20: '²⁰ They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering
      to Yahweh, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to my
      holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their
      offering in a clean vessel into Yahweh’s house. '
    21: "²¹ Of them I will also select priests and Levites,” says Yahweh. \n"
    22: '²² “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
      before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name shall remain. '
    23: '²³ It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath
      to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says Yahweh. '
    24: ²⁴ “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed
      against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and
      they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
