Nehemiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.\nNow in the month Chislev, in\
      \ the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the palace, "
    2: '² Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I
      asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and
      concerning Jerusalem. '
    3: "³ They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the\
      \ province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also\
      \ broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.” \n"
    4: '⁴ When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days;
      and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, '
    5: '⁵ and said, “I beg you, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God,
      who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his
      commandments: '
    6: '⁶ Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to
      the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night,
      for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children
      of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have
      sinned. '
    7: "⁷ We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments,\
      \ nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying,
      ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples; '
    9: "⁹ but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your\
      \ outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them\
      \ from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause\
      \ my name to dwell there.’ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by
      your great power, and by your strong hand. '
    11: "¹¹ Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant,\
      \ and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please\
      \ prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”\n\
      Now I was cup bearer to the king."
  2:
    1: '¹ In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine
      was before him, I picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not
      been sad before in his presence. '
    2: "² The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This\
      \ is nothing else but sorrow of heart.”\nThen I was very much afraid. "
    3: "³ I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be\
      \ sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates\
      \ have been consumed with fire?” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the king said to me, “What is your request?”\nSo I prayed to the God\
      \ of heaven. "
    5: "⁵ I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found\
      \ favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’\
      \ tombs, that I may build it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), “How long will\
      \ your journey be? When will you return?”\nSo it pleased the king to send me,\
      \ and I set a time for him. "
    7: '⁷ Moreover I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given
      me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until
      I come to Judah; '
    8: "⁸ and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give\
      \ me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the\
      \ wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.”\nThe king granted\
      \ my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me. "
    9: '⁹ Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s
      letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. '
    10: '¹⁰ When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard
      of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare
      of the children of Israel. '
    11: '¹¹ So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. '
    12: '¹² I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what
      my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn’t any animal with me,
      except the animal that I rode on. '
    13: '¹³ I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well,
      then to the dung gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken
      down, and its gates were consumed with fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king’s pool, but there was
      no place for the animal that was under me to pass. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then I went up in the night by the brook, and inspected the wall; and
      I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. '
    16: "¹⁶ The rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told\
      \ it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers,\
      \ nor to the rest who did the work. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem
      lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let’s build up the wall
      of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.” '
    18: "¹⁸ I told them about the hand of my God which was good on me, and also about\
      \ the king’s words that he had spoken to me.\nThey said, “Let’s rise up and\
      \ build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem\
      \ the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, “What\
      \ is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?” \n"
    20: ²⁰ Then I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper
      us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion,
      nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.”
  3:
    1: '¹ Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and
      they built the sheep gate. They sanctified it, and set up its doors. They sanctified
      it even to the tower of Hammeah, to the tower of Hananel. '
    2: "² Next to him the men of Jericho built. Next to them Zaccur the son of Imri\
      \ built. \n"
    3: '³ The sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate. They laid its beams, and set
      up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. '
    4: '⁴ Next to them, Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz made repairs.
      Next to them, Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel made repairs.
      Next to them, Zadok the son of Baana made repairs. '
    5: "⁵ Next to them, the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles didn’t put their\
      \ necks to the Lord’s work. \n"
    6: '⁶ Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the
      old gate. They laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its
      bars. '
    7: '⁷ Next to them, Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men
      of Gibeon and of Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor beyond the River. '
    8: '⁸ Next to him, Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths, made repairs. Next
      to him, Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they fortified Jerusalem
      even to the wide wall. '
    9: '⁹ Next to them, Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of
      Jerusalem, made repairs. '
    10: '¹⁰ Next to them, Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs across from his
      house. Next to him, Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs. '
    11: '¹¹ Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired
      another portion, and the tower of the furnaces. '
    12: "¹² Next to him, Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district\
      \ of Jerusalem, he and his daughters, made repairs. \n"
    13: "¹³ Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the valley gate. They built\
      \ it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and one thousand cubits\
      \ of the wall to the dung gate. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem\
      \ repaired the dung gate. He built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and\
      \ its bars. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah repaired
      the spring gate. He built it, and covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts,
      and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even
      to the stairs that go down from David’s city. '
    16: '¹⁶ After him, Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of
      Beth Zur, made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David, and to the
      pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty men. '
    17: '¹⁷ After him, the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani made repairs. Next to him,
      Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district. '
    18: '¹⁸ After him, their brothers, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half
      the district of Keilah made repairs. '
    19: '¹⁹ Next to him, Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another
      portion, across from the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall. '
    20: '²⁰ After him, Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion,
      from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. '
    21: '²¹ After him, Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another
      portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house
      of Eliashib. '
    22: '²² After him, the priests, the men of the Plain made repairs. '
    23: '²³ After them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs across from their house.
      After them, Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made repairs beside
      his own house. '
    24: '²⁴ After him, Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another portion, from the
      house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, and to the corner. '
    25: '²⁵ Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall, and
      the tower that stands out from the upper house of the king, which is by the
      court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs. '
    26: '²⁶ (Now the temple servants lived in Ophel, to the place opposite the water
      gate toward the east, and the tower that stands out.) '
    27: "²⁷ After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, opposite the great tower\
      \ that stands out, and to the wall of Ophel. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Above the horse gate, the priests made repairs, everyone across from his
      own house. '
    29: '²⁹ After them, Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house.
      After him, Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate made repairs. '
    30: '³⁰ After him, Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph,
      repaired another portion. After him, Meshullam the son of Berechiah made repairs
      across from his room. '
    31: '³¹ After him, Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths to the house of the temple
      servants, and of the merchants, made repairs opposite the gate of Hammiphkad,
      and to the ascent of the corner. '
    32: ³² Between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate, the goldsmiths and
      the merchants made repairs.
  4:
    1: '¹ But when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and
      was very indignant, and mocked the Jews. '
    2: "² He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are\
      \ these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice?\
      \ Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of\
      \ rubbish, since they are burned?” \n"
    3: "³ Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building,\
      \ if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.” \n"
    4: '⁴ “Hear, our God; for we are despised. Turn back their reproach on their own
      head. Give them up for a plunder in a land of captivity. '
    5: "⁵ Don’t cover their iniquity. Don’t let their sin be blotted out from before\
      \ you; for they have insulted the builders.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height:\
      \ for the people had a mind to work. \n"
    7: '⁷ But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites
      heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the
      breaches began to be filled, they were very angry; '
    8: '⁸ and they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and
      to cause confusion among us. '
    9: '⁹ But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and
      night because of them. '
    10: '¹⁰ Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there
      is much rubble; so that we are not able to build the wall.” '
    11: "¹¹ Our adversaries said, “They will not know or see, until we come in among\
      \ them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.” \n"
    12: "¹² When the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all\
      \ places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore I set guards in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall,
      in the open places. I set the people by family groups with their swords, their
      spears, and their bows. '
    14: "¹⁴ I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the\
      \ rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great\
      \ and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your\
      \ wives, and your houses.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their
      counsel to nothing, all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. '
    16: '¹⁶ From that time forth, half of my servants did the work, and half of them
      held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers
      were behind all the house of Judah. '
    17: '¹⁷ Those who built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves;
      everyone with one of his hands did the work, and with the other held his weapon. '
    18: '¹⁸ Among the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built.
      He who sounded the trumpet was by me. '
    19: '¹⁹ I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people,
      “The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, far from one
      another. '
    20: "²⁰ Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God\
      \ will fight for us.” \n"
    21: '²¹ So we did the work. Half of the people held the spears from the rising
      of the morning until the stars appeared. '
    22: '²² Likewise at the same time I said to the people, “Let everyone with his
      servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us,
      and may labor in the day.” '
    23: ²³ So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard
      who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to
      the water.
  5:
    1: '¹ Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their
      brothers the Jews. '
    2: '² For there were some who said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many.
      Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.” '
    3: '³ There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards,
      and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.” '
    4: '⁴ There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute
      using our fields and our vineyards as collateral. '
    5: "⁵ Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their\
      \ children. Behold, we bring our sons and our daughters into bondage to be servants,\
      \ and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. It is also not in\
      \ our power to help it, because other men have our fields and our vineyards.”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. '
    7: '⁷ Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers,
      and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great
      assembly against them. '
    8: '⁸ I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews
      that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should
      they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to say. '
    9: '⁹ Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the
      fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies? '
    10: '¹⁰ I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please
      let us stop this usury. '
    11: "¹¹ Please restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their\
      \ olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and\
      \ of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them.\
      \ We will do so, even as you say.”\nThen I called the priests, and took an oath\
      \ of them, that they would do according to this promise. "
    13: "¹³ Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from\
      \ his house, and from his labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even may\
      \ he be shaken out and emptied like this.”\nAll the assembly said, “Amen,” and\
      \ praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the
      land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes
      the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread
      of the governor. '
    15: '¹⁵ But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people,
      and took bread and wine from them, plus forty shekels of silver; yes, even their
      servants ruled over the people; but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God. '
    16: '¹⁶ Yes, I also continued in the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land.
      All my servants were gathered there to the work. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred
      fifty men, in addition to those who came to us from among the nations that were
      around us. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep.
      Also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of
      wine. Yet for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage
      was heavy on this people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Remember me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian,
      and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was
      no breach left in it (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in
      the gates) '
    2: "² Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come! Let’s meet together in the\
      \ villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me. \n"
    3: '³ I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t
      come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?” '
    4: '⁴ They sent to me four times like this; and I answered them the same way. '
    5: '⁵ Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an
      open letter in his hand, '
    6: '⁶ in which was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says
      it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building
      the wall. You would be their king, according to these words. '
    7: "⁷ You have also appointed prophets to proclaim of you at Jerusalem, saying,\
      \ ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according\
      \ to these words. Come now therefore, and let’s take counsel together.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but
      you imagine them out of your own heart.” '
    9: "⁹ For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened\
      \ from the work, that it not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel,\
      \ who was shut in at his home; and he said, “Let us meet together in God’s house,\
      \ within the temple, and let’s shut the doors of the temple; for they will come\
      \ to kill you. Yes, in the night they will come to kill you.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is there that, being such as I,
      would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.” '
    12: '¹² I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this
      prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. '
    13: '¹³ He was hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they
      might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me. '
    14: "¹⁴ “Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works,\
      \ and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would\
      \ have put me in fear.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two
      days. '
    16: '¹⁶ When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations that were around us
      were afraid, and they lost their confidence; for they perceived that this work
      was done by our God. '
    17: '¹⁷ Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah,
      and Tobiah’s letters came to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law
      of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of
      Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife. '
    19: ¹⁹ Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him.
      Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
  7:
    1: '¹ Now when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers
      and the singers and the Levites were appointed, '
    2: '² I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the fortress, in charge
      of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. '
    3: "³ I said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun\
      \ is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them:\
      \ and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch,\
      \ with everyone near his house.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the\
      \ houses were not built. \n"
    5: "⁵ My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers,\
      \ and the people, that they might be listed by genealogy. I found the book of\

      the book of the law. '

      on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum,
      Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. '
    5: '⁵ Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all
      the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up. '
    6: "⁶ Then Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God.\nAll the people answered, “Amen,\
      \ Amen,” with the lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshiped\
      \ Yahweh with their faces to the ground. "
    7: '⁷ Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah,
      Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people
      to understand the law; and the people stayed in their place. '
    8: "⁸ They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the\
      \ sense, so that they understood the reading. \n"
    9: '⁹ Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the
      Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, “Today is holy to Yahweh
      your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all the people wept when they heard the
      words of the law. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and\
      \ send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared, for today is holy to our\
      \ Lord. Don’t be grieved, for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Hold your peace, for the\
      \ day is holy. Don’t be grieved.” \n"
    12: "¹² All the people went their way to eat, to drink, to send portions, and\
      \ to celebrate, because they had understood the words that were declared to\
      \ them. \n"
    13: '¹³ On the second day, the heads of fathers’ households of all the people,
      the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Ezra the scribe, to study
      the words of the law. '
    14: '¹⁴ They found written in the law how Yahweh had commanded by Moses that the
      children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month; '
    15: "¹⁵ and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in\
      \ Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and get olive branches, branches\
      \ of wild olive, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees,\
      \ to make temporary shelters, as it is written.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So the people went out, and brought them, and made themselves temporary
      shelters, everyone on the roof of his house, in their courts, in the courts
      of God’s house, in the wide place of the water gate, and in the wide place of
      Ephraim’s gate. '
    17: '¹⁷ All the assembly of those who had come back out of the captivity made
      temporary shelters, and lived in the temporary shelters; for since the days
      of Joshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so.
      There was very great gladness. '
    18: ¹⁸ Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book
      of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was
      a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled
      with fasting, with sackcloth, and dirt on them. '
    2: '² The offspring of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood
      and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. '
    3: '³ They stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh
      their God a fourth part of the day; and a fourth part they confessed, and worshiped
      Yahweh their God. '
    4: "⁴ Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani\
      \ of the Levites stood up on the stairs, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh\
      \ their God. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah,
      Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting
      to everlasting! Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing
      and praise! '
    6: '⁶ You are Yahweh, even you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens,
      with all their army, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all
      that is in them, and you preserve them all. The army of heaven worships you. '
    7: '⁷ You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram, brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees,
      gave him the name of Abraham, '
    8: "⁸ found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give\
      \ the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite,\
      \ and the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your words;\
      \ for you are righteous. \n"
    9: '⁹ “You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by
      the Red Sea, '
    10: '¹⁰ and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants,
      and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly
      against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is today. '
    11: '¹¹ You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle
      of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as
      a stone into the mighty waters. '
    12: "¹² Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of\
      \ fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go. \n"
    13: '¹³ “You also came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and
      gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, '
    14: '¹⁴ and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments,
      statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant, '
    15: "¹⁵ and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought water out\
      \ of the rock for them for their thirst, and commanded them that they should\
      \ go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “But they and our fathers behaved proudly, hardened their neck, didn’t
      listen to your commandments, '
    17: '¹⁷ and refused to obey. They weren’t mindful of your wonders that you did
      among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain
      to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and
      merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake
      them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Yes, when they had made themselves a molded calf, and said, ‘This is your
      God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies; '
    19: '¹⁹ yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness.
      The pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the
      way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way
      in which they should go. '
    20: "²⁰ You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your\
      \ manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst. \n"
    21: '²¹ “Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing.
      Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell. '
    22: '²² Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according
      to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the
      king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. '
    23: "²³ You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought\
      \ them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should\
      \ go in to possess it. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before
      them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands,
      with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as
      they pleased. '
    25: "²⁵ They took fortified cities and a rich land, and possessed houses full\
      \ of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees\
      \ in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves\
      \ in your great goodness. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, cast your
      law behind their back, killed your prophets that testified against them to turn
      them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed
      them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven;
      and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them
      out of the hands of their adversaries. '
    28: '²⁸ But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you
      left them in the hands of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over
      them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many
      times you delivered them according to your mercies, '
    29: '²⁹ and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law.
      Yet they were arrogant, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against
      your ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs,
      stiffened their neck, and would not hear. '
    30: "³⁰ Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your\
      \ Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not listen. Therefore you gave\
      \ them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. \n"
    31: "³¹ “Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you didn’t make a full end of them,\
      \ nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God. \n"
    32: '³² Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who
      keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before
      you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our
      prophets, on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings
      of Assyria to this day. '
    33: '³³ However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly,
      but we have done wickedly. '
    34: '³⁴ Also our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept
      your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which
      you testified against them. '
    35: "³⁵ For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness\
      \ that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them.\
      \ They didn’t turn from their wicked works. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “Behold, we are servants today, and as for the land that you gave to our
      fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it. '
    37: '³⁷ It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because
      of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies and over our livestock, at
      their pleasure, and we are in great distress. '
    38: ³⁸ Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes,
      our Levites, and our priests, seal it.”

      of our God, to the rooms, into the treasure house. '
    39: ³⁹ For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the wave
      offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, to the rooms, where
      the vessels of the sanctuary are, and the priests who minister, with the gatekeepers
      and the singers. We will not forsake the house of our God.
  11:
    1: '¹ The princes of the people lived in Jerusalem. The rest of the people also
      cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine
      parts in the other cities. '
    2: "² The people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell\
      \ in Jerusalem. \n"
    3: '³ Now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem; but in
      the cities of Judah everyone lived in his possession in their cities: Israel,
      the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the children of Solomon’s
      servants. '
    4: '⁴ Some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem.
      Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the

      was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second
      among his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of
      Jeduthun. '
    18: "¹⁸ All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers, who kept
      watch at the gates, were one hundred seventy-two. '
    20: '²⁰ The residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities
      of Judah, everyone in his inheritance. '
    21: "²¹ But the temple servants lived in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over\
      \ the temple servants. \n"
    22: '²² The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani,
      the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of
      Asaph, the singers, over the business of God’s house. '
    23: '²³ For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled
      provision for the singers, as every day required. '
    24: "²⁴ Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah,\
      \ was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people. \n"
    25: '²⁵ As for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah
      lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, in Jekabzeel and
      its villages, '
    26: '²⁶ in Jeshua, in Moladah, Beth Pelet, '

    31: '³¹ The children of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash and

    35: '³⁵ Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. '
    36: ³⁶ Of the Levites, certain divisions in Judah settled in Benjamin’s territory.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the
      son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, '
    2: '² Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, '
    3: '³ Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, '
    4: '⁴ Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, '
    5: '⁵ Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, '
    6: '⁶ Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah, '
    7: "⁷ Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests\
      \ and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua. \n"
    8: '⁸ Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah,
      who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers. '
    9: '⁹ Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers, were close to them according to
      their offices. '
    10: '¹⁰ Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of
      Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada, '
    11: "¹¹ and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father\
      \ of Jaddua. \n"
    12: '¹² In the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers’ households: of
      Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; '
    13: '¹³ of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; '
    14: '¹⁴ of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; '

    20: '²⁰ of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; '
    21: "²¹ of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel. \n"
    22: '²² As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
      Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers’ households; also the priests,
      in the reign of Darius the Persian. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ households, were written in the book
      of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. '
    24: '²⁴ The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of
      Kadmiel, with their brothers close to them, to praise and give thanks, according
      to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch. '
    25: '²⁵ Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were gatekeepers
      keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates. '
    26: "²⁶ These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak,\
      \ and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out
      of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with
      gladness, both with giving thanks, and with singing, with cymbals, stringed
      instruments, and with harps. '
    28: '²⁸ The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the
      plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites; '
    29: '²⁹ also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for
      the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem. '
    30: "³⁰ The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the\
      \ people, and the gates, and the wall. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two
      great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right
      hand on the wall toward the dung gate; '
    32: '³² and after them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah, '
    33: '³³ and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, '
    34: '³⁴ Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, '
    35: '³⁵ and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan,
      the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur,
      the son of Asaph; '
    36: '³⁶ and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel,
      Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and
      Ezra the scribe was before them. '
    37: "³⁷ By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs\
      \ of David’s city, at the ascent of the wall, above David’s house, even to the\
      \ water gate eastward. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after
      them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces,
      even to the wide wall, '
    39: '³⁹ and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate,
      and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate:
      and they stood still in the gate of the guard. '
    40: '⁴⁰ So the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and
      I, and the half of the rulers with me; '
    41: '⁴¹ and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
      and Hananiah, with trumpets; '
    42: '⁴² and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and
      Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. '
    43: "⁴³ They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made\
      \ them rejoice with great joy; and the women and the children also rejoiced;\
      \ so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ On that day, men were appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for
      the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into
      them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law
      for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the
      Levites who served. '
    45: '⁴⁵ They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification,
      and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of
      David, and of Solomon his son. '
    46: '⁴⁶ For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers,
      and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. '
    47: ⁴⁷ All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave
      the portions of the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and
      they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that
      which was for the sons of Aaron.
  13:
    1: '¹ On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people;
      and it was found written in it that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter
      into the assembly of God forever, '
    2: '² because they didn’t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water,
      but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; however our God turned the curse
      into a blessing. '
    3: "³ It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated all the\
      \ mixed multitude from Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the rooms of
      the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah, '
    5: '⁵ had prepared for him a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings,
      the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and
      the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, the singers, and the
      gatekeepers; and the wave offerings for the priests. '
    6: '⁶ But in all this, I was not at Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of
      Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king; and after some days I asked leave
      of the king, '
    7: '⁷ and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done
      for Tobiah, in preparing him a room in the courts of God’s house. '
    8: '⁸ It grieved me severely. Therefore I threw all Tobiah’s household stuff out
      of the room. '
    9: "⁹ Then I commanded, and they cleansed the rooms. I brought into them the vessels\
      \ of God’s house, with the meal offerings and the frankincense again. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them;
      so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had each fled to his
      field. '
    11: '¹¹ Then I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is God’s house forsaken?”
      I gathered them together, and set them in their place. '
    12: '¹² Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil
      to the treasuries. '
    13: "¹³ I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok\
      \ the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son\
      \ of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their\
      \ business was to distribute to their brothers. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds\
      \ that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In those days I saw some men treading wine presses on the Sabbath in Judah,
      bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; also with wine, grapes, figs, and
      all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day;
      and I testified against them in the day in which they sold food. '
    16: '¹⁶ Some men of Tyre also lived there, who brought in fish and all kinds of
      wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil
      thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day? '
    18: "¹⁸ Didn’t your fathers do this, and didn’t our God bring all this evil on\
      \ us, and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the\
      \ Sabbath.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ It came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before
      the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they
      should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over
      the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day. '
    20: '²⁰ So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside of Jerusalem
      once or twice. '
    21: '²¹ Then I testified against them, and said to them, “Why do you stay around
      the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they
      didn’t come on the Sabbath. '
    22: "²² I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they\
      \ should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me for\
      \ this also, my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving\
      \ kindness. \n"
    23: '²³ In those days I also saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of
      Ammon, and of Moab; '
    24: '²⁴ and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak
      in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people. '
    25: '²⁵ I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and
      plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your
      daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. '
    26: '²⁶ Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations
      there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king
      over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin. '
    27: "²⁷ Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against\
      \ our God in marrying foreign women?” \n"
    28: '²⁸ One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law
      to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me. '
    29: "²⁹ Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the\
      \ covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the
      priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work; '
    31: ³¹ and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits.
      Remember me, my God, for good.
