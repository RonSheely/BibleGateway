Joel:
  1:
    1: "¹ Yahweh’s word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. \n"
    2: "² Hear this, you elders,\n    And listen, all you inhabitants of the land.\n\
      Has this ever happened in your days,\n    or in the days of your fathers?\n"
    3: "³ Tell your children about it,\n    and have your children tell their children,\n\
      \    and their children, another generation.\n"
    4: "⁴ What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.\n    What\
      \ the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.\n    What the grasshopper\
      \ has left, the caterpillar has eaten.\n"
    5: "⁵ Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!\n    Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because\
      \ of the sweet wine;\n    for it is cut off from your mouth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.\n    His\
      \ teeth are the teeth of a lion,\n    and he has the fangs of a lioness.\n"
    7: "⁷ He has laid my vine waste,\n    and stripped my fig tree.\n    He has stripped\
      \ its bark, and thrown it away.\n    Its branches are made white.\n"
    8: '⁸ Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth! '
    9: "⁹ The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house.\n\
      \    The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The field is laid waste.\n    The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,\n\
      \    The new wine has dried up,\n    and the oil languishes.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Be confounded, you farmers!\n    Wail, you vineyard keepers;\n    for\
      \ the wheat and for the barley;\n    for the harvest of the field has perished.\n"
    12: "¹² The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered;\n    the pomegranate\
      \ tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,\n    even all of the trees of\
      \ the field are withered;\n    for joy has withered away from the sons of men.\n"
    13: "¹³ Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!\n    Wail, you ministers of the\
      \ altar.\nCome, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God,\n    for\
      \ the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sanctify a fast.\n    Call a solemn assembly.\n    Gather the elders,\n\
      \    and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of Yahweh, your God,\n\
      \    and cry to Yahweh.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Alas for the day!\n    For the day of Yahweh is at hand,\n    and it will\
      \ come as destruction from the Almighty.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes,\n    joy and gladness from the\
      \ house of our God?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seeds rot under their clods.\n    The granaries are laid desolate.\n\
      \    The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ How the animals groan!\n    The herds of livestock are perplexed, because\
      \ they have no pasture.\n    Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yahweh, I cry to you,\n    For the fire has devoured the pastures of the\
      \ wilderness,\n    and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,\n    for the water brooks have\
      \ dried up,\n    And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."
  2:
    1: "¹ Blow the trumpet in Zion,\n    and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!\n\
      Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,\n    for the day of Yahweh comes,\n\
      \    for it is close at hand:\n"
    2: "² A day of darkness and gloominess,\n    a day of clouds and thick darkness.\n\
      As the dawn spreading on the mountains,\n    a great and strong people;\n  \
      \  there has never been the like,\n    neither will there be any more after\
      \ them,\n    even to the years of many generations.\n"
    3: "³ A fire devours before them,\n    and behind them, a flame burns.\nThe land\
      \ is as the garden of Eden before them,\n    and behind them, a desolate wilderness.\n\
      Yes, and no one has escaped them.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,\n    and they run as horsemen.\n"
    5: "⁵ Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,\n  \
      \  like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,\n    like a strong\
      \ people set in battle array.\n"
    6: "⁶ At their presence the peoples are in anguish.\n    All faces have grown\
      \ pale.\n"
    7: "⁷ They run like mighty men.\n    They climb the wall like warriors.\n    They\
      \ each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.\n"
    8: "⁸ Neither does one jostle another;\n    they march everyone in his path,\n\
      \    and they burst through the defenses,\n    and don’t break ranks.\n"
    9: "⁹ They rush on the city.\n    They run on the wall.\n    They climb up into\
      \ the houses.\n    They enter in at the windows like thieves.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The earth quakes before them.\n    The heavens tremble.\n    The sun and\
      \ the moon are darkened,\n    and the stars withdraw their shining.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Yahweh thunders his voice before his army;\n    for his forces are very\
      \ great;\n    for he is strong who obeys his command;\n    for the day of Yahweh\
      \ is great and very awesome,\n    and who can endure it?\n"
    12: "¹² “Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,\n    and\
      \ with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”\n"
    13: "¹³ Tear your heart, and not your garments,\n    and turn to Yahweh, your\
      \ God;\n    for he is gracious and merciful,\n    slow to anger, and abundant\
      \ in loving kindness,\n    and relents from sending calamity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who knows? He may turn and relent,\n    and leave a blessing behind him,\n\
      \    even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Blow the trumpet in Zion!\n    Sanctify a fast.\n    Call a solemn assembly.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Gather the people.\n    Sanctify the assembly.\n    Assemble the elders.\n\
      \    Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.\nLet the bridegroom\
      \ go out of his room,\n    and the bride out of her room.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the\
      \ altar,\n    and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,\n    and don’t give\
      \ your heritage to reproach,\n    that the nations should rule over them.\n\
      Why should they say among the peoples,\n    ‘Where is their God?’”\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,\n    And had pity on his people.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yahweh answered his people,\n    “Behold, I will send you grain, new wine,\
      \ and oil,\n    and you will be satisfied with them;\n    and I will no more\
      \ make you a reproach among the nations.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But I will remove the northern army far away from you,\n    and will drive\
      \ it into a barren and desolate land,\n    its front into the eastern sea,\n\
      \    and its back into the western sea;\n    and its stench will come up,\n\
      \    and its bad smell will rise.”\nSurely he has done great things.\n"
    21: "²¹ Land, don’t be afraid.\n    Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great\
      \ things.\n"
    22: "²² Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;\n    for the pastures of the\
      \ wilderness spring up,\n    for the tree bears its fruit.\n    The fig tree\
      \ and the vine yield their strength. \n"
    23: "²³ “Be glad then, you children of Zion,\n    and rejoice in Yahweh, your\
      \ God;\n    for he gives you the early rain in just measure,\n    and he causes\
      \ the rain to come down for you,\n    the early rain and the latter rain,\n\
      \    as before.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The threshing floors will be full of wheat,\n    and the vats will overflow\
      \ with new wine and oil.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,\n\
      \    the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,\n    my great army,\
      \ which I sent among you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,\n    and will praise the\
      \ name of Yahweh, your God,\n    who has dealt wondrously with you;\n    and\
      \ my people will never again be disappointed.\n"
    27: "²⁷ You will know that I am among Israel,\n    and that I am Yahweh, your\
      \ God, and there is no one else;\n    and my people will never again be disappointed.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;\n\
      \    and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.\n    Your old men will\
      \ dream dreams.\n    Your young men will see visions.\n"
    29: "²⁹ And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,\n    I will\
      \ pour out my Spirit.\n"
    30: "³⁰ I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:\n    blood, fire,\
      \ and pillars of smoke.\n"
    31: "³¹ The sun will be turned into darkness,\n    and the moon into blood,\n\
      \    before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.\n"
    32: "³² It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;\n\
      \    for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,\n  \
      \  as Yahweh has said,\n    and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls."
  3:
    1: "¹ “For, behold, in those days,\n    and in that time,\n    when I restore\
      \ the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,\n"
    2: "² I will gather all nations,\n    and will bring them down into the valley\
      \ of Jehoshaphat;\n    and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,\n\
      \    and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.\n\
      \    They have divided my land,\n"
    3: "³     and have cast lots for my people,\n    and have given a boy for a prostitute,\n\
      \    and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,\n    and all the regions\
      \ of Philistia?\nWill you repay me?\n    And if you repay me,\n    I will swiftly\
      \ and speedily return your repayment on your own head.\n"
    5: "⁵ Because you have taken my silver and my gold,\n    and have carried my finest\
      \ treasures into your temples,\n"
    6: "⁶     and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to\
      \ the sons of the Greeks,\n    that you may remove them far from their border.\n"
    7: "⁷ Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,\n\
      \    and will return your repayment on your own head;\n"
    8: "⁸ and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children\
      \ of Judah,\n    and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,\n    to a faraway\
      \ nation,\n    for Yahweh has spoken it.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim this among the nations:\n    “Prepare for war!\n    Stir up the\
      \ mighty men.\nLet all the warriors draw near.\nLet them come up. "
    10: "¹⁰     Beat your plowshares into swords,\n    and your pruning hooks into\
      \ spears.\n    Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’\n"
    11: "¹¹ Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,\n    and gather yourselves\
      \ together.”\nCause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.\n"
    12: "¹² “Let the nations arouse themselves,\n    and come up to the valley of\
      \ Jehoshaphat;\n    for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.\n"
    13: "¹³ Put in the sickle;\n    for the harvest is ripe.\n    Come, tread, for\
      \ the wine press is full,\n    the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!\n    For the day of\
      \ Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sun and the moon are darkened,\n    and the stars withdraw their shining.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Yahweh will roar from Zion,\n    and thunder from Jerusalem;\n    and\
      \ the heavens and the earth will shake;\n    but Yahweh will be a refuge to\
      \ his people,\n    and a stronghold to the children of Israel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,\n    dwelling in Zion, my\
      \ holy mountain.\nThen Jerusalem will be holy,\n    and no strangers will pass\
      \ through her any more.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ It will happen in that day,\n    that the mountains will drop down sweet\
      \ wine,\n    the hills will flow with milk,\n    all the brooks of Judah will\
      \ flow with waters,\n    and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house,\n\
      \    and will water the valley of Shittim.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Egypt will be a desolation,\n    and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,\n\
      \    for the violence done to the children of Judah,\n    because they have\
      \ shed innocent blood in their land.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But Judah will be inhabited forever,\n    and Jerusalem from generation\
      \ to generation.\n"
    21: "²¹ I will cleanse their blood,\n    that I have not cleansed:\n    for Yahweh\
      \ dwells in Zion.”"
