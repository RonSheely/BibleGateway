Job:
  1:
    1: '¹ There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was
      blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. '
    2: '² And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. '
    3: "³ Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels,\
      \ five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household,\
      \ so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East. \n"
    4: '⁴ And his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on his appointed day,
      and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. '
    5: "⁵ So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would\
      \ send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt\
      \ offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that\
      \ my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before
      the Lord, and Satan also came among them. '
    7: "⁷ And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”\nSo Satan answered\
      \ the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back\
      \ and forth on it.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there\
      \ is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears\
      \ God and shuns evil?” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? '
    10: '¹⁰ Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around
      all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his
      possessions have increased in the land. '
    11: "¹¹ But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will\
      \ surely curse You to Your face!” \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power;\
      \ only do not lay a hand on his person.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking
      wine in their oldest brother’s house; '
    14: '¹⁴ and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys
      feeding beside them, '
    15: "¹⁵ when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed\
      \ the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell\
      \ you!” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of\
      \ God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed\
      \ them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans\
      \ formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed\
      \ the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell\
      \ you!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and
      daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, '
    19: "¹⁹ and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the\
      \ four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead;\
      \ and I alone have escaped to tell you!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the
      ground and worshiped. '
    21: "²¹ And he said:\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked shall I\
      \ return there.\nThe Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;\nBlessed be the\
      \ name of the Lord.” \n"
    22: ²² In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.
  2:
    1: '¹ Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before
      the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. '
    2: "² And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”\nSatan answered the\
      \ Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back\
      \ and forth on it.” \n"
    3: "³ Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there\
      \ is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears\
      \ God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you\
      \ incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man
      has he will give for his life. '
    5: "⁵ But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he\
      \ will surely curse You to Your face!” \n"
    6: "⁶ And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful
      boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. '
    8: "⁸ And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he\
      \ sat in the midst of the ashes. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse\
      \ God and die!” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall\
      \ we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” In all\
      \ this Job did not sin with his lips. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come
      upon him, each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the
      Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together
      to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. '
    12: '¹² And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him,
      they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled
      dust on his head toward heaven. '
    13: ¹³ So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and
      no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.
  3:
    1: '¹ After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. '
    2: "² And Job spoke, and said: \n"
    3: "³ “May the day perish on which I was born,\nAnd the night in which it was\
      \ said,\n‘A male child is conceived.’\n"
    4: "⁴ May that day be darkness;\nMay God above not seek it,\nNor the light shine\
      \ upon it.\n"
    5: "⁵ May darkness and the shadow of death claim it;\nMay a cloud settle on it;\n\
      May the blackness of the day terrify it.\n"
    6: "⁶ As for that night, may darkness seize it;\nMay it not rejoice among the\
      \ days of the year,\nMay it not come into the number of the months.\n"
    7: "⁷ Oh, may that night be barren!\nMay no joyful shout come into it!\n"
    8: "⁸ May those curse it who curse the day,\nThose who are ready to arouse Leviathan.\n"
    9: "⁹ May the stars of its morning be dark;\nMay it look for light, but have none,\n\
      And not see the dawning of the day;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,\nNor hide sorrow\
      \ from my eyes. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Why did I not die at birth?\nWhy did I not perish when I came from the\
      \ womb?\n"
    12: "¹² Why did the knees receive me?\nOr why the breasts, that I should nurse?\n"
    13: "¹³ For now I would have lain still and been quiet,\nI would have been asleep;\n\
      Then I would have been at rest\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With kings and counselors of the earth,\nWho built ruins for themselves,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Or with princes who had gold,\nWho filled their houses with silver;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,\nLike infants who never\
      \ saw light?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There the wicked cease from troubling,\nAnd there the weary are at rest.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ There the prisoners rest together;\nThey do not hear the voice of the\
      \ oppressor.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The small and great are there,\nAnd the servant is free from his master.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Why is light given to him who is in misery,\nAnd life to the bitter of\
      \ soul,\n"
    21: "²¹ Who long for death, but it does not come,\nAnd search for it more than\
      \ hidden treasures;\n"
    22: "²² Who rejoice exceedingly,\nAnd are glad when they can find the grave?\n"
    23: "²³ Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,\nAnd whom God has hedged\
      \ in?\n"
    24: "²⁴ For my sighing comes before I eat,\nAnd my groanings pour out like water.\n"
    25: "²⁵ For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me,\nAnd what I dreaded has\
      \ happened to me.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;\nI have no rest, for trouble comes.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: \n"
    2: "² “If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary?\nBut who can withhold\
      \ himself from speaking?\n"
    3: "³ Surely you have instructed many,\nAnd you have strengthened weak hands.\n"
    4: "⁴ Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,\nAnd you have strengthened\
      \ the feeble knees;\n"
    5: "⁵ But now it comes upon you, and you are weary;\nIt touches you, and you are\
      \ troubled.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is not your reverence your confidence?\nAnd the integrity of your ways your\
      \ hope? \n"
    7: "⁷ “Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?\nOr where were the upright\
      \ ever cut off?\n"
    8: "⁸ Even as I have seen,\nThose who plow iniquity\nAnd sow trouble reap the\
      \ same.\n"
    9: "⁹ By the blast of God they perish,\nAnd by the breath of His anger they are\
      \ consumed.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The roaring of the lion,\nThe voice of the fierce lion,\nAnd the teeth\
      \ of the young lions are broken.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The old lion perishes for lack of prey,\nAnd the cubs of the lioness are\
      \ scattered. \n"
    12: "¹² “Now a word was secretly brought to me,\nAnd my ear received a whisper\
      \ of it.\n"
    13: "¹³ In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,\nWhen deep sleep\
      \ falls on men,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Fear came upon me, and trembling,\nWhich made all my bones shake.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then a spirit passed before my face;\nThe hair on my body stood up.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ It stood still,\nBut I could not discern its appearance.\nA form was before\
      \ my eyes;\nThere was silence;\nThen I heard a voice saying:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God?\nCan a man be more pure than\
      \ his Maker?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ If He puts no trust in His servants,\nIf He charges His angels with error,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,\nWhose foundation is\
      \ in the dust,\nWho are crushed before a moth?\n"
    20: "²⁰ They are broken in pieces from morning till evening;\nThey perish forever,\
      \ with no one regarding.\n"
    21: "²¹ Does not their own excellence go away?\nThey die, even without wisdom.’"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Call out now;\nIs there anyone who will answer you?\nAnd to which of the\
      \ holy ones will you turn?\n"
    2: "² For wrath kills a foolish man,\nAnd envy slays a simple one.\n"
    3: "³ I have seen the foolish taking root,\nBut suddenly I cursed his dwelling\
      \ place.\n"
    4: "⁴ His sons are far from safety,\nThey are crushed in the gate,\nAnd there\
      \ is no deliverer.\n"
    5: "⁵ Because the hungry eat up his harvest,\nTaking it even from the thorns,\n\
      And a snare snatches their substance.\n"
    6: "⁶ For affliction does not come from the dust,\nNor does trouble spring from\
      \ the ground;\n"
    7: "⁷ Yet man is born to trouble,\nAs the sparks fly upward. \n"
    8: "⁸ “But as for me, I would seek God,\nAnd to God I would commit my cause—\n"
    9: "⁹ Who does great things, and unsearchable,\nMarvelous things without number.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He gives rain on the earth,\nAnd sends waters on the fields.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He sets on high those who are lowly,\nAnd those who mourn are lifted to\
      \ safety.\n"
    12: "¹² He frustrates the devices of the crafty,\nSo that their hands cannot carry\
      \ out their plans.\n"
    13: "¹³ He catches the wise in their own craftiness,\nAnd the counsel of the cunning\
      \ comes quickly upon them.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They meet with darkness in the daytime,\nAnd grope at noontime as in the\
      \ night.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But He saves the needy from the sword,\nFrom the mouth of the mighty,\n\
      And from their hand.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ So the poor have hope,\nAnd injustice shuts her mouth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects;\nTherefore do not despise\
      \ the chastening of the Almighty.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For He bruises, but He binds up;\nHe wounds, but His hands make whole.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He shall deliver you in six troubles,\nYes, in seven no evil shall touch\
      \ you.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In famine He shall redeem you from death,\nAnd in war from the power of\
      \ the sword.\n"
    21: "²¹ You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,\nAnd you shall not\
      \ be afraid of destruction when it comes.\n"
    22: "²² You shall laugh at destruction and famine,\nAnd you shall not be afraid\
      \ of the beasts of the earth.\n"
    23: "²³ For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field,\nAnd the beasts\
      \ of the field shall be at peace with you.\n"
    24: "²⁴ You shall know that your tent is in peace;\nYou shall visit your dwelling\
      \ and find nothing amiss.\n"
    25: "²⁵ You shall also know that your descendants shall be many,\nAnd your offspring\
      \ like the grass of the earth.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You shall come to the grave at a full age,\nAs a sheaf of grain ripens\
      \ in its season.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Behold, this we have searched out;\nIt is true.\nHear it, and know for\
      \ yourself.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Then Job answered and said: \n"
    2: "² “Oh, that my grief were fully weighed,\nAnd my calamity laid with it on\
      \ the scales!\n"
    3: "³ For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea—\nTherefore my words\
      \ have been rash.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;\nMy spirit drinks in their\
      \ poison;\nThe terrors of God are arrayed against me.\n"
    5: "⁵ Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass,\nOr does the ox low over its\
      \ fodder?\n"
    6: "⁶ Can flavorless food be eaten without salt?\nOr is there any taste in the\
      \ white of an egg?\n"
    7: "⁷ My soul refuses to touch them;\nThey are as loathsome food to me. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Oh, that I might have my request,\nThat God would grant me the thing that\
      \ I long for!\n"
    9: "⁹ That it would please God to crush me,\nThat He would loose His hand and\
      \ cut me off!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I would still have comfort;\nThough in anguish I would exult,\nHe\
      \ will not spare;\nFor I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “What strength do I have, that I should hope?\nAnd what is my end, that\
      \ I should prolong my life?\n"
    12: "¹² Is my strength the strength of stones?\nOr is my flesh bronze?\n"
    13: "¹³ Is my help not within me?\nAnd is success driven from me? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “To him who is afflicted, kindness should be shown by his friend,\nEven\
      \ though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook,\nLike the streams of\
      \ the brooks that pass away,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Which are dark because of the ice,\nAnd into which the snow vanishes.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ When it is warm, they cease to flow;\nWhen it is hot, they vanish from\
      \ their place.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The paths of their way turn aside,\nThey go nowhere and perish.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The caravans of Tema look,\nThe travelers of Sheba hope for them.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They are disappointed because they were confident;\nThey come there and\
      \ are confused.\n"
    21: "²¹ For now you are nothing,\nYou see terror and are afraid.\n"
    22: "²² Did I ever say, ‘Bring something to me’?\nOr, ‘Offer a bribe for me from\
      \ your wealth’?\n"
    23: "²³ Or, ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s hand’?\nOr, ‘Redeem me from the hand\
      \ of oppressors’? \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Teach me, and I will hold my tongue;\nCause me to understand wherein\
      \ I have erred.\n"
    25: "²⁵ How forceful are right words!\nBut what does your arguing prove?\n"
    26: "²⁶ Do you intend to rebuke my words,\nAnd the speeches of a desperate one,\
      \ which are as wind?\n"
    27: "²⁷ Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless,\nAnd you undermine your friend.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Now therefore, be pleased to look at me;\nFor I would never lie to your\
      \ face.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Yield now, let there be no injustice!\nYes, concede, my righteousness\
      \ still stands!\n"
    30: "³⁰ Is there injustice on my tongue?\nCannot my taste discern the unsavory?"
  7:
    1: "¹ “Is there not a time of hard service for man on earth?\nAre not his days\
      \ also like the days of a hired man?\n"
    2: "² Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade,\nAnd like a hired man who\
      \ eagerly looks for his wages,\n"
    3: "³ So I have been allotted months of futility,\nAnd wearisome nights have been\
      \ appointed to me.\n"
    4: "⁴ When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise,\nAnd the night be ended?’\n\
      For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn.\n"
    5: "⁵ My flesh is caked with worms and dust,\nMy skin is cracked and breaks out\
      \ afresh. \n"
    6: "⁶ “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,\nAnd are spent without hope.\n"
    7: "⁷ Oh, remember that my life is a breath!\nMy eye will never again see good.\n"
    8: "⁸ The eye of him who sees me will see me no more;\nWhile your eyes are upon\
      \ me, I shall no longer be.\n"
    9: "⁹ As the cloud disappears and vanishes away,\nSo he who goes down to the grave\
      \ does not come up.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He shall never return to his house,\nNor shall his place know him anymore.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;\nI will speak in the anguish\
      \ of my spirit;\nI will complain in the bitterness of my soul.\n"
    12: "¹² Am I a sea, or a sea serpent,\nThat You set a guard over me?\n"
    13: "¹³ When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,\nMy couch will ease my complaint,’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then You scare me with dreams\nAnd terrify me with visions,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So that my soul chooses strangling\nAnd death rather than my body.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I loathe my life;\nI would not live forever.\nLet me alone,\nFor my days\
      \ are but a breath. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “What is man, that You should exalt him,\nThat You should set Your heart\
      \ on him,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ That You should visit him every morning,\nAnd test him every moment?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ How long?\nWill You not look away from me,\nAnd let me alone till I swallow\
      \ my saliva?\n"
    20: "²⁰ Have I sinned?\nWhat have I done to You, O watcher of men?\nWhy have You\
      \ set me as Your target,\nSo that I am a burden to myself?\n"
    21: "²¹ Why then do You not pardon my transgression,\nAnd take away my iniquity?\n\
      For now I will lie down in the dust,\nAnd You will seek me diligently,\nBut\
      \ I will no longer be.”"
  8:
    1: "¹ Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: \n"
    2: "² “How long will you speak these things,\nAnd the words of your mouth be like\
      \ a strong wind?\n"
    3: "³ Does God subvert judgment?\nOr does the Almighty pervert justice?\n"
    4: "⁴ If your sons have sinned against Him,\nHe has cast them away for their transgression.\n"
    5: "⁵ If you would earnestly seek God\nAnd make your supplication to the Almighty,\n"
    6: "⁶ If you were pure and upright,\nSurely now He would awake for you,\nAnd prosper\
      \ your rightful dwelling place.\n"
    7: "⁷ Though your beginning was small,\nYet your latter end would increase abundantly.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “For inquire, please, of the former age,\nAnd consider the things discovered\
      \ by their fathers;\n"
    9: "⁹ For we were born yesterday, and know nothing,\nBecause our days on earth\
      \ are a shadow.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Will they not teach you and tell you,\nAnd utter words from their heart?\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?\nCan the reeds flourish without\
      \ water?\n"
    12: "¹² While it is yet green and not cut down,\nIt withers before any other plant.\n"
    13: "¹³ So are the paths of all who forget God;\nAnd the hope of the hypocrite\
      \ shall perish,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Whose confidence shall be cut off,\nAnd whose trust is a spider’s web.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He leans on his house, but it does not stand.\nHe holds it fast, but it\
      \ does not endure.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He grows green in the sun,\nAnd his branches spread out in his garden.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ His roots wrap around the rock heap,\nAnd look for a place in the stones.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ If he is destroyed from his place,\nThen it will deny him, saying, ‘I\
      \ have not seen you.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Behold, this is the joy of His way,\nAnd out of the earth others will\
      \ grow.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Behold, God will not cast away the blameless,\nNor will He uphold the\
      \ evildoers.\n"
    21: "²¹ He will yet fill your mouth with laughing,\nAnd your lips with rejoicing.\n"
    22: "²² Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,\nAnd the dwelling place\
      \ of the wicked will come to nothing.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ Then Job answered and said: \n"
    2: "² “Truly I know it is so,\nBut how can a man be righteous before God?\n"
    3: "³ If one wished to contend with Him,\nHe could not answer Him one time out\
      \ of a thousand.\n"
    4: "⁴ God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.\nWho has hardened himself against\
      \ Him and prospered?\n"

    12: "¹² There they cry out, but He does not answer,\nBecause of the pride of evil\

    1: "¹ Then Job answered the Lord and said: \n"
    2: "² “I know that You can do everything,\nAnd that no purpose of Yours can be\
      \ withheld from You.\n"
    3: "³ You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’\nTherefore\
      \ I have uttered what I did not understand,\nThings too wonderful for me, which\
      \ I did not know.\n"
    4: "⁴ Listen, please, and let me speak;\nYou said, ‘I will question you, and you\
      \ shall answer Me.’ \n"
    5: "⁵ “I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear,\nBut now my eye sees You.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I abhor myself,\nAnd repent in dust and ashes.” \n"
    7: '⁷ And so it was, after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, that the Lord
      said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is aroused against you and your two
      friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has. '
    8: "⁸ Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My\
      \ servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant\
      \ Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according\
      \ to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant\
      \ Job has.” \n"
    9: '⁹ So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite
      went and did as the Lord commanded them; for the Lord had accepted Job. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the Lord restored Job’s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed
      the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. '
    11: "¹¹ Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his\
      \ acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and\
      \ they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the Lord had\
      \ brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Now the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for
      he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen,
      and one thousand female donkeys. '
    13: '¹³ He also had seven sons and three daughters. '
    14: '¹⁴ And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah,
      and the name of the third Keren-Happuch. '
    15: "¹⁵ In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job;\
      \ and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children
      and grandchildren for four generations. '
    17: ¹⁷ So Job died, old and full of days.
