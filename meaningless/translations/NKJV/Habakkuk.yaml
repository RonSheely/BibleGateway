Habakkuk:
  1:
    1: "¹ The burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw. \n"
    2: "² O Lord, how long shall I cry,\nAnd You will not hear?\nEven cry out to You,\
      \ “Violence!”\nAnd You will not save.\n"
    3: "³ Why do You show me iniquity,\nAnd cause me to see trouble?\nFor plundering\
      \ and violence are before me;\nThere is strife, and contention arises.\n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore the law is powerless,\nAnd justice never goes forth.\nFor the\
      \ wicked surround the righteous;\nTherefore perverse judgment proceeds. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Look among the nations and watch—\nBe utterly astounded!\nFor I will work\
      \ a work in your days\nWhich you would not believe, though it were told you.\n"
    6: "⁶ For indeed I am raising up the Chaldeans,\nA bitter and hasty nation\nWhich\
      \ marches through the breadth of the earth,\nTo possess dwelling places that\
      \ are not theirs.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are terrible and dreadful;\nTheir judgment and their dignity proceed\
      \ from themselves.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their horses also are swifter than leopards,\nAnd more fierce than evening\
      \ wolves.\nTheir chargers charge ahead;\nTheir cavalry comes from afar;\nThey\
      \ fly as the eagle that hastens to eat. \n"
    9: "⁹ “They all come for violence;\nTheir faces are set like the east wind.\n\
      They gather captives like sand.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They scoff at kings,\nAnd princes are scorned by them.\nThey deride every\
      \ stronghold,\nFor they heap up earthen mounds and seize it.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then his mind changes, and he transgresses;\nHe commits offense,\nAscribing\
      \ this power to his god.” \n"
    12: "¹² Are You not from everlasting,\nO Lord my God, my Holy One?\nWe shall not\
      \ die.\nO Lord, You have appointed them for judgment;\nO Rock, You have marked\
      \ them for correction.\n"
    13: "¹³ You are of purer eyes than to behold evil,\nAnd cannot look on wickedness.\n\
      Why do You look on those who deal treacherously,\nAnd hold Your tongue when\
      \ the wicked devours\nA person more righteous than he?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Why do You make men like fish of the sea,\nLike creeping things that have\
      \ no ruler over them? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ They take up all of them with a hook,\nThey catch them in their net,\n\
      And gather them in their dragnet.\nTherefore they rejoice and are glad.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore they sacrifice to their net,\nAnd burn incense to their dragnet;\n\
      Because by them their share is sumptuous\nAnd their food plentiful.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Shall they therefore empty their net,\nAnd continue to slay nations without\
      \ pity?"
  2:
    1: "¹ I will stand my watch\nAnd set myself on the rampart,\nAnd watch to see\
      \ what He will say to me,\nAnd what I will answer when I am corrected. \n"
    2: "² Then the Lord answered me and said:\n“Write the vision\nAnd make it plain\
      \ on tablets,\nThat he may run who reads it.\n"
    3: "³ For the vision is yet for an appointed time;\nBut at the end it will speak,\
      \ and it will not lie.\nThough it tarries, wait for it;\nBecause it will surely\
      \ come,\nIt will not tarry. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Behold the proud,\nHis soul is not upright in him;\nBut the just shall\
      \ live by his faith. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Indeed, because he transgresses by wine,\nHe is a proud man,\nAnd he does\
      \ not stay at home.\nBecause he enlarges his desire as hell,\nAnd he is like\
      \ death, and cannot be satisfied,\nHe gathers to himself all nations\nAnd heaps\
      \ up for himself all peoples. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Will not all these take up a proverb against him,\nAnd a taunting riddle\
      \ against him, and say,\n‘Woe to him who increases\nWhat is not his—how long?\n\
      And to him who loads himself with many pledges’?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will not your creditors rise up suddenly?\nWill they not awaken who oppress\
      \ you?\nAnd you will become their booty.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because you have plundered many nations,\nAll the remnant of the people\
      \ shall plunder you,\nBecause of men’s blood\nAnd the violence of the land and\
      \ the city,\nAnd of all who dwell in it. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Woe to him who covets evil gain for his house,\nThat he may set his nest\
      \ on high,\nThat he may be delivered from the power of disaster!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You give shameful counsel to your house,\nCutting off many peoples,\n\
      And sin against your soul.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the stone will cry out from the wall,\nAnd the beam from the timbers\
      \ will answer it. \n"
    12: "¹² “Woe to him who builds a town with bloodshed,\nWho establishes a city\
      \ by iniquity!\n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts\nThat the peoples labor to feed\
      \ the fire,\nAnd nations weary themselves in vain?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the earth will be filled\nWith the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\n\
      As the waters cover the sea. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor,\nPressing him to your bottle,\n\
      Even to make him drunk,\nThat you may look on his nakedness!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You are filled with shame instead of glory.\nYou also—drink!\nAnd be exposed\
      \ as uncircumcised!\nThe cup of the Lord’s right hand will be turned against\
      \ you,\nAnd utter shame will be on your glory.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you,\nAnd the plunder of beasts\
      \ which made them afraid,\nBecause of men’s blood\nAnd the violence of the land\
      \ and the city,\nAnd of all who dwell in it. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “What profit is the image, that its maker should carve it,\nThe molded\
      \ image, a teacher of lies,\nThat the maker of its mold should trust in it,\n\
      To make mute idols?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Awake!’\nTo silent stone, ‘Arise! It shall\
      \ teach!’\nBehold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,\nYet in it there is\
      \ no breath at all. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “But the Lord is in His holy temple.\nLet all the earth keep silence before\
      \ Him.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, on Shigionoth. \n"
    2: "² O Lord, I have heard Your speech and was afraid;\nO Lord, revive Your work\
      \ in the midst of the years!\nIn the midst of the years make it known;\nIn wrath\
      \ remember mercy. \n"
    3: "³ God came from Teman,\nThe Holy One from Mount Paran. \nHis glory covered\
      \ the heavens,\nAnd the earth was full of His praise.\n"
    4: "⁴ His brightness was like the light;\nHe had rays flashing from His hand,\n\
      And there His power was hidden.\n"
    5: "⁵ Before Him went pestilence,\nAnd fever followed at His feet. \n"
    6: "⁶ He stood and measured the earth;\nHe looked and startled the nations.\n\
      And the everlasting mountains were scattered,\nThe perpetual hills bowed.\n\
      His ways are everlasting.\n"
    7: "⁷ I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;\nThe curtains of the land of Midian\
      \ trembled. \n"
    8: "⁸ O Lord, were You displeased with the rivers,\nWas Your anger against the\
      \ rivers,\nWas Your wrath against the sea,\nThat You rode on Your horses,\n\
      Your chariots of salvation?\n"
    9: "⁹ Your bow was made quite ready;\nOaths were sworn over Your arrows. \nYou\
      \ divided the earth with rivers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The mountains saw You and trembled;\nThe overflowing of the water passed\
      \ by.\nThe deep uttered its voice,\nAnd lifted its hands on high.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The sun and moon stood still in their habitation;\nAt the light of Your\
      \ arrows they went,\nAt the shining of Your glittering spear. \n"
    12: "¹² You marched through the land in indignation;\nYou trampled the nations\
      \ in anger.\n"
    13: "¹³ You went forth for the salvation of Your people,\nFor salvation with Your\
      \ Anointed.\nYou struck the head from the house of the wicked,\nBy laying bare\
      \ from foundation to neck. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You thrust through with his own arrows\nThe head of his villages.\nThey\
      \ came out like a whirlwind to scatter me;\nTheir rejoicing was like feasting\
      \ on the poor in secret.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You walked through the sea with Your horses,\nThrough the heap of great\
      \ waters. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When I heard, my body trembled;\nMy lips quivered at the voice;\nRottenness\
      \ entered my bones;\nAnd I trembled in myself,\nThat I might rest in the day\
      \ of trouble.\nWhen he comes up to the people,\nHe will invade them with his\
      \ troops. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Though the fig tree may not blossom,\nNor fruit be on the vines;\nThough\
      \ the labor of the olive may fail,\nAnd the fields yield no food;\nThough the\
      \ flock may be cut off from the fold,\nAnd there be no herd in the stalls—\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Yet I will rejoice in the Lord,\nI will joy in the God of my salvation.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord God is my strength;\nHe will make my feet like deer’s feet,\n\
      And He will make me walk on my high hills.\nTo the Chief Musician. With my stringed\
      \ instruments."
