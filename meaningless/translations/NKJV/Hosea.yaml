Hosea:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of\
      \ Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam\
      \ the son of Joash, king of Israel. \n"
    2: "² When the Lord began to speak by Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea:\n“Go, take\
      \ yourself a wife of harlotry\nAnd children of harlotry,\nFor the land has committed\
      \ great harlotry\nBy departing from the Lord.” \n"
    3: '³ So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and
      bore him a son. '
    4: "⁴ Then the Lord said to him:\n“Call his name Jezreel,\nFor in a little while\n\
      I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu,\nAnd bring an end\
      \ to the kingdom of the house of Israel.\n"
    5: "⁵ It shall come to pass in that day\nThat I will break the bow of Israel in\
      \ the Valley of Jezreel.” \n"
    6: "⁶ And she conceived again and bore a daughter. Then God said to him:\n“Call\
      \ her name Lo-Ruhamah,\nFor I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel,\n\
      But I will utterly take them away.\n"
    7: "⁷ Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah,\nWill save them by the Lord\
      \ their God,\nAnd will not save them by bow,\nNor by sword or battle,\nBy horses\
      \ or horsemen.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. '
    9: "⁹ Then God said:\n“Call his name Lo-Ammi,\nFor you are not My people,\nAnd\
      \ I will not be your God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Yet the number of the children of Israel\nShall be as the sand of the\
      \ sea,\nWhich cannot be measured or numbered.\nAnd it shall come to pass\nIn\
      \ the place where it was said to them,\n‘You are not My people,’\nThere it shall\
      \ be said to them,\n‘You are sons of the living God.’\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel\nShall be gathered\
      \ together,\nAnd appoint for themselves one head;\nAnd they shall come up out\
      \ of the land,\nFor great will be the day of Jezreel!"
  2:
    1: "¹ Say to your brethren, ‘My people,’\nAnd to your sisters, ‘Mercy is shown.’\
      \ \n"
    2: "² “Bring charges against your mother, bring charges;\nFor she is not My wife,\
      \ nor am I her Husband!\nLet her put away her harlotries from her sight,\nAnd\
      \ her adulteries from between her breasts;\n"
    3: "³ Lest I strip her naked\nAnd expose her, as in the day she was born,\nAnd\
      \ make her like a wilderness,\nAnd set her like a dry land,\nAnd slay her with\
      \ thirst. \n"
    4: "⁴ “I will not have mercy on her children,\nFor they are the children of harlotry.\n"
    5: "⁵ For their mother has played the harlot;\nShe who conceived them has behaved\
      \ shamefully.\nFor she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,\nWho give me my bread\
      \ and my water,\nMy wool and my linen,\nMy oil and my drink.’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore, behold,\nI will hedge up your way with thorns,\nAnd wall her\
      \ in,\nSo that she cannot find her paths.\n"
    7: "⁷ She will chase her lovers,\nBut not overtake them;\nYes, she will seek them,\
      \ but not find them.\nThen she will say,\n‘I will go and return to my first\
      \ husband,\nFor then it was better for me than now.’\n"
    8: "⁸ For she did not know\nThat I gave her grain, new wine, and oil,\nAnd multiplied\
      \ her silver and gold—\nWhich they prepared for Baal. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I will return and take away\nMy grain in its time\nAnd My new\
      \ wine in its season,\nAnd will take back My wool and My linen,\nGiven to cover\
      \ her nakedness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,\nAnd no one\
      \ shall deliver her from My hand.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will also cause all her mirth to cease,\nHer feast days,\nHer New Moons,\n\
      Her Sabbaths—\nAll her appointed feasts. \n"
    12: "¹² “And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees,\nOf which she has said,\n\
      ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me.’\nSo I will make them a forest,\n\
      And the beasts of the field shall eat them.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will punish her\nFor the days of the Baals to which she burned incense.\n\
      She decked herself with her earrings and jewelry,\nAnd went after her lovers;\n\
      But Me she forgot,” says the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Therefore, behold, I will allure her,\nWill bring her into the wilderness,\n\
      And speak comfort to her.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will give her her vineyards from there,\nAnd the Valley of Achor as\
      \ a door of hope;\nShe shall sing there,\nAs in the days of her youth,\nAs in\
      \ the day when she came up from the land of Egypt. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “And it shall be, in that day,”\nSays the Lord,\n“That you will call Me\
      \ ‘My Husband,’\nAnd no longer call Me ‘My Master,’\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will take from her mouth the names of the Baals,\nAnd they shall\
      \ be remembered by their name no more.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ In that day I will make a covenant for them\nWith the beasts of the field,\n\
      With the birds of the air,\nAnd with the creeping things of the ground.\nBow\
      \ and sword of battle I will shatter from the earth,\nTo make them lie down\
      \ safely. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I will betroth you to Me forever;\nYes, I will betroth you to Me\nIn\
      \ righteousness and justice,\nIn lovingkindness and mercy;\n"
    20: "²⁰ I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness,\nAnd you shall know the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ “It shall come to pass in that day\nThat I will answer,” says the Lord;\n\
      “I will answer the heavens,\nAnd they shall answer the earth.\n"
    22: "²² The earth shall answer\nWith grain,\nWith new wine,\nAnd with oil;\nThey\
      \ shall answer Jezreel.\n"
    23: "²³ Then I will sow her for Myself in the earth,\nAnd I will have mercy on\
      \ her who had not obtained mercy;\nThen I will say to those who were not My\
      \ people,\n‘You are My people!’\nAnd they shall say, ‘You are my God!’ ”"
  3:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by a lover\
      \ and is committing adultery, just like the love of the Lord for the children\
      \ of Israel, who look to other gods and love the raisin cakes of the pagans.”\
      \ \n"
    2: '² So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver, and one and one-half
      homers of barley. '
    3: "³ And I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days; you shall not play\
      \ the harlot, nor shall you have a man—so, too, will I be toward you.” \n"
    4: '⁴ For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king or prince,
      without sacrifice or sacred pillar, without ephod or teraphim. '
    5: ⁵ Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the Lord their God
      and David their king. They shall fear the Lord and His goodness in the latter
      days.
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear the word of the Lord,\nYou children of Israel,\nFor the Lord brings\
      \ a charge against the inhabitants of the land: \n“There is no truth or mercy\n\
      Or knowledge of God in the land.\n"
    2: "² By swearing and lying,\nKilling and stealing and committing adultery,\n\
      They break all restraint,\nWith bloodshed upon bloodshed.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the land will mourn;\nAnd everyone who dwells there will waste\
      \ away\nWith the beasts of the field\nAnd the birds of the air;\nEven the fish\
      \ of the sea will be taken away. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Now let no man contend, or rebuke another;\nFor your people are like those\
      \ who contend with the priest.\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you shall stumble in the day;\nThe prophet also shall stumble\
      \ with you in the night;\nAnd I will destroy your mother.\n"
    6: "⁶ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\nBecause you have rejected\
      \ knowledge,\nI also will reject you from being priest for Me;\nBecause you\
      \ have forgotten the law of your God,\nI also will forget your children. \n"
    7: "⁷ “The more they increased,\nThe more they sinned against Me;\nI will change\
      \ their glory into shame.\n"
    8: "⁸ They eat up the sin of My people;\nThey set their heart on their iniquity.\n"
    9: "⁹ And it shall be: like people, like priest.\nSo I will punish them for their\
      \ ways,\nAnd reward them for their deeds.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For they shall eat, but not have enough;\nThey shall commit harlotry,\
      \ but not increase;\nBecause they have ceased obeying the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Harlotry, wine, and new wine enslave the heart.\n"
    12: "¹² My people ask counsel from their wooden idols,\nAnd their staff informs\
      \ them.\nFor the spirit of harlotry has caused them to stray,\nAnd they have\
      \ played the harlot against their God.\n"
    13: "¹³ They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops,\nAnd burn incense on the hills,\n\
      Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths,\nBecause their shade is good.\nTherefore\
      \ your daughters commit harlotry,\nAnd your brides commit adultery. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry,\nNor your\
      \ brides when they commit adultery;\nFor the men themselves go apart with harlots,\n\
      And offer sacrifices with a ritual harlot.\nTherefore people who do not understand\
      \ will be trampled. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Though you, Israel, play the harlot,\nLet not Judah offend.\nDo not come\
      \ up to Gilgal,\nNor go up to Beth Aven,\nNor swear an oath, saying, ‘As the\
      \ Lord lives’— \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “For Israel is stubborn\nLike a stubborn calf;\nNow the Lord will let\
      \ them forage\nLike a lamb in open country. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Ephraim is joined to idols,\nLet him alone.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their drink is rebellion,\nThey commit harlotry continually.\nHer rulers\
      \ dearly love dishonor.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The wind has wrapped her up in its wings,\nAnd they shall be ashamed because\
      \ of their sacrifices."
  5:
    1: "¹ “Hear this, O priests!\nTake heed, O house of Israel!\nGive ear, O house\
      \ of the king!\nFor yours is the judgment,\nBecause you have been a snare to\
      \ Mizpah\nAnd a net spread on Tabor.\n"
    2: "² The revolters are deeply involved in slaughter,\nThough I rebuke them all.\n"
    3: "³ I know Ephraim,\nAnd Israel is not hidden from Me;\nFor now, O Ephraim,\
      \ you commit harlotry;\nIsrael is defiled. \n"
    4: "⁴ “They do not direct their deeds\nToward turning to their God,\nFor the spirit\
      \ of harlotry is in their midst,\nAnd they do not know the Lord.\n"
    5: "⁵ The pride of Israel testifies to his face;\nTherefore Israel and Ephraim\
      \ stumble in their iniquity;\nJudah also stumbles with them. \n"
    6: "⁶ “With their flocks and herds\nThey shall go to seek the Lord,\nBut they\
      \ will not find Him;\nHe has withdrawn Himself from them.\n"
    7: "⁷ They have dealt treacherously with the Lord,\nFor they have begotten pagan\
      \ children.\nNow a New Moon shall devour them and their heritage. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah,\nThe trumpet in Ramah!\nCry aloud at Beth\
      \ Aven,\n‘Look behind you, O Benjamin!’\n"
    9: "⁹ Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke;\nAmong the tribes of Israel\
      \ I make known what is sure. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark;\nI will pour\
      \ out My wrath on them like water.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment,\nBecause he willingly walked\
      \ by human precept.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore I will be to Ephraim like a moth,\nAnd to the house of Judah\
      \ like rottenness. \n"
    13: "¹³ “When Ephraim saw his sickness,\nAnd Judah saw his wound,\nThen Ephraim\
      \ went to Assyria\nAnd sent to King Jareb;\nYet he cannot cure you,\nNor heal\
      \ you of your wound.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,\nAnd like a young lion to the house\
      \ of Judah.\nI, even I, will tear them and go away;\nI will take them away,\
      \ and no one shall rescue.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will return again to My place\nTill they acknowledge their offense.\n\
      Then they will seek My face;\nIn their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Come, and let us return to the Lord;\nFor He has torn, but He will heal\
      \ us;\nHe has stricken, but He will bind us up.\n"
    2: "² After two days He will revive us;\nOn the third day He will raise us up,\n\
      That we may live in His sight.\n"
    3: "³ Let us know,\nLet us pursue the knowledge of the Lord.\nHis going forth\
      \ is established as the morning;\nHe will come to us like the rain,\nLike the\
      \ latter and former rain to the earth. \n"
    4: "⁴ “O Ephraim, what shall I do to you?\nO Judah, what shall I do to you?\n\
      For your faithfulness is like a morning cloud,\nAnd like the early dew it goes\
      \ away.\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,\nI have slain them by the words\
      \ of My mouth;\nAnd your judgments are like light that goes forth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For I desire mercy and not sacrifice,\nAnd the knowledge of God more than\
      \ burnt offerings. \n"
    7: "⁷ “But like men they transgressed the covenant;\nThere they dealt treacherously\
      \ with Me.\n"
    8: "⁸ Gilead is a city of evildoers\nAnd defiled with blood.\n"
    9: "⁹ As bands of robbers lie in wait for a man,\nSo the company of priests murder\
      \ on the way to Shechem;\nSurely they commit lewdness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel:\nThere is the harlotry\
      \ of Ephraim;\nIsrael is defiled.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you,\nWhen I return the captives\
      \ of My people."
  7:
    1: "¹ “When I would have healed Israel,\nThen the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered,\n\
      And the wickedness of Samaria.\nFor they have committed fraud;\nA thief comes\
      \ in;\nA band of robbers takes spoil outside.\n"
    2: "² They do not consider in their hearts\nThat I remember all their wickedness;\n\
      Now their own deeds have surrounded them;\nThey are before My face.\n"
    3: "³ They make a king glad with their wickedness,\nAnd princes with their lies.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ “They are all adulterers.\nLike an oven heated by a baker—\nHe ceases stirring\
      \ the fire after kneading the dough,\nUntil it is leavened.\n"
    5: "⁵ In the day of our king\nPrinces have made him sick, inflamed with wine;\n\
      He stretched out his hand with scoffers.\n"
    6: "⁶ They prepare their heart like an oven,\nWhile they lie in wait;\nTheir baker\
      \ sleeps all night;\nIn the morning it burns like a flaming fire.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are all hot, like an oven,\nAnd have devoured their judges;\nAll their\
      \ kings have fallen.\nNone among them calls upon Me. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples;\nEphraim is a cake unturned.\n"
    9: "⁹ Aliens have devoured his strength,\nBut he does not know it;\nYes, gray\
      \ hairs are here and there on him,\nYet he does not know it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the pride of Israel testifies to his face,\nBut they do not return\
      \ to the Lord their God,\nNor seek Him for all this. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Ephraim also is like a silly dove, without sense—\nThey call to Egypt,\n\
      They go to Assyria.\n"
    12: "¹² Wherever they go, I will spread My net on them;\nI will bring them down\
      \ like birds of the air;\nI will chastise them\nAccording to what their congregation\
      \ has heard. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Woe to them, for they have fled from Me!\nDestruction to them,\nBecause\
      \ they have transgressed against Me!\nThough I redeemed them,\nYet they have\
      \ spoken lies against Me.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They did not cry out to Me with their heart\nWhen they wailed upon their\
      \ beds. \n“They assemble together for grain and new wine,\nThey rebel against\
      \ Me;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Though I disciplined and strengthened their arms,\nYet they devise evil\
      \ against Me;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They return, but not to the Most High;\nThey are like a treacherous bow.\n\
      Their princes shall fall by the sword\nFor the cursings of their tongue.\nThis\
      \ shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
  8:
    1: "¹ “Set the trumpet to your mouth!\nHe shall come like an eagle against the\
      \ house of the Lord,\nBecause they have transgressed My covenant\nAnd rebelled\
      \ against My law.\n"
    2: "² Israel will cry to Me,\n‘My God, we know You!’\n"
    3: "³ Israel has rejected the good;\nThe enemy will pursue him. \n"
    4: "⁴ “They set up kings, but not by Me;\nThey made princes, but I did not acknowledge\
      \ them.\nFrom their silver and gold\nThey made idols for themselves—\nThat they\
      \ might be cut off.\n"
    5: "⁵ Your calf is rejected, O Samaria!\nMy anger is aroused against them—\nHow\
      \ long until they attain to innocence?\n"
    6: "⁶ For from Israel is even this:\nA workman made it, and it is not God;\nBut\
      \ the calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces. \n"
    7: "⁷ “They sow the wind,\nAnd reap the whirlwind.\nThe stalk has no bud;\nIt\
      \ shall never produce meal.\nIf it should produce,\nAliens would swallow it\
      \ up.\n"
    8: "⁸ Israel is swallowed up;\nNow they are among the Gentiles\nLike a vessel\
      \ in which is no pleasure.\n"
    9: "⁹ For they have gone up to Assyria,\nLike a wild donkey alone by itself;\n\
      Ephraim has hired lovers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yes, though they have hired among the nations,\nNow I will gather them;\n\
      And they shall sorrow a little,\nBecause of the burden of the king of princes.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Because Ephraim has made many altars for sin,\nThey have become for him\
      \ altars for sinning.\n"
    12: "¹² I have written for him the great things of My law,\nBut they were considered\
      \ a strange thing.\n"
    13: "¹³ For the sacrifices of My offerings they sacrifice flesh and eat it,\n\
      But the Lord does not accept them.\nNow He will remember their iniquity and\
      \ punish their sins.\nThey shall return to Egypt. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “For Israel has forgotten his Maker,\nAnd has built temples;\nJudah also\
      \ has multiplied fortified cities;\nBut I will send fire upon his cities,\n\
      And it shall devour his palaces.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ Do not rejoice, O Israel, with joy like other peoples,\nFor you have played\
      \ the harlot against your God.\nYou have made love for hire on every threshing\
      \ floor.\n"
    2: "² The threshing floor and the winepress\nShall not feed them,\nAnd the new\
      \ wine shall fail in her. \n"
    3: "³ They shall not dwell in the Lord’s land,\nBut Ephraim shall return to Egypt,\n\
      And shall eat unclean things in Assyria.\n"
    4: "⁴ They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord,\nNor shall their sacrifices\
      \ be pleasing to Him.\nIt shall be like bread of mourners to them;\nAll who\
      \ eat it shall be defiled.\nFor their bread shall be for their own life;\nIt\
      \ shall not come into the house of the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ What will you do in the appointed day,\nAnd in the day of the feast of the\
      \ Lord?\n"
    6: "⁶ For indeed they are gone because of destruction.\nEgypt shall gather them\
      \ up;\nMemphis shall bury them.\nNettles shall possess their valuables of silver;\n\
      Thorns shall be in their tents. \n"
    7: "⁷ The days of punishment have come;\nThe days of recompense have come.\nIsrael\
      \ knows!\nThe prophet is a fool,\nThe spiritual man is insane,\nBecause of the\
      \ greatness of your iniquity and great enmity.\n"
    8: "⁸ The watchman of Ephraim is with my God;\nBut the prophet is a fowler’s snare\
      \ in all his ways—\nEnmity in the house of his God.\n"
    9: "⁹ They are deeply corrupted,\nAs in the days of Gibeah.\nHe will remember\
      \ their iniquity;\nHe will punish their sins. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “I found Israel\nLike grapes in the wilderness;\nI saw your fathers\n\
      As the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season.\nBut they went to Baal\
      \ Peor,\nAnd separated themselves to that shame;\nThey became an abomination\
      \ like the thing they loved.\n"
    11: "¹¹ As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird—\nNo birth, no\
      \ pregnancy, and no conception!\n"
    12: "¹² Though they bring up their children,\nYet I will bereave them to the last\
      \ man.\nYes, woe to them when I depart from them!\n"
    13: "¹³ Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place,\nSo Ephraim\
      \ will bring out his children to the murderer.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Give them, O Lord—\nWhat will You give?\nGive them a miscarrying womb\n\
      And dry breasts! \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “All their wickedness is in Gilgal,\nFor there I hated them.\nBecause\
      \ of the evil of their deeds\nI will drive them from My house;\nI will love\
      \ them no more.\nAll their princes are rebellious.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Ephraim is stricken,\nTheir root is dried up;\nThey shall bear no fruit.\n\
      Yes, were they to bear children,\nI would kill the darlings of their womb.”\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ My God will cast them away,\nBecause they did not obey Him;\nAnd they\
      \ shall be wanderers among the nations."
  10:
    1: "¹ Israel empties his vine;\nHe brings forth fruit for himself.\nAccording\
      \ to the multitude of his fruit\nHe has increased the altars;\nAccording to\
      \ the bounty of his land\nThey have embellished his sacred pillars.\n"
    2: "² Their heart is divided;\nNow they are held guilty.\nHe will break down their\
      \ altars;\nHe will ruin their sacred pillars. \n"
    3: "³ For now they say,\n“We have no king,\nBecause we did not fear the Lord.\n\
      And as for a king, what would he do for us?”\n"
    4: "⁴ They have spoken words,\nSwearing falsely in making a covenant.\nThus judgment\
      \ springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field. \n"
    5: "⁵ The inhabitants of Samaria fear\nBecause of the calf of Beth Aven.\nFor\
      \ its people mourn for it,\nAnd its priests shriek for it—\nBecause its glory\
      \ has departed from it.\n"
    6: "⁶ The idol also shall be carried to Assyria\nAs a present for King Jareb.\n\
      Ephraim shall receive shame,\nAnd Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.\
