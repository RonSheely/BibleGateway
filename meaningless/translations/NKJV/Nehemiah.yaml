Nehemiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.\nIt came to pass in the month\
      \ of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel, "
    2: '² that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them
      concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning
      Jerusalem. '
    3: "³ And they said to me, “The survivors who are left from the captivity in the\
      \ province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is\
      \ also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.” \n"
    4: "⁴ So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned\
      \ for many days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven. \n"
    5: '⁵ And I said: “I pray, Lord God of heaven, O great and awesome God, You who
      keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments, '
    6: '⁶ please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the
      prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children
      of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which
      we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned. '
    7: '⁷ We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments,
      the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. '
    8: '⁸ Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying,
      ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations; '
    9: '⁹ but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some
      of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, yet I will gather
      them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling
      for My name.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by
      Your great power, and by Your strong hand. '
    11: "¹¹ O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your\
      \ servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name;\
      \ and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the\
      \ sight of this man.”\nFor I was the king’s cupbearer."
  2:
    1: '¹ And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King
      Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the
      king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before. '
    2: "² Therefore the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not\
      \ sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.”\nSo I became dreadfully afraid, "
    3: "³ and said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not\
      \ be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its\
      \ gates are burned with fire?” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the king said to me, “What do you request?”\nSo I prayed to the God\
      \ of heaven. "
    5: "⁵ And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has\
      \ found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of\
      \ my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long\
      \ will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to\
      \ send me; and I set him a time. \n"
    7: '⁷ Furthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be
      given to me for the governors of the region beyond the River, that they must
      permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, '
    8: "⁸ and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he must give\
      \ me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which pertains to the\
      \ temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” And the\
      \ king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then I went to the governors in the region beyond the River, and gave them
      the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen
      with me. '
    10: "¹⁰ When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of\
      \ it, they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being\
      \ of the children of Israel. \n"
    11: '¹¹ So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. '
    12: '¹² Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what
      my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with
      me, except the one on which I rode. '
    13: '¹³ And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and
      the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and
      its gates which were burned with fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there
      was no room for the animal under me to pass. '
    15: '¹⁵ So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned
      back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. '
    16: "¹⁶ And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I\
      \ had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the\
      \ others who did the work. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem
      lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall
      of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.” '
    18: "¹⁸ And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and\
      \ also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me.\nSo they said, “Let us\
      \ rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to this good work. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem\
      \ the Arab heard of it, they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What\
      \ is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?” \n"
    20: ²⁰ So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper
      us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage
      or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”
  3:
    1: '¹ Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and
      built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They built as
      far as the Tower of the Hundred, and consecrated it, then as far as the Tower
      of Hananel. '
    2: "² Next to Eliashib the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son\
      \ of Imri built. \n"
    3: '³ Also the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and
      hung its doors with its bolts and bars. '
    4: '⁴ And next to them Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, made repairs.
      Next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs.
      Next to them Zadok the son of Baana made repairs. '
    5: "⁵ Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles did not put their\
      \ shoulders to the work of their Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ Moreover Jehoiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired
      the Old Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors, with its bolts and bars. '
    7: '⁷ And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, the men
      of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor of the region beyond
      the River. '
    8: '⁸ Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs.
      Also next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs; and they fortified
      Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. '
    9: '⁹ And next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, leader of half the district of
      Jerusalem, made repairs. '
    10: "¹⁰ Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs in front of his\
      \ house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabniah made repairs. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Malchijah the son of Harim and Hashub the son of Pahath-Moab repaired
      another section, as well as the Tower of the Ovens. '
    12: "¹² And next to him was Shallum the son of Hallohesh, leader of half the district\
      \ of Jerusalem; he and his daughters made repairs. \n"
    13: "¹³ Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built\
      \ it, hung its doors with its bolts and bars, and repaired a thousand cubits\
      \ of the wall as far as the Refuse Gate. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Malchijah the son of Rechab, leader of the district of Beth Haccerem,\
      \ repaired the Refuse Gate; he built it and hung its doors with its bolts and\
      \ bars. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Shallun the son of Col-Hozeh, leader of the district of Mizpah, repaired
      the Fountain Gate; he built it, covered it, hung its doors with its bolts and
      bars, and repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah by the King’s Garden, as far
      as the stairs that go down from the City of David. '
    16: "¹⁶ After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, leader of half the district of Beth\
      \ Zur, made repairs as far as the place in front of the tombs of David, to the\
      \ man-made pool, and as far as the House of the Mighty. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ After him the Levites, under Rehum the son of Bani, made repairs. Next
      to him Hashabiah, leader of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his
      district. '
    18: '¹⁸ After him their brethren, under Bavai the son of Henadad, leader of the
      other half of the district of Keilah, made repairs. '
    19: '¹⁹ And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the leader of Mizpah, repaired
      another section in front of the Ascent to the Armory at the buttress. '
    20: '²⁰ After him Baruch the son of Zabbai carefully repaired the other section,
      from the buttress to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. '
    21: "²¹ After him Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, repaired another\
      \ section, from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of\
      \ Eliashib. \n"
    22: '²² And after him the priests, the men of the plain, made repairs. '
    23: '²³ After him Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. After
      them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs by his house. '
    24: '²⁴ After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the
      house of Azariah to the buttress, even as far as the corner. '
    25: "²⁵ Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the buttress, and on the tower\
      \ which projects from the king’s upper house that was by the court of the prison.\
      \ After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Moreover the Nethinim who dwelt in Ophel made repairs as far as the place
      in front of the Water Gate toward the east, and on the projecting tower. '
    27: "²⁷ After them the Tekoites repaired another section, next to the great projecting\
      \ tower, and as far as the wall of Ophel. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Beyond the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each in front of his own
      house. '
    29: '²⁹ After them Zadok the son of Immer made repairs in front of his own house.
      After him Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made
      repairs. '
    30: '³⁰ After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph,
      repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah made repairs
      in front of his dwelling. '
    31: '³¹ After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the
      house of the Nethinim and of the merchants, in front of the Miphkad Gate, and
      as far as the upper room at the corner. '
    32: ³² And between the upper room at the corner, as far as the Sheep Gate, the
      goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.
  4:
    1: '¹ But it so happened, when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall,
      that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews. '
    2: "² And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, “What\
      \ are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer\
      \ sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from\
      \ the heaps of rubbish—stones that are burned?” \n"
    3: "³ Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Whatever they build,\
      \ if even a fox goes up on it, he will break down their stone wall.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads,
      and give them as plunder to a land of captivity! '
    5: "⁵ Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from\
      \ before You; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders. \n"
    6: "⁶ So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half\
      \ its height, for the people had a mind to work. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the
      Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps
      were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry, '
    8: '⁸ and all of them conspired together to come and attack Jerusalem and create
      confusion. '
    9: "⁹ Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a\
      \ watch against them day and night. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and there is\
      \ so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ And our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see anything, till\
      \ we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.” \n"
    12: "¹² So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten\
      \ times, “From whatever place you turn, they will be upon us.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore I positioned men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the
      openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords,
      their spears, and their bows. '
    14: "¹⁴ And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to\
      \ the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great\
      \ and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your\
      \ wives, and your houses.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that
      God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall,
      everyone to his work. '
    16: '¹⁶ So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants worked at construction,
      while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor;
      and the leaders were behind all the house of Judah. '
    17: '¹⁷ Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves
      so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a
      weapon. '
    18: "¹⁸ Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built.\
      \ And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “The
      work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the
      wall. '
    20: "²⁰ Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God\
      \ will fight for us.” \n"
    21: '²¹ So we labored in the work, and half of the men held the spears from daybreak
      until the stars appeared. '
    22: '²² At the same time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant
      stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working
      party by day.” '
    23: ²³ So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed
      me took off our clothes, except that everyone took them off for washing.
  5:
    1: '¹ And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their
      Jewish brethren. '
    2: "² For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters are many;\
      \ therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.” \n"
    3: "³ There were also some who said, “We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards\
      \ and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.” \n"
    4: '⁴ There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax
      on our lands and vineyards. '
    5: "⁵ Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their\
      \ children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves,\
      \ and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It is not in our\
      \ power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. '
    7: '⁷ After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them,
      “Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.” So I called a great assembly
      against them. '
    8: "⁸ And I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish\
      \ brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your\
      \ brethren? Or should they be sold to us?”\nThen they were silenced and found\
      \ nothing to say. "
    9: '⁹ Then I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the
      fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? '
    10: '¹⁰ I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain.
      Please, let us stop this usury! '
    11: "¹¹ Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their\
      \ olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain,\
      \ the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.” \n"
    12: "¹² So they said, “We will restore it, and will require nothing from them;\
      \ we will do as you say.”\nThen I called the priests, and required an oath from\
      \ them that they would do according to this promise. "
    13: "¹³ Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out\
      \ each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this\
      \ promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.”\nAnd all the assembly\
      \ said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. Then the people did according to this\
      \ promise. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the
      land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King
      Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s provisions. '
    15: '¹⁵ But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people,
      and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even
      their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the
      fear of God. '
    16: "¹⁶ Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any\
      \ land. All my servants were gathered there for the work. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ And at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those
      who came to us from the nations around us. '
    18: "¹⁸ Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also\
      \ fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds\
      \ of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor’s provisions,\
      \ because the bondage was heavy on this people. \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Remember me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this
      people.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of
      our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks
      left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates), '
    2: "² that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together\
      \ among the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they thought to do me harm. \n"
    3: "³ So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that\
      \ I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down\
      \ to you?” \n"
    4: "⁴ But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same\
      \ manner. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an
      open letter in his hand. '
    6: "⁶ In it was written:\nIt is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that\
      \ you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you\
      \ are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king. "
    7: "⁷ And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem,\
      \ saying, “There is a king in Judah!” Now these matters will be reported to\
      \ the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but\
      \ you invent them in your own heart.” \n"
    9: "⁹ For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be\
      \ weakened in the work, and it will not be done.”\nNow therefore, O God, strengthen\
      \ my hands. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son\
      \ of Mehetabel, who was a secret informer; and he said, “Let us meet together\
      \ in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the\
      \ temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to\
      \ kill you.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who
      would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!” '
    12: '¹² Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced
      this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. '
    13: "¹³ For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and act that way\
      \ and sin, so that they might have cause for an evil report, that they might\
      \ reproach me. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works,\
      \ and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made\
      \ me afraid. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two
      days. '
    16: "¹⁶ And it happened, when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations\
      \ around us saw these things, that they were very disheartened in their own\
      \ eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and
      the letters of Tobiah came to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of
      Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of
      Meshullam the son of Berechiah. '
    19: ¹⁹ Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him.
      Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
  7:
    1: '¹ Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the
      gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, '
    2: "² that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the\
      \ leader of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than\
      \ many. \n"
    3: "³ And I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the\
      \ sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and\
      \ appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station\
      \ and another in front of his own house.” \n"

      Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. '
    5: '⁵ And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing

    6: "⁶ And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.\nThen all the people answered,\
      \ “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and\

      to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place. '
    8: "⁸ So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave\

    9: "⁹ And Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the\

    10: "¹⁰ Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and\

    11: '¹¹ So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day

    12: "¹² And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and\

    13: '¹³ Now on the second day the heads of the fathers’ houses of all the people,
      with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to
      understand the words of the Law. '
    14: '¹⁴ And they found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded by Moses,
      that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh
      month, '
    15: "¹⁵ and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in\
      \ Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and bring olive branches, branches\
      \ of oil trees, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of leafy trees,\
      \ to make booths, as it is written.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths,
      each one on the roof of his house, or in their courtyards or the courts of the
      house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square
      of the Gate of Ephraim. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made
      booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun
      until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great
      gladness. '
    18: ¹⁸ Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the
      Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth
      day there was a sacred assembly, according to the prescribed manner.
  9:
    1: '¹ Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled
      with fasting, in sackcloth, and with dust on their heads. '
    2: '² Then those of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners;
      and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. '
    3: "³ And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the\
      \ Lord their God for one-fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed\
      \ and worshiped the Lord their God. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani
      stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the Lord
      their God. '
    5: "⁵ And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah,\
      \ Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said:\n“Stand up and bless the Lord your God\nForever\

    6: "⁶ You alone are the Lord;\nYou have made heaven,\nThe heaven of heavens, with\

    9: "⁹ “You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,\nAnd heard their cry by\

    10: "¹⁰ You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,\nAgainst all his servants,\n\
      And against all the people of his land.\nFor You knew that they acted proudly\
      \ against them.\nSo You made a name for Yourself, as it is this day.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And You divided the sea before them,\nSo that they went through the midst\
      \ of the sea on the dry land;\nAnd their persecutors You threw into the deep,\n\
      As a stone into the mighty waters.\n"
    12: "¹² Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar,\nAnd by night with\
      \ a pillar of fire,\nTo give them light on the road\nWhich they should travel.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ “You came down also on Mount Sinai,\nAnd spoke with them from heaven,\n\
      And gave them just ordinances and true laws,\nGood statutes and commandments.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You made known to them Your holy Sabbath,\nAnd commanded them precepts,\
      \ statutes and laws,\nBy the hand of Moses Your servant.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger,\nAnd brought them water\
      \ out of the rock for their thirst,\nAnd told them to go in to possess the land\n\
      Which You had sworn to give them. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “But they and our fathers acted proudly,\nHardened their necks,\nAnd did\
      \ not heed Your commandments.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They refused to obey,\nAnd they were not mindful of Your wonders\nThat\
      \ You did among them.\nBut they hardened their necks,\nAnd in their rebellion\n\
      They appointed a leader\nTo return to their bondage.\nBut You are God,\nReady\
      \ to pardon,\nGracious and merciful,\nSlow to anger,\nAbundant in kindness,\n\
      And did not forsake them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Even when they made a molded calf for themselves,\nAnd said, ‘This is\
      \ your god\nThat brought you up out of Egypt,’\nAnd worked great provocations,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Yet in Your manifold mercies\nYou did not forsake them in the wilderness.\n\
      The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day,\nTo lead them on the\
      \ road;\nNor the pillar of fire by night,\nTo show them light,\nAnd the way\
      \ they should go.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,\nAnd did not withhold\
      \ Your manna from their mouth,\nAnd gave them water for their thirst.\n"
    21: "²¹ Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness;\nThey lacked nothing;\n\
      Their clothes did not wear out\nAnd their feet did not swell. \n"
    22: "²² “Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations,\nAnd divided them into districts.\n\
      So they took possession of the land of Sihon,\nThe land of the king of Heshbon,\n\
      And the land of Og king of Bashan.\n"
    23: "²³ You also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven,\nAnd brought\
      \ them into the land\nWhich You had told their fathers\nTo go in and possess.\n"
    24: "²⁴ So the people went in\nAnd possessed the land;\nYou subdued before them\
      \ the inhabitants of the land,\nThe Canaanites,\nAnd gave them into their hands,\n\
      With their kings\nAnd the people of the land,\nThat they might do with them\
      \ as they wished.\n"
    25: "²⁵ And they took strong cities and a rich land,\nAnd possessed houses full\

      \ in abundance.\nSo they ate and were filled and grew fat,\nAnd delighted themselves\
      \ in Your great goodness. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “Nevertheless they were disobedient\nAnd rebelled against You,\nCast Your\
      \ law behind their backs\nAnd killed Your prophets, who testified against them\n\
      To turn them to Yourself;\nAnd they worked great provocations.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies,\nWho oppressed\
      \ them;\nAnd in the time of their trouble,\nWhen they cried to You,\nYou heard\

    28: "²⁸ “But after they had rest,\nThey again did evil before You.\nTherefore\
      \ You left them in the hand of their enemies,\nSo that they had dominion over\

      And many times You delivered them according to Your mercies,\n"
    29: "²⁹ And testified against them,\nThat You might bring them back to Your law.\n\
      Yet they acted proudly,\nAnd did not heed Your commandments,\nBut sinned against\
      \ Your judgments,\n‘Which if a man does, he shall live by them.’\nAnd they shrugged\
      \ their shoulders,\nStiffened their necks,\nAnd would not hear.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Yet for many years You had patience with them,\nAnd testified against\
      \ them by Your Spirit in Your prophets.\nYet they would not listen;\nTherefore\

      house of our God. '
    34: "³⁴ We cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for bringing\
      \ the wood offering into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses,\
      \ at the appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of the Lord our\

    35: '³⁵ And we made ordinances to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the
      firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the house of the Lord; '

      kinds of trees, the new wine and oil, to the priests, to the storerooms of the
      house of our God; and to bring the tithes of our land to the Levites, for the
      Levites should receive the tithes in all our farming communities. '
    38: "³⁸ And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when\
      \ the Levites receive tithes; and the Levites shall bring up a tenth of the\
      \ tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms of the storehouse. \n"
    39: ³⁹ For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering
      of the grain, of the new wine and the oil, to the storerooms where the articles
      of the sanctuary are, where the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and
      the singers are; and we will not neglect the house of our God.

    1: '¹ Now the leaders of the people dwelt at Jerusalem; the rest of the people
      cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and
      nine-tenths were to dwell in other cities. '

      \ at Jerusalem. \n"
    3: '³ These are the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (But in the

    36: ³⁶ Some of the Judean divisions of Levites were in Benjamin.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the
      son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, '
    2: '² Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, '
    3: '³ Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, '

    8: '⁸ Moreover the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and
      Mattaniah who led the thanksgiving psalms, he and his brethren. '
    9: "⁹ Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, stood across from them in their\
      \ duties. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Jeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot Eliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada, '
    11: "¹¹ Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua. \n"
    12: '¹² Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of the fathers’ houses
      were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; '
    13: '¹³ of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; '

    20: '²⁰ of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; '
    21: "²¹ of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel. \n"
    22: '²² During the reign of Darius the Persian, a record was also kept of the
      Levites and priests who had been heads of their fathers’ houses in the days
      of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua. '
    23: "²³ The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers’ houses until the days of Johanan\
      \ the son of Eliashib, were written in the book of the chronicles. \n"
    24: '²⁴ And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the
      son of Kadmiel, with their brothers across from them, to praise and give thanks,
      group alternating with group, according to the command of David the man of God. '
    25: '²⁵ Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers
      keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates. '
    26: "²⁶ These lived in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak,\
      \ and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.\
      \ \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites
      in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication
      with gladness, both with thanksgivings and singing, with cymbals and stringed
      instruments and harps. '
    28: '²⁸ And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around
      Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, '
    29: '²⁹ from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for
      the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem. '
    30: "³⁰ Then the priests and Levites purified themselves, and purified the people,\
      \ the gates, and the wall. \n"
    31: '³¹ So I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two large
      thanksgiving choirs. One went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse
      Gate. '
    32: '³² After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah, '
    33: '³³ and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, '
    34: '³⁴ Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, '
    35: '³⁵ and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets—Zechariah the son of Jonathan,
      the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur,
      the son of Asaph, '
    36: '³⁶ and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel,
      Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And
      Ezra the scribe went before them. '
    37: "³⁷ By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up the stairs of the\
      \ City of David, on the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of David, as\
      \ far as the Water Gate eastward. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way, and I was behind them
      with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far
      as the Broad Wall, '
    39: "³⁹ and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate,\
      \ the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate;\
      \ and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and
      the half of the rulers with me; '
    41: '⁴¹ and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
      and Hananiah, with trumpets; '
    42: "⁴² also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and\
      \ Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director. \n"
    43: "⁴³ Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had\
      \ made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced,\
      \ so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse
      for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from
      the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and
      Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and
      the charge of the purification, according to the command of David and Solomon
      his son. '
    46: '⁴⁶ For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers,
      and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. '
    47: ⁴⁷ In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the
      portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also
      consecrated holy things for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated them for
      the children of Aaron.
  13:
    1: '¹ On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people,
      and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into
      the assembly of God, '
    2: '² because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but
      hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into
      a blessing. '
    3: "³ So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed\
      \ multitude from Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms
      of the house of our God, was allied with Tobiah. '
    5: '⁵ And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored
      the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the
      new wine and oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers
      and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests. '
    6: '⁶ But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year
      of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain
      days I obtained leave from the king, '
    7: '⁷ and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for
      Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God. '
    8: '⁸ And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of
      Tobiah out of the room. '
    9: "⁹ Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them\
      \ the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given them;
      for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his
      field. '
    11: '¹¹ So I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?”
      And I gathered them together and set them in their place. '
    12: '¹² Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the
      oil to the storehouse. '
    13: "¹³ And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest\
      \ and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan\
      \ the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful,\
      \ and their task was to distribute to their brethren. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds\
      \ that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services! \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath,
      and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all
      kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And
      I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions. '
    16: "¹⁶ Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods,\
      \ and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil
      thing is this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day? '
    18: "¹⁸ Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster\
      \ on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the\
      \ Sabbath.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the
      Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not
      be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted some of my servants at the gates,
      so that no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day. '
    20: "²⁰ Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem\
      \ once or twice. \n"
    21: '²¹ Then I warned them, and said to them, “Why do you spend the night around
      the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you!” From that time on they
      came no more on the Sabbath. '
    22: "²² And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that\
      \ they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day.\nRemember\
      \ me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness\
      \ of Your mercy! \n"
    23: '²³ In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon,
      and Moab. '
    24: "²⁴ And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not\
      \ speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or\
      \ the other people. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled
      out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your
      daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or
      yourselves. '
    26: '²⁶ Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations
      there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king
      over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin. '
    27: "²⁷ Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against\
      \ our God by marrying pagan women?” \n"
    28: "²⁸ And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was\
      \ a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and\
      \ the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also assigned duties to the
      priests and the Levites, each to his service, '
    31: "³¹ and to bringing the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times.\n\
      Remember me, O my God, for good!"
