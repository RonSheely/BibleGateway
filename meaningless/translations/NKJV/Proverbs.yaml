  1:
    1: "¹ The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: \n"
    2: "² To know wisdom and instruction,\nTo perceive the words of understanding,\n"
    3: "³ To receive the instruction of wisdom,\nJustice, judgment, and equity;\n"
    4: "⁴ To give prudence to the simple,\nTo the young man knowledge and discretion—\n"
    5: "⁵ A wise man will hear and increase learning,\nAnd a man of understanding\
      \ will attain wise counsel,\n"
    6: "⁶ To understand a proverb and an enigma,\nThe words of the wise and their\
      \ riddles. \n"
    7: "⁷ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,\nBut fools despise wisdom\
      \ and instruction. \n"
    8: "⁸ My son, hear the instruction of your father,\nAnd do not forsake the law\
      \ of your mother;\n"
    9: "⁹ For they will be a graceful ornament on your head,\nAnd chains about your\
      \ neck. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ My son, if sinners entice you,\nDo not consent.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If they say, “Come with us,\nLet us lie in wait to shed blood;\nLet us\
      \ lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;\n"
    12: "¹² Let us swallow them alive like Sheol,\nAnd whole, like those who go down\
      \ to the Pit;\n"
    13: "¹³ We shall find all kinds of precious possessions,\nWe shall fill our houses\
      \ with spoil;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Cast in your lot among us,\nLet us all have one purse”—\n"
    15: "¹⁵ My son, do not walk in the way with them,\nKeep your foot from their path;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For their feet run to evil,\nAnd they make haste to shed blood.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Surely, in vain the net is spread\nIn the sight of any bird;\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But they lie in wait for their own blood,\nThey lurk secretly for their\
      \ own lives.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain;\nIt takes away the\
      \ life of its owners. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Wisdom calls aloud outside;\nShe raises her voice in the open squares.\n"
    21: "²¹ She cries out in the chief concourses,\nAt the openings of the gates in\
      \ the city\nShe speaks her words:\n"
    22: "²² “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?\nFor scorners delight\
      \ in their scorning,\nAnd fools hate knowledge.\n"
    23: "²³ Turn at my rebuke;\nSurely I will pour out my spirit on you;\nI will make\
      \ my words known to you.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Because I have called and you refused,\nI have stretched out my hand and\
      \ no one regarded,\n"
    25: "²⁵ Because you disdained all my counsel,\nAnd would have none of my rebuke,\n"
    26: "²⁶ I also will laugh at your calamity;\nI will mock when your terror comes,\n"
    27: "²⁷ When your terror comes like a storm,\nAnd your destruction comes like\
      \ a whirlwind,\nWhen distress and anguish come upon you. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;\nThey will seek me\
      \ diligently, but they will not find me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because they hated knowledge\nAnd did not choose the fear of the Lord,\n"
    30: "³⁰ They would have none of my counsel\nAnd despised my every rebuke.\n"
    31: "³¹ Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way,\nAnd be filled to\
      \ the full with their own fancies.\n"
    32: "³² For the turning away of the simple will slay them,\nAnd the complacency\
      \ of fools will destroy them;\n"
    33: "³³ But whoever listens to me will dwell safely,\nAnd will be secure, without\
      \ fear of evil.”"
  2:
    1: "¹ My son, if you receive my words,\nAnd treasure my commands within you,\n"
    2: "² So that you incline your ear to wisdom,\nAnd apply your heart to understanding;\n"
    3: "³ Yes, if you cry out for discernment,\nAnd lift up your voice for understanding,\n"
    4: "⁴ If you seek her as silver,\nAnd search for her as for hidden treasures;\n"
    5: "⁵ Then you will understand the fear of the Lord,\nAnd find the knowledge of\
      \ God.\n"
    6: "⁶ For the Lord gives wisdom;\nFrom His mouth come knowledge and understanding;\n"

      \ walk uprightly;\n"
    8: "⁸ He guards the paths of justice,\nAnd preserves the way of His saints.\n"
    9: "⁹ Then you will understand righteousness and justice,\nEquity and every good\
      \ path. \n"

    11: "¹¹ Discretion will preserve you;\nUnderstanding will keep you,\n"

      \ things,\n"
    13: "¹³ From those who leave the paths of uprightness\nTo walk in the ways of\
      \ darkness;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who rejoice in doing evil,\nAnd delight in the perversity of the wicked;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Whose ways are crooked,\nAnd who are devious in their paths;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ To deliver you from the immoral woman,\nFrom the seductress who flatters\
      \ with her words,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Who forsakes the companion of her youth,\nAnd forgets the covenant of\
      \ her God.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For her house leads down to death,\nAnd her paths to the dead;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ None who go to her return,\nNor do they regain the paths of life—\n"
    20: "²⁰ So you may walk in the way of goodness,\nAnd keep to the paths of righteousness.\n"
    21: "²¹ For the upright will dwell in the land,\nAnd the blameless will remain\
      \ in it;\n"
    22: "²² But the wicked will be cut off from the earth,\nAnd the unfaithful will\
      \ be uprooted from it."
  3:
    1: "¹ My son, do not forget my law,\nBut let your heart keep my commands;\n"
    2: "² For length of days and long life\nAnd peace they will add to you. \n"
    3: "³ Let not mercy and truth forsake you;\nBind them around your neck,\nWrite\
      \ them on the tablet of your heart,\n"
    4: "⁴ And so find favor and high esteem\nIn the sight of God and man. \n"

      \ increase;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ So your barns will be filled with plenty,\nAnd your vats will overflow\
      \ with new wine. \n"
    11: "¹¹ My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,\nNor detest His correction;\n"
    12: "¹² For whom the Lord loves He corrects,\nJust as a father the son in whom\
      \ he delights. \n"
    13: "¹³ Happy is the man who finds wisdom,\nAnd the man who gains understanding;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For her proceeds are better than the profits of silver,\nAnd her gain\
      \ than fine gold.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ She is more precious than rubies,\nAnd all the things you may desire cannot\
      \ compare with her.\n"

    21: "²¹ My son, let them not depart from your eyes—\nKeep sound wisdom and discretion;\n"
    22: "²² So they will be life to your soul\nAnd grace to your neck.\n"
    23: "²³ Then you will walk safely in your way,\nAnd your foot will not stumble.\n"

      \ your sleep will be sweet.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not be afraid of sudden terror,\nNor of trouble from the wicked when\
      \ it comes;\n"
    26: "²⁶ For the Lord will be your confidence,\nAnd will keep your foot from being\
      \ caught. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,\nWhen it is in the\
      \ power of your hand to do so.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Do not say to your neighbor,\n“Go, and come back,\nAnd tomorrow I will\
      \ give it,”\nWhen you have it with you.\n"

    30: "³⁰ Do not strive with a man without cause,\nIf he has done you no harm. \n"
    31: "³¹ Do not envy the oppressor,\nAnd choose none of his ways;\n"

      \ counsel is with the upright.\n"
    33: "³³ The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked,\nBut He blesses the\
      \ home of the just.\n"

    1: "¹ Hear, my children, the instruction of a father,\nAnd give attention to know\
      \ understanding;\n"
    2: "² For I give you good doctrine:\nDo not forsake my law.\n"
    3: "³ When I was my father’s son,\nTender and the only one in the sight of my\
      \ mother,\n"
    4: "⁴ He also taught me, and said to me:\n“Let your heart retain my words;\nKeep\

    14: "¹⁴ Do not enter the path of the wicked,\nAnd do not walk in the way of evil.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Avoid it, do not travel on it;\nTurn away from it and pass on.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For they do not sleep unless they have done evil;\nAnd their sleep is\
      \ taken away unless they make someone fall.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For they eat the bread of wickedness,\nAnd drink the wine of violence.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ But the path of the just is like the shining sun,\nThat shines ever brighter\
      \ unto the perfect day.\n"

    21: "²¹ Do not let them depart from your eyes;\nKeep them in the midst of your\

  5:
    1: "¹ My son, pay attention to my wisdom;\nLend your ear to my understanding,\n"
    2: "² That you may preserve discretion,\nAnd your lips may keep knowledge.\n"
    3: "³ For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey,\nAnd her mouth is smoother\
      \ than oil;\n"
    4: "⁴ But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,\nSharp as a two-edged sword.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her feet go down to death,\nHer steps lay hold of hell.\n"
    6: "⁶ Lest you ponder her path of life—\nHer ways are unstable;\nYou do not know\
      \ them. \n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore hear me now, my children,\nAnd do not depart from the words of\
      \ my mouth.\n"
    8: "⁸ Remove your way far from her,\nAnd do not go near the door of her house,\n"

      \ of a foreigner;\n"
    11: "¹¹ And you mourn at last,\nWhen your flesh and your body are consumed,\n"

    13: "¹³ I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,\nNor inclined my ear to those\
      \ who instructed me!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I was on the verge of total ruin,\nIn the midst of the assembly and congregation.”\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Drink water from your own cistern,\nAnd running water from your own well.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Should your fountains be dispersed abroad,\nStreams of water in the streets?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let them be only your own,\nAnd not for strangers with you.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let your fountain be blessed,\nAnd rejoice with the wife of your youth.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ As a loving deer and a graceful doe,\nLet her breasts satisfy you at all\
      \ times;\nAnd always be enraptured with her love.\n"
    20: "²⁰ For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman,\nAnd be\
      \ embraced in the arms of a seductress? \n"
    21: "²¹ For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord,\nAnd He ponders all\
      \ his paths.\n"
    22: "²² His own iniquities entrap the wicked man,\nAnd he is caught in the cords\
      \ of his sin.\n"
    23: "²³ He shall die for lack of instruction,\nAnd in the greatness of his folly\
      \ he shall go astray."
  6:
    1: "¹ My son, if you become surety for your friend,\nIf you have shaken hands\
      \ in pledge for a stranger,\n"
    2: "² You are snared by the words of your mouth;\nYou are taken by the words of\
      \ your mouth.\n"
    3: "³ So do this, my son, and deliver yourself;\nFor you have come into the hand\
      \ of your friend:\nGo and humble yourself;\nPlead with your friend.\n"
    4: "⁴ Give no sleep to your eyes,\nNor slumber to your eyelids.\n"
    5: "⁵ Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,\nAnd like a\
      \ bird from the hand of the fowler. \n"
    6: "⁶ Go to the ant, you sluggard!\nConsider her ways and be wise,\n"
    7: "⁷ Which, having no captain,\nOverseer or ruler,\n"
    8: "⁸ Provides her supplies in the summer,\nAnd gathers her food in the harvest.\n"
    9: "⁹ How long will you slumber, O sluggard?\nWhen will you rise from your sleep?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A little sleep, a little slumber,\nA little folding of the hands to sleep—\n"
    11: "¹¹ So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler,\nAnd your need like\
      \ an armed man. \n"
    12: "¹² A worthless person, a wicked man,\nWalks with a perverse mouth;\n"
    13: "¹³ He winks with his eyes,\nHe shuffles his feet,\nHe points with his fingers;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Perversity is in his heart,\nHe devises evil continually,\nHe sows discord.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly;\nSuddenly he shall be broken\
      \ without remedy. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ These six things the Lord hates,\nYes, seven are an abomination to Him:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ A proud look,\nA lying tongue,\nHands that shed innocent blood,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ A heart that devises wicked plans,\nFeet that are swift in running to\
      \ evil,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A false witness who speaks lies,\nAnd one who sows discord among brethren.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ My son, keep your father’s command,\nAnd do not forsake the law of your\
      \ mother.\n"
    21: "²¹ Bind them continually upon your heart;\nTie them around your neck.\n"
    22: "²² When you roam, they will lead you;\nWhen you sleep, they will keep you;\n\
      And when you awake, they will speak with you.\n"
    23: "²³ For the commandment is a lamp,\nAnd the law a light;\nReproofs of instruction\
      \ are the way of life,\n"
    24: "²⁴ To keep you from the evil woman,\nFrom the flattering tongue of a seductress.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,\nNor let her allure you with\
      \ her eyelids.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For by means of a harlot\nA man is reduced to a crust of bread;\nAnd an\
      \ adulteress will prey upon his precious life.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Can a man take fire to his bosom,\nAnd his clothes not be burned?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Can one walk on hot coals,\nAnd his feet not be seared?\n"
    29: "²⁹ So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;\nWhoever touches her shall\
      \ not be innocent. \n"
    30: "³⁰ People do not despise a thief\nIf he steals to satisfy himself when he\
      \ is starving.\n"
    31: "³¹ Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold;\nHe may have to give\
      \ up all the substance of his house.\n"
    32: "³² Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding;\nHe who does\
      \ so destroys his own soul.\n"
    33: "³³ Wounds and dishonor he will get,\nAnd his reproach will not be wiped away.\n"
    34: "³⁴ For jealousy is a husband’s fury;\nTherefore he will not spare in the\
      \ day of vengeance.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He will accept no recompense,\nNor will he be appeased though you give\
      \ many gifts."
  7:
    1: "¹ My son, keep my words,\nAnd treasure my commands within you.\n"
    2: "² Keep my commands and live,\nAnd my law as the apple of your eye.\n"
    3: "³ Bind them on your fingers;\nWrite them on the tablet of your heart.\n"
    4: "⁴ Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”\nAnd call understanding your nearest\
      \ kin,\n"
    5: "⁵ That they may keep you from the immoral woman,\nFrom the seductress who\
      \ flatters with her words. \n"
    6: "⁶ For at the window of my house\nI looked through my lattice,\n"
    7: "⁷ And saw among the simple,\nI perceived among the youths,\nA young man devoid\
      \ of understanding,\n"
    8: "⁸ Passing along the street near her corner;\nAnd he took the path to her house\n"
    9: "⁹ In the twilight, in the evening,\nIn the black and dark night. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And there a woman met him,\nWith the attire of a harlot, and a crafty\
      \ heart.\n"
    11: "¹¹ She was loud and rebellious,\nHer feet would not stay at home.\n"
    12: "¹² At times she was outside, at times in the open square,\nLurking at every\
      \ corner.\n"
    13: "¹³ So she caught him and kissed him;\nWith an impudent face she said to him:\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I have peace offerings with me;\nToday I have paid my vows.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So I came out to meet you,\nDiligently to seek your face,\nAnd I have\
      \ found you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I have spread my bed with tapestry,\nColored coverings of Egyptian linen.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I have perfumed my bed\nWith myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Come, let us take our fill of love until morning;\nLet us delight ourselves\
      \ with love.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For my husband is not at home;\nHe has gone on a long journey;\n"
    20: "²⁰ He has taken a bag of money with him,\nAnd will come home on the appointed\
      \ day.” \n"
    21: "²¹ With her enticing speech she caused him to yield,\nWith her flattering\
      \ lips she seduced him.\n"
    22: "²² Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter,\nOr as\
      \ a fool to the correction of the stocks,\n"
    23: "²³ Till an arrow struck his liver.\nAs a bird hastens to the snare,\nHe did\
      \ not know it would cost his life. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Now therefore, listen to me, my children;\nPay attention to the words\
      \ of my mouth:\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,\nDo not stray into her paths;\n"
    26: "²⁶ For she has cast down many wounded,\nAnd all who were slain by her were\
      \ strong men.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Her house is the way to hell,\nDescending to the chambers of death."
  8:
    1: "¹ Does not wisdom cry out,\nAnd understanding lift up her voice?\n"
    2: "² She takes her stand on the top of the high hill,\nBeside the way, where\
      \ the paths meet.\n"
    3: "³ She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city,\nAt the entrance of\
      \ the doors:\n"
    4: "⁴ “To you, O men, I call,\nAnd my voice is to the sons of men.\n"
    5: "⁵ O you simple ones, understand prudence,\nAnd you fools, be of an understanding\
      \ heart.\n"
    6: "⁶ Listen, for I will speak of excellent things,\nAnd from the opening of my\
      \ lips will come right things;\n"
    7: "⁷ For my mouth will speak truth;\nWickedness is an abomination to my lips.\n"
    8: "⁸ All the words of my mouth are with righteousness;\nNothing crooked or perverse\
      \ is in them.\n"
    9: "⁹ They are all plain to him who understands,\nAnd right to those who find\
      \ knowledge.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Receive my instruction, and not silver,\nAnd knowledge rather than choice\
      \ gold;\n"
    11: "¹¹ For wisdom is better than rubies,\nAnd all the things one may desire cannot\
      \ be compared with her. \n"
    12: "¹² “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,\nAnd find out knowledge and discretion.\n"
    13: "¹³ The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;\nPride and arrogance and the evil\
      \ way\nAnd the perverse mouth I hate.\n"
