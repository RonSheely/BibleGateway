Amos:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Amos, who was among the sheepbreeders of Tekoa, which he saw\
      \ concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of\
      \ Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And he said:\n“The Lord roars from Zion,\nAnd utters His voice from Jerusalem;\n\
      The pastures of the shepherds mourn,\nAnd the top of Carmel withers.” \n"
    3: "³ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause they have threshed Gilead with\
      \ implements of iron.\n"
    4: "⁴ But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,\nWhich shall devour the\
      \ palaces of Ben-Hadad.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will also break the gate bar of Damascus,\nAnd cut off the inhabitant\
      \ from the Valley of Aven,\nAnd the one who holds the scepter from Beth Eden.\n\
      The people of Syria shall go captive to Kir,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause they took captive the whole captivity\n\
      To deliver them up to Edom.\n"
    7: "⁷ But I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza,\nWhich shall devour its palaces.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,\nAnd the one who holds the scepter\
      \ from Ashkelon;\nI will turn My hand against Ekron,\nAnd the remnant of the\
      \ Philistines shall perish,”\nSays the Lord God. \n"
    9: "⁹ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause they delivered up the whole captivity\
      \ to Edom,\nAnd did not remember the covenant of brotherhood.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre,\nWhich shall devour its\
      \ palaces.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Edom, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause he pursued his brother with the\
      \ sword,\nAnd cast off all pity;\nHis anger tore perpetually,\nAnd he kept his\
      \ wrath forever.\n"
    12: "¹² But I will send a fire upon Teman,\nWhich shall devour the palaces of\
      \ Bozrah.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of the people of Ammon,\
      \ and for four,\nI will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause they ripped open\
      \ the women with child in Gilead,\nThat they might enlarge their territory.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,\nAnd it shall devour its\
      \ palaces,\nAmid shouting in the day of battle,\nAnd a tempest in the day of\
      \ the whirlwind.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Their king shall go into captivity,\nHe and his princes together,”\nSays\
      \ the Lord."
  2:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause he burned the bones of the king\
      \ of Edom to lime.\n"
    2: "² But I will send a fire upon Moab,\nAnd it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth;\n\
      Moab shall die with tumult,\nWith shouting and trumpet sound.\n"
    3: "³ And I will cut off the judge from its midst,\nAnd slay all its princes with\
      \ him,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause they have despised the law of\
      \ the Lord,\nAnd have not kept His commandments.\nTheir lies lead them astray,\n\
      Lies which their fathers followed.\n"
    5: "⁵ But I will send a fire upon Judah,\nAnd it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ Thus says the Lord:\n“For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,\n\
      I will not turn away its punishment,\nBecause they sell the righteous for silver,\n\
      And the poor for a pair of sandals.\n"
    7: "⁷ They pant after the dust of the earth which is on the head of the poor,\n\
      And pervert the way of the humble.\nA man and his father go in to the same girl,\n\
      To defile My holy name.\n"
    8: "⁸ They lie down by every altar on clothes taken in pledge,\nAnd drink the\
      \ wine of the condemned in the house of their god. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,\nWhose height was like\
      \ the height of the cedars,\nAnd he was as strong as the oaks;\nYet I destroyed\
      \ his fruit above\nAnd his roots beneath.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Also it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,\nAnd led you\
      \ forty years through the wilderness,\nTo possess the land of the Amorite.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I raised up some of your sons as prophets,\nAnd some of your young men\
      \ as Nazirites.\nIs it not so, O you children of Israel?”\nSays the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink,\nAnd commanded the prophets\
      \ saying,\n‘Do not prophesy!’ \n"
    13: "¹³ “Behold, I am weighed down by you,\nAs a cart full of sheaves is weighed\
      \ down.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore flight shall perish from the swift,\nThe strong shall not strengthen\
      \ his power,\nNor shall the mighty deliver himself;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He shall not stand who handles the bow,\nThe swift of foot shall not escape,\n\
      Nor shall he who rides a horse deliver himself.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The most courageous men of might\nShall flee naked in that day,”\nSays\
      \ the Lord."
  3:
    1: "¹ Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O children of Israel,\
      \ against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² “You only have I known of all the families of the earth;\nTherefore I will\
      \ punish you for all your iniquities.” \n"
    3: "³ Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?\n"
    4: "⁴ Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey?\nWill a young lion\
      \ cry out of his den, if he has caught nothing?\n"
    5: "⁵ Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth, where there is no trap for it?\n\
      Will a snare spring up from the earth, if it has caught nothing at all?\n"
    6: "⁶ If a trumpet is blown in a city, will not the people be afraid?\nIf there\
      \ is calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done it? \n"
    7: "⁷ Surely the Lord God does nothing,\nUnless He reveals His secret to His servants\
      \ the prophets.\n"
    8: "⁸ A lion has roared!\nWho will not fear?\nThe Lord God has spoken!\nWho can\
      \ but prophesy? \n"
    9: "⁹ “Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,\nAnd in the palaces in the land of Egypt,\
      \ and say:\n‘Assemble on the mountains of Samaria;\nSee great tumults in her\
      \ midst,\nAnd the oppressed within her.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For they do not know to do right,’\nSays the Lord,\n‘Who store up violence\
      \ and robbery in their palaces.’ ” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n“An adversary shall be all around the\
      \ land;\nHe shall sap your strength from you,\nAnd your palaces shall be plundered.”\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Thus says the Lord:\n“As a shepherd takes from the mouth of a lion\nTwo\
      \ legs or a piece of an ear,\nSo shall the children of Israel be taken out\n\
      Who dwell in Samaria—\nIn the corner of a bed and on the edge of a couch!\n"
    13: "¹³ Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,”\nSays the Lord God, the\
      \ God of hosts,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “That in the day I punish Israel for their transgressions,\nI will also\
      \ visit destruction on the altars of Bethel;\nAnd the horns of the altar shall\
      \ be cut off\nAnd fall to the ground.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will destroy the winter house along with the summer house;\nThe houses\
      \ of ivory shall perish,\nAnd the great houses shall have an end,”\nSays the\
      \ Lord."
  4:
    1: "¹ Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria,\n\
      Who oppress the poor,\nWho crush the needy,\nWho say to your husbands, “Bring\
      \ wine, let us drink!”\n"
    2: "² The Lord God has sworn by His holiness:\n“Behold, the days shall come upon\
      \ you\nWhen He will take you away with fishhooks,\nAnd your posterity with fishhooks.\n"
    3: "³ You will go out through broken walls,\nEach one straight ahead of her,\n\
      And you will be cast into Harmon,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Come to Bethel and transgress,\nAt Gilgal multiply transgression;\nBring\
      \ your sacrifices every morning,\nYour tithes every three days.\n"
    5: "⁵ Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,\nProclaim and announce the\
      \ freewill offerings;\nFor this you love,\nYou children of Israel!”\nSays the\
      \ Lord God. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Also I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\nAnd lack of bread\
      \ in all your places;\nYet you have not returned to Me,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    7: "⁷ “I also withheld rain from you,\nWhen there were still three months to the\
      \ harvest.\nI made it rain on one city,\nI withheld rain from another city.\n\
      One part was rained upon,\nAnd where it did not rain the part withered.\n"
    8: "⁸ So two or three cities wandered to another city to drink water,\nBut they\
      \ were not satisfied;\nYet you have not returned to Me,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ “I blasted you with blight and mildew.\nWhen your gardens increased,\nYour\
      \ vineyards,\nYour fig trees,\nAnd your olive trees,\nThe locust devoured them;\n\
      Yet you have not returned to Me,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “I sent among you a plague after the manner of Egypt;\nYour young men\
      \ I killed with a sword,\nAlong with your captive horses;\nI made the stench\
      \ of your camps come up into your nostrils;\nYet you have not returned to Me,”\n\
      Says the Lord. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “I overthrew some of you,\nAs God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,\nAnd you\
      \ were like a firebrand plucked from the burning;\nYet you have not returned\
      \ to Me,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore thus will I do to you, O Israel;\nBecause I will do this to\
      \ you,\nPrepare to meet your God, O Israel!” \n"
    13: "¹³ For behold,\nHe who forms mountains,\nAnd creates the wind,\nWho declares\
      \ to man what his thought is,\nAnd makes the morning darkness,\nWho treads the\
      \ high places of the earth—\nThe Lord God of hosts is His name."
  5:
    1: "¹ Hear this word which I take up against you, a lamentation, O house of Israel:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² The virgin of Israel has fallen;\nShe will rise no more.\nShe lies forsaken\
      \ on her land;\nThere is no one to raise her up. \n"
    3: "³ For thus says the Lord God:\n“The city that goes out by a thousand\nShall\
      \ have a hundred left,\nAnd that which goes out by a hundred\nShall have ten\
      \ left to the house of Israel.” \n"
    4: "⁴ For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel:\n“Seek Me and live;\n"
    5: "⁵ But do not seek Bethel,\nNor enter Gilgal,\nNor pass over to Beersheba;\n\
      For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,\nAnd Bethel shall come to nothing.\n"
    6: "⁶ Seek the Lord and live,\nLest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph,\n\
      And devour it,\nWith no one to quench it in Bethel—\n"
    7: "⁷ You who turn justice to wormwood,\nAnd lay righteousness to rest in the\
      \ earth!” \n"
    8: "⁸ He made the Pleiades and Orion;\nHe turns the shadow of death into morning\n\
      And makes the day dark as night;\nHe calls for the waters of the sea\nAnd pours\
      \ them out on the face of the earth;\nThe Lord is His name.\n"
    9: "⁹ He rains ruin upon the strong,\nSo that fury comes upon the fortress. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They hate the one who rebukes in the gate,\nAnd they abhor the one who\
      \ speaks uprightly.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, because you tread down the poor\nAnd take grain taxes from\
      \ him,\nThough you have built houses of hewn stone,\nYet you shall not dwell\
      \ in them;\nYou have planted pleasant vineyards,\nBut you shall not drink wine\
      \ from them.\n"
    12: "¹² For I know your manifold transgressions\nAnd your mighty sins:\nAfflicting\
      \ the just and taking bribes;\nDiverting the poor from justice at the gate.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore the prudent keep silent at that time,\nFor it is an evil time.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Seek good and not evil,\nThat you may live;\nSo the Lord God of hosts\
      \ will be with you,\nAs you have spoken.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Hate evil, love good;\nEstablish justice in the gate.\nIt may be that\
      \ the Lord God of hosts\nWill be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore the Lord God of hosts, the Lord, says this:\n“There shall be\
      \ wailing in all streets,\nAnd they shall say in all the highways,\n‘Alas! Alas!’\n\
      They shall call the farmer to mourning,\nAnd skillful lamenters to wailing.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ In all vineyards there shall be wailing,\nFor I will pass through you,”\n\
      Says the Lord. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord!\nFor what good is the day of\
      \ the Lord to you?\nIt will be darkness, and not light.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ It will be as though a man fled from a lion,\nAnd a bear met him!\nOr\
      \ as though he went into the house,\nLeaned his hand on the wall,\nAnd a serpent\
      \ bit him!\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light?\nIs it not very dark,\
      \ with no brightness in it? \n"
    21: "²¹ “I hate, I despise your feast days,\nAnd I do not savor your sacred assemblies.\n"
    22: "²² Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,\nI will\
      \ not accept them,\nNor will I regard your fattened peace offerings.\n"
    23: "²³ Take away from Me the noise of your songs,\nFor I will not hear the melody\
      \ of your stringed instruments.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But let justice run down like water,\nAnd righteousness like a mighty\
      \ stream. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings\nIn the wilderness forty years,\
      \ O house of Israel?\n"
    26: "²⁶ You also carried Sikkuth your king\nAnd Chiun, your idols,\nThe star of\
      \ your gods,\nWhich you made for yourselves.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Therefore I will send you into captivity beyond Damascus,”\nSays the Lord,\
      \ whose name is the God of hosts."
  6:
    1: "¹ Woe to you who are at ease in Zion,\nAnd trust in Mount Samaria,\nNotable\
      \ persons in the chief nation,\nTo whom the house of Israel comes!\n"
    2: "² Go over to Calneh and see;\nAnd from there go to Hamath the great;\nThen\
      \ go down to Gath of the Philistines.\nAre you better than these kingdoms?\n\
      Or is their territory greater than your territory? \n"
    3: "³ Woe to you who put far off the day of doom,\nWho cause the seat of violence\
      \ to come near;\n"
    4: "⁴ Who lie on beds of ivory,\nStretch out on your couches,\nEat lambs from\
      \ the flock\nAnd calves from the midst of the stall;\n"
    5: "⁵ Who sing idly to the sound of stringed instruments,\nAnd invent for yourselves\
      \ musical instruments like David;\n"
    6: "⁶ Who drink wine from bowls,\nAnd anoint yourselves with the best ointments,\n\
      But are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.\n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore they shall now go captive as the first of the captives,\nAnd those\
      \ who recline at banquets shall be removed. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord God has sworn by Himself,\nThe Lord God of hosts says:\n“I abhor\
      \ the pride of Jacob,\nAnd hate his palaces;\nTherefore I will deliver up the\
      \ city\nAnd all that is in it.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then it shall come to pass, that if ten men remain in one house, they shall
      die. '
    10: "¹⁰ And when a relative of the dead, with one who will burn the bodies, picks\
      \ up the bodies to take them out of the house, he will say to one inside the\
      \ house, “Are there any more with you?”\nThen someone will say, “None.”\nAnd\
      \ he will say, “Hold your tongue! For we dare not mention the name of the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ For behold, the Lord gives a command:\nHe will break the great house into\
      \ bits,\nAnd the little house into pieces. \n"
    12: "¹² Do horses run on rocks?\nDoes one plow there with oxen?\nYet you have\
      \ turned justice into gall,\nAnd the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,\n"
    13: "¹³ You who rejoice over Lo Debar,\nWho say, “Have we not taken Karnaim for\
      \ ourselves\nBy our own strength?” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “But, behold, I will raise up a nation against you,\nO house of Israel,”\n\
      Says the Lord God of hosts;\n“And they will afflict you from the entrance of\
      \ Hamath\nTo the Valley of the Arabah.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ Thus the Lord God showed me: Behold, He formed locust swarms at the beginning
      of the late crop; indeed it was the late crop after the king’s mowings. '
    2: "² And so it was, when they had finished eating the grass of the land, that\
      \ I said:\n“O Lord God, forgive, I pray!\nOh, that Jacob may stand,\nFor he\
      \ is small!”\n"
    3: "³ So the Lord relented concerning this.\n“It shall not be,” said the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Thus the Lord God showed me: Behold, the Lord God called for conflict by
      fire, and it consumed the great deep and devoured the territory. '
    5: "⁵ Then I said:\n“O Lord God, cease, I pray!\nOh, that Jacob may stand,\nFor\
      \ he is small!”\n"
    6: "⁶ So the Lord relented concerning this.\n“This also shall not be,” said the\
      \ Lord God. \n"
    7: '⁷ Thus He showed me: Behold, the Lord stood on a wall made with a plumb line,
      with a plumb line in His hand. '
    8: "⁸ And the Lord said to me, “Amos, what do you see?”\nAnd I said, “A plumb\
      \ line.”\nThen the Lord said:\n“Behold, I am setting a plumb line\nIn the midst\
      \ of My people Israel;\nI will not pass by them anymore.\n"
    9: "⁹ The high places of Isaac shall be desolate,\nAnd the sanctuaries of Israel\
      \ shall be laid waste.\nI will rise with the sword against the house of Jeroboam.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying,
      “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land
      is not able to bear all his words. '
    11: "¹¹ For thus Amos has said:\n‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,\nAnd Israel\
      \ shall surely be led away captive\nFrom their own land.’ ” \n"
    12: "¹² Then Amaziah said to Amos:\n“Go, you seer!\nFlee to the land of Judah.\n\
      There eat bread,\nAnd there prophesy.\n"
    13: "¹³ But never again prophesy at Bethel,\nFor it is the king’s sanctuary,\n\
      And it is the royal residence.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah:\n“I was no prophet,\nNor was\
      \ I a son of a prophet,\nBut I was a sheepbreeder\nAnd a tender of sycamore\
      \ fruit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then the Lord took me as I followed the flock,\nAnd the Lord said to me,\n\
      ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now therefore, hear the word of the Lord:\nYou say, ‘Do not prophesy against\
      \ Israel,\nAnd do not spout against the house of Isaac.’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore thus says the Lord:\n‘Your wife shall be a harlot in the city;\n\
      Your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword;\nYour land shall be divided\
      \ by survey line;\nYou shall die in a defiled land;\nAnd Israel shall surely\
      \ be led away captive\nFrom his own land.’ ”"
  8:
    1: '¹ Thus the Lord God showed me: Behold, a basket of summer fruit. '
    2: "² And He said, “Amos, what do you see?”\nSo I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”\n\
      Then the Lord said to me:\n“The end has come upon My people Israel;\nI will\
      \ not pass by them anymore.\n"
    3: "³ And the songs of the temple\nShall be wailing in that day,”\nSays the Lord\
      \ God—\n“Many dead bodies everywhere,\nThey shall be thrown out in silence.”\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ Hear this, you who swallow up the needy,\nAnd make the poor of the land\
      \ fail, \n"
    5: "⁵ Saying:\n“When will the New Moon be past,\nThat we may sell grain?\nAnd\
      \ the Sabbath,\nThat we may trade wheat?\nMaking the ephah small and the shekel\
      \ large,\nFalsifying the scales by deceit,\n"
    6: "⁶ That we may buy the poor for silver,\nAnd the needy for a pair of sandals—\n\
      Even sell the bad wheat?” \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob:\n“Surely I will never forget any\
      \ of their works.\n"
    8: "⁸ Shall the land not tremble for this,\nAnd everyone mourn who dwells in it?\n\
      All of it shall swell like the River,\nHeave and subside\nLike the River of\
      \ Egypt. \n"
    9: "⁹ “And it shall come to pass in that day,” says the Lord God,\n“That I will\
      \ make the sun go down at noon,\nAnd I will darken the earth in broad daylight;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will turn your feasts into mourning,\nAnd all your songs into lamentation;\n\
      I will bring sackcloth on every waist,\nAnd baldness on every head;\nI will\
      \ make it like mourning for an only son,\nAnd its end like a bitter day. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord God,\n“That I will send a\
      \ famine on the land,\nNot a famine of bread,\nNor a thirst for water,\nBut\
      \ of hearing the words of the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² They shall wander from sea to sea,\nAnd from north to east;\nThey shall\
      \ run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord,\nBut shall not find it. \n"
    13: "¹³ “In that day the fair virgins\nAnd strong young men\nShall faint from\
      \ thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,\nWho say,\n‘As your god lives,\
      \ O Dan!’\nAnd, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives!’\nThey shall fall and never\
      \ rise again.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and He said:\n“Strike the doorposts,\
      \ that the thresholds may shake,\nAnd break them on the heads of them all.\n\
      I will slay the last of them with the sword.\nHe who flees from them shall not\
      \ get away,\nAnd he who escapes from them shall not be delivered. \n"
    2: "² “Though they dig into hell,\nFrom there My hand shall take them;\nThough\
      \ they climb up to heaven,\nFrom there I will bring them down;\n"
    3: "³ And though they hide themselves on top of Carmel,\nFrom there I will search\
