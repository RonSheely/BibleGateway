  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of\
      \ Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the\
      \ son of Amon, king of Judah. \n"
    2: "² “I will utterly consume everything\nFrom the face of the land,”\nSays the\
      \ Lord;\n"
    3: "³ “I will consume man and beast;\nI will consume the birds of the heavens,\n\
      The fish of the sea,\nAnd the stumbling blocks along with the wicked.\nI will\
      \ cut off man from the face of the land,”\nSays the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ “I will stretch out My hand against Judah,\nAnd against all the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem.\nI will cut off every trace of Baal from this place,\nThe names\
      \ of the idolatrous priests with the pagan priests—\n"
    5: "⁵ Those who worship the host of heaven on the housetops;\nThose who worship\
      \ and swear oaths by the Lord,\nBut who also swear by Milcom;\n"
    6: "⁶ Those who have turned back from following the Lord,\nAnd have not sought\
      \ the Lord, nor inquired of Him.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Be silent in the presence of the Lord God;\nFor the day of the Lord is at\
      \ hand,\nFor the Lord has prepared a sacrifice;\nHe has invited His guests.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “And it shall be,\nIn the day of the Lord’s sacrifice,\nThat I will punish\
      \ the princes and the king’s children,\nAnd all such as are clothed with foreign\
      \ apparel.\n"
    9: "⁹ In the same day I will punish\nAll those who leap over the threshold,\n\
      Who fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “And there shall be on that day,” says the Lord,\n“The sound of a mournful\
      \ cry from the Fish Gate,\nA wailing from the Second Quarter,\nAnd a loud crashing\
      \ from the hills.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh!\nFor all the merchant people are cut\
      \ down;\nAll those who handle money are cut off. \n"
    12: "¹² “And it shall come to pass at that time\nThat I will search Jerusalem\
      \ with lamps,\nAnd punish the men\nWho are settled in complacency,\nWho say\
      \ in their heart,\n‘The Lord will not do good,\nNor will He do evil.’\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore their goods shall become booty,\nAnd their houses a desolation;\n\
      They shall build houses, but not inhabit them;\nThey shall plant vineyards,\
      \ but not drink their wine.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The great day of the Lord is near;\nIt is near and hastens quickly.\n\
      The noise of the day of the Lord is bitter;\nThere the mighty men shall cry\
      \ out.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ That day is a day of wrath,\nA day of trouble and distress,\nA day of\
      \ devastation and desolation,\nA day of darkness and gloominess,\nA day of clouds\
      \ and thick darkness,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ A day of trumpet and alarm\nAgainst the fortified cities\nAnd against\
      \ the high towers. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “I will bring distress upon men,\nAnd they shall walk like blind men,\n\
      Because they have sinned against the Lord;\nTheir blood shall be poured out\
      \ like dust,\nAnd their flesh like refuse.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither their silver nor their gold\nShall be able to deliver them\nIn\
      \ the day of the Lord’s wrath;\nBut the whole land shall be devoured\nBy the\
      \ fire of His jealousy,\nFor He will make speedy riddance\nOf all those who\
      \ dwell in the land."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together,\nO undesirable nation,\n"
    2: "² Before the decree is issued,\nOr the day passes like chaff,\nBefore the\
      \ Lord’s fierce anger comes upon you,\nBefore the day of the Lord’s anger comes\
      \ upon you!\n"
    3: "³ Seek the Lord, all you meek of the earth,\nWho have upheld His justice.\n\
      Seek righteousness, seek humility.\nIt may be that you will be hidden\nIn the\
      \ day of the Lord’s anger. \n"
    4: "⁴ For Gaza shall be forsaken,\nAnd Ashkelon desolate;\nThey shall drive out\
      \ Ashdod at noonday,\nAnd Ekron shall be uprooted.\n"
    5: "⁵ Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast,\nThe nation of the Cherethites!\n\
      The word of the Lord is against you,\nO Canaan, land of the Philistines:\n“I\
      \ will destroy you;\nSo there shall be no inhabitant.” \n"
    6: "⁶ The seacoast shall be pastures,\nWith shelters for shepherds and folds for\
      \ flocks.\n"
    7: "⁷ The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah;\nThey shall feed\
      \ their flocks there;\nIn the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at evening.\n\
      For the Lord their God will intervene for them,\nAnd return their captives.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “I have heard the reproach of Moab,\nAnd the insults of the people of Ammon,\n\
      With which they have reproached My people,\nAnd made arrogant threats against\
      \ their borders.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, as I live,”\nSays the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,\n“Surely\
      \ Moab shall be like Sodom,\nAnd the people of Ammon like Gomorrah—\nOverrun\
      \ with weeds and saltpits,\nAnd a perpetual desolation.\nThe residue of My people\
      \ shall plunder them,\nAnd the remnant of My people shall possess them.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ This they shall have for their pride,\nBecause they have reproached and\
      \ made arrogant threats\nAgainst the people of the Lord of hosts.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will be awesome to them,\nFor He will reduce to nothing all the\
      \ gods of the earth;\nPeople shall worship Him,\nEach one from his place,\n\
      Indeed all the shores of the nations. \n"
    12: "¹² “You Ethiopians also,\nYou shall be slain by My sword.” \n"
    13: "¹³ And He will stretch out His hand against the north,\nDestroy Assyria,\n\
      And make Nineveh a desolation,\nAs dry as the wilderness.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The herds shall lie down in her midst,\nEvery beast of the nation.\nBoth\
      \ the pelican and the bittern\nShall lodge on the capitals of her pillars;\n\
      Their voice shall sing in the windows;\nDesolation shall be at the threshold;\n\
      For He will lay bare the cedar work.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is the rejoicing city\nThat dwelt securely,\nThat said in her heart,\n\
      “I am it, and there is none besides me.”\nHow has she become a desolation,\n\
      A place for beasts to lie down!\nEveryone who passes by her\nShall hiss and\
      \ shake his fist."
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted,\nTo the oppressing city!\n"
    2: "² She has not obeyed His voice,\nShe has not received correction;\nShe has\
      \ not trusted in the Lord,\nShe has not drawn near to her God. \n"
    3: "³ Her princes in her midst are roaring lions;\nHer judges are evening wolves\n\
      That leave not a bone till morning.\n"
    4: "⁴ Her prophets are insolent, treacherous people;\nHer priests have polluted\
      \ the sanctuary,\nThey have done violence to the law.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord is righteous in her midst,\nHe will do no unrighteousness.\nEvery\
      \ morning He brings His justice to light;\nHe never fails,\nBut the unjust knows\
      \ no shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I have cut off nations,\nTheir fortresses are devastated;\nI have made\
      \ their streets desolate,\nWith none passing by.\nTheir cities are destroyed;\n\
      There is no one, no inhabitant.\n"
    7: "⁷ I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me,\nYou will receive instruction’—\nSo that\
      \ her dwelling would not be cut off,\nDespite everything for which I punished\
      \ her.\nBut they rose early and corrupted all their deeds. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Therefore wait for Me,” says the Lord,\n“Until the day I rise up for plunder;\n\
      My determination is to gather the nations\nTo My assembly of kingdoms,\nTo pour\
      \ on them My indignation,\nAll My fierce anger;\nAll the earth shall be devoured\n\
      With the fire of My jealousy. \n"
    9: "⁹ “For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language,\nThat they all\
      \ may call on the name of the Lord,\nTo serve Him with one accord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia\nMy worshipers,\nThe daughter of My\
      \ dispersed ones,\nShall bring My offering.\n"
    11: "¹¹ In that day you shall not be shamed for any of your deeds\nIn which you\
      \ transgress against Me;\nFor then I will take away from your midst\nThose who\
      \ rejoice in your pride,\nAnd you shall no longer be haughty\nIn My holy mountain.\n"
    12: "¹² I will leave in your midst\nA meek and humble people,\nAnd they shall\
      \ trust in the name of the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ The remnant of Israel shall do no unrighteousness\nAnd speak no lies,\n\
      Nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth;\nFor they shall feed their\
      \ flocks and lie down,\nAnd no one shall make them afraid.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sing, O daughter of Zion!\nShout, O Israel!\nBe glad and rejoice with\
      \ all your heart,\nO daughter of Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has taken away your judgments,\nHe has cast out your enemy.\n\
      The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;\nYou shall see disaster no more.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:\n“Do not fear;\nZion, let not\
      \ your hands be weak.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord your God in your midst,\nThe Mighty One, will save;\nHe will\
      \ rejoice over you with gladness,\nHe will quiet you with His love,\nHe will\
      \ rejoice over you with singing.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I will gather those who sorrow over the appointed assembly,\nWho are\
      \ among you,\nTo whom its reproach is a burden.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, at that time\nI will deal with all who afflict you;\nI will save\
      \ the lame,\nAnd gather those who were driven out;\nI will appoint them for\
      \ praise and fame\nIn every land where they were put to shame.\n"
    20: "²⁰ At that time I will bring you back,\nEven at the time I gather you;\n\
      For I will give you fame and praise\nAmong all the peoples of the earth,\nWhen\
      \ I return your captives before your eyes,”\nSays the Lord."
