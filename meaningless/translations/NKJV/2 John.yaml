2 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The Elder,\nTo the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and\
      \ not only I, but also all those who have known the truth, "
    2: "² because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: \n"
    3: "³ Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the\
      \ Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. \n"
    4: '⁴ I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth,
      as we received commandment from the Father. '
    5: '⁵ And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment
      to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. '
    6: "⁶ This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment,\
      \ that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it. \n"
    7: '⁷ For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus
      Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. '
    8: "⁸ Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but\
      \ that we may receive a full reward. \n"
    9: '⁹ Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not
      have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the
      Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive
      him into your house nor greet him; '
    11: "¹¹ for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds. \n"
    12: "¹² Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper\
      \ and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may\
      \ be full. \n"
    13: ¹³ The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
