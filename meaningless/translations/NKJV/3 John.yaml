3 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The Elder,\nTo the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth: \n"
    2: '² Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just
      as your soul prospers. '
    3: '³ For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that
      is in you, just as you walk in the truth. '
    4: "⁴ I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. \n"
    5: '⁵ Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers, '
    6: '⁶ who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them
      forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well, '
    7: '⁷ because they went forth for His name’s sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles. '
    8: "⁸ We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for\
      \ the truth. \n"
    9: '⁹ I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence
      among them, does not receive us. '
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating\
      \ against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does\
      \ not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out\
      \ of the church. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good\
      \ is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. \n"
    12: "¹² Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And\
      \ we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true. \n"
    13: '¹³ I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen
      and ink; '
    14: "¹⁴ but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face.\nPeace\
      \ to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
