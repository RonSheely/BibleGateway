Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "¹ How lonely sits the city\nThat was full of people!\nHow like a widow is\
      \ she,\nWho was great among the nations!\nThe princess among the provinces\n\
      Has become a slave! \n"
    2: "² She weeps bitterly in the night,\nHer tears are on her cheeks;\nAmong all\
      \ her lovers\nShe has none to comfort her.\nAll her friends have dealt treacherously\
      \ with her;\nThey have become her enemies. \n"
    3: "³ Judah has gone into captivity,\nUnder affliction and hard servitude;\nShe\
      \ dwells among the nations,\nShe finds no rest;\nAll her persecutors overtake\
      \ her in dire straits. \n"
    4: "⁴ The roads to Zion mourn\nBecause no one comes to the set feasts.\nAll her\
      \ gates are desolate;\nHer priests sigh,\nHer virgins are afflicted,\nAnd she\
      \ is in bitterness. \n"
    5: "⁵ Her adversaries have become the master,\nHer enemies prosper;\nFor the Lord\
      \ has afflicted her\nBecause of the multitude of her transgressions.\nHer children\
      \ have gone into captivity before the enemy. \n"
    6: "⁶ And from the daughter of Zion\nAll her splendor has departed.\nHer princes\
      \ have become like deer\nThat find no pasture,\nThat flee without strength\n\
      Before the pursuer. \n"
    7: "⁷ In the days of her affliction and roaming,\nJerusalem remembers all her\
      \ pleasant things\nThat she had in the days of old.\nWhen her people fell into\
      \ the hand of the enemy,\nWith no one to help her,\nThe adversaries saw her\n\
      And mocked at her downfall. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem has sinned gravely,\nTherefore she has become vile.\nAll who honored\
      \ her despise her\nBecause they have seen her nakedness;\nYes, she sighs and\
      \ turns away. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her uncleanness is in her skirts;\nShe did not consider her destiny;\nTherefore\
      \ her collapse was awesome;\nShe had no comforter.\n“O Lord, behold my affliction,\n\
      For the enemy is exalted!” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The adversary has spread his hand\nOver all her pleasant things;\nFor\
      \ she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary,\nThose whom You commanded\n\
      Not to enter Your assembly. \n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people sigh,\nThey seek bread;\nThey have given their valuables\
      \ for food to restore life.\n“See, O Lord, and consider,\nFor I am scorned.”\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\nBehold and see\nIf there\
      \ is any sorrow like my sorrow,\nWhich has been brought on me,\nWhich the Lord\
      \ has inflicted\nIn the day of His fierce anger. \n"
    13: "¹³ “From above He has sent fire into my bones,\nAnd it overpowered them;\n\
      He has spread a net for my feet\nAnd turned me back;\nHe has made me desolate\n\
      And faint all the day. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “The yoke of my transgressions was bound;\nThey were woven together by\
      \ His hands,\nAnd thrust upon my neck.\nHe made my strength fail;\nThe Lord\
      \ delivered me into the hands of those whom I am not able to withstand. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “The Lord has trampled underfoot all my mighty men in my midst;\nHe has\
      \ called an assembly against me\nTo crush my young men;\nThe Lord trampled as\
      \ in a winepress\nThe virgin daughter of Judah. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “For these things I weep;\nMy eye, my eye overflows with water;\nBecause\
      \ the comforter, who should restore my life,\nIs far from me.\nMy children are\
      \ desolate\nBecause the enemy prevailed.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion spreads out her hands,\nBut no one comforts her;\nThe Lord has commanded\
      \ concerning Jacob\nThat those around him become his adversaries;\nJerusalem\
      \ has become an unclean thing among them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The Lord is righteous,\nFor I rebelled against His commandment.\nHear\
      \ now, all peoples,\nAnd behold my sorrow;\nMy virgins and my young men\nHave\
      \ gone into captivity. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I called for my lovers,\nBut they deceived me;\nMy priests and my elders\n\
      Breathed their last in the city,\nWhile they sought food\nTo restore their life.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “See, O Lord, that I am in distress;\nMy soul is troubled;\nMy heart is\
      \ overturned within me,\nFor I have been very rebellious.\nOutside the sword\
      \ bereaves,\nAt home it is like death. \n"
    21: "²¹ “They have heard that I sigh,\nBut no one comforts me.\nAll my enemies\
      \ have heard of my trouble;\nThey are glad that You have done it.\nBring on\
      \ the day You have announced,\nThat they may become like me. \n"
    22: "²² “Let all their wickedness come before You,\nAnd do to them as You have\
      \ done to me\nFor all my transgressions;\nFor my sighs are many,\nAnd my heart\
      \ is faint.”"
  2:
    1: "¹ How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion\nWith a cloud in His anger!\n\
      He cast down from heaven to the earth\nThe beauty of Israel,\nAnd did not remember\
      \ His footstool\nIn the day of His anger. \n"
    2: "² The Lord has swallowed up and has not pitied\nAll the dwelling places of\
      \ Jacob.\nHe has thrown down in His wrath\nThe strongholds of the daughter of\
      \ Judah;\nHe has brought them down to the ground;\nHe has profaned the kingdom\
      \ and its princes. \n"
    3: "³ He has cut off in fierce anger\nEvery horn of Israel;\nHe has drawn back\
      \ His right hand\nFrom before the enemy.\nHe has blazed against Jacob like a\
      \ flaming fire\nDevouring all around. \n"
    4: "⁴ Standing like an enemy, He has bent His bow;\nWith His right hand, like\
      \ an adversary,\nHe has slain all who were pleasing to His eye;\nOn the tent\
      \ of the daughter of Zion,\nHe has poured out His fury like fire. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord was like an enemy.\nHe has swallowed up Israel,\nHe has swallowed\
      \ up all her palaces;\nHe has destroyed her strongholds,\nAnd has increased\
      \ mourning and lamentation\nIn the daughter of Judah. \n"
    6: "⁶ He has done violence to His tabernacle,\nAs if it were a garden;\nHe has\
      \ destroyed His place of assembly;\nThe Lord has caused\nThe appointed feasts\
      \ and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion.\nIn His burning indignation He has spurned\
      \ the king and the priest. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has spurned His altar,\nHe has abandoned His sanctuary;\nHe has\
      \ given up the walls of her palaces\nInto the hand of the enemy.\nThey have\
      \ made a noise in the house of the Lord\nAs on the day of a set feast. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord has purposed to destroy\nThe wall of the daughter of Zion.\nHe\
      \ has stretched out a line;\nHe has not withdrawn His hand from destroying;\n\
      Therefore He has caused the rampart and wall to lament;\nThey languished together.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground;\nHe has destroyed and broken her bars.\n\
      Her king and her princes are among the nations;\nThe Law is no more,\nAnd her\
      \ prophets find no vision from the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of the daughter of Zion\nSit on the ground and keep silence;\n\
      They throw dust on their heads\nAnd gird themselves with sackcloth.\nThe virgins\
      \ of Jerusalem\nBow their heads to the ground. \n"
    11: "¹¹ My eyes fail with tears,\nMy heart is troubled;\nMy bile is poured on\
      \ the ground\nBecause of the destruction of the daughter of my people,\nBecause\
      \ the children and the infants\nFaint in the streets of the city. \n"
    12: "¹² They say to their mothers,\n“Where is grain and wine?”\nAs they swoon\
      \ like the wounded\nIn the streets of the city,\nAs their life is poured out\n\
      In their mothers’ bosom. \n"
    13: "¹³ How shall I console you?\nTo what shall I liken you,\nO daughter of Jerusalem?\n\
      What shall I compare with you, that I may comfort you,\nO virgin daughter of\
      \ Zion?\nFor your ruin is spread wide as the sea;\nWho can heal you? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your prophets have seen for you\nFalse and deceptive visions;\nThey have\
      \ not uncovered your iniquity,\nTo bring back your captives,\nBut have envisioned\
      \ for you false prophecies and delusions. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who pass by clap their hands at you;\nThey hiss and shake their heads\n\
      At the daughter of Jerusalem:\n“Is this the city that is called\n‘The perfection\
      \ of beauty,\nThe joy of the whole earth’?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All your enemies have opened their mouth against you;\nThey hiss and gnash\
      \ their teeth.\nThey say, “We have swallowed her up!\nSurely this is the day\
      \ we have waited for;\nWe have found it, we have seen it!” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord has done what He purposed;\nHe has fulfilled His word\nWhich\
      \ He commanded in days of old.\nHe has thrown down and has not pitied,\nAnd\
      \ He has caused an enemy to rejoice over you;\nHe has exalted the horn of your\
      \ adversaries. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their heart cried out to the Lord,\n“O wall of the daughter of Zion,\n\
      Let tears run down like a river day and night;\nGive yourself no relief;\nGive\
      \ your eyes no rest. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Arise, cry out in the night,\nAt the beginning of the watches;\nPour\
      \ out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.\nLift your hands toward\
      \ Him\nFor the life of your young children,\nWho faint from hunger at the head\
      \ of every street.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ “See, O Lord, and consider!\nTo whom have You done this?\nShould the women\
      \ eat their offspring,\nThe children they have cuddled?\nShould the priest and\
      \ prophet be slain\nIn the sanctuary of the Lord? \n"
    21: "²¹ “Young and old lie\nOn the ground in the streets;\nMy virgins and my young\
      \ men\nHave fallen by the sword;\nYou have slain them in the day of Your anger,\n\
      You have slaughtered and not pitied. \n"
    22: "²² “You have invited as to a feast day\nThe terrors that surround me.\nIn\
      \ the day of the Lord’s anger\nThere was no refugee or survivor.\nThose whom\
      \ I have borne and brought up\nMy enemies have destroyed.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.\n"
    2: "² He has led me and made me walk\nIn darkness and not in light.\n"
    3: "³ Surely He has turned His hand against me\nTime and time again throughout\
      \ the day. \n"
    4: "⁴ He has aged my flesh and my skin,\nAnd broken my bones.\n"
    5: "⁵ He has besieged me\nAnd surrounded me with bitterness and woe.\n"
    6: "⁶ He has set me in dark places\nLike the dead of long ago. \n"
    7: "⁷ He has hedged me in so that I cannot get out;\nHe has made my chain heavy.\n"
    8: "⁸ Even when I cry and shout,\nHe shuts out my prayer.\n"
    9: "⁹ He has blocked my ways with hewn stone;\nHe has made my paths crooked. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He has been to me a bear lying in wait,\nLike a lion in ambush.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces;\nHe has made me desolate.\n"
    12: "¹² He has bent His bow\nAnd set me up as a target for the arrow. \n"
    13: "¹³ He has caused the arrows of His quiver\nTo pierce my loins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have become the ridicule of all my people—\nTheir taunting song all\
      \ the day.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He has filled me with bitterness,\nHe has made me drink wormwood. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He has also broken my teeth with gravel,\nAnd covered me with ashes.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ You have moved my soul far from peace;\nI have forgotten prosperity.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ And I said, “My strength and my hope\nHave perished from the Lord.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Remember my affliction and roaming,\nThe wormwood and the gall.\n"
    20: "²⁰ My soul still remembers\nAnd sinks within me.\n"
    21: "²¹ This I recall to my mind,\nTherefore I have hope. \n"
    22: "²² Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed,\nBecause His compassions\
      \ fail not.\n"
    23: "²³ They are new every morning;\nGreat is Your faithfulness.\n"
    24: "²⁴ “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,\n“Therefore I hope in Him!” \n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord is good to those who wait for Him,\nTo the soul who seeks Him.\n"
    26: "²⁶ It is good that one should hope and wait quietly\nFor the salvation of\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    27: "²⁷ It is good for a man to bear\nThe yoke in his youth. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Let him sit alone and keep silent,\nBecause God has laid it on him;\n"
    29: "²⁹ Let him put his mouth in the dust—\nThere may yet be hope.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him,\nAnd be full of reproach.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ For the Lord will not cast off forever.\n"
    32: "³² Though He causes grief,\nYet He will show compassion\nAccording to the\
      \ multitude of His mercies.\n"
    33: "³³ For He does not afflict willingly,\nNor grieve the children of men. \n"
    34: "³⁴ To crush under one’s feet\nAll the prisoners of the earth,\n"
    35: "³⁵ To turn aside the justice due a man\nBefore the face of the Most High,\n"
    36: "³⁶ Or subvert a man in his cause—\nThe Lord does not approve. \n"
    37: "³⁷ Who is he who speaks and it comes to pass,\nWhen the Lord has not commanded\
      \ it?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Is it not from the mouth of the Most High\nThat woe and well-being proceed?\n"
    39: "³⁹ Why should a living man complain,\nA man for the punishment of his sins?\
      \ \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Let us search out and examine our ways,\nAnd turn back to the Lord;\n"
    41: "⁴¹ Let us lift our hearts and hands\nTo God in heaven.\n"
    42: "⁴² We have transgressed and rebelled;\nYou have not pardoned. \n"
    43: "⁴³ You have covered Yourself with anger\nAnd pursued us;\nYou have slain\
      \ and not pitied.\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ You have covered Yourself with a cloud,\nThat prayer should not pass through.\n"
    45: "⁴⁵ You have made us an offscouring and refuse\nIn the midst of the peoples.\
      \ \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ All our enemies\nHave opened their mouths against us.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Fear and a snare have come upon us,\nDesolation and destruction.\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ My eyes overflow with rivers of water\nFor the destruction of the daughter\
      \ of my people. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ My eyes flow and do not cease,\nWithout interruption,\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Till the Lord from heaven\nLooks down and sees.\n"

      \ city. \n"

    54: "⁵⁴ The waters flowed over my head;\nI said, “I am cut off!” \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ I called on Your name, O Lord,\nFrom the lowest pit.\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ You have heard my voice:\n“Do not hide Your ear\nFrom my sighing, from\
      \ my cry for help.”\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ You drew near on the day I called on You,\nAnd said, “Do not fear!” \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ O Lord, You have pleaded the case for my soul;\nYou have redeemed my life.\n"
    59: "⁵⁹ O Lord, You have seen how I am wronged;\nJudge my case.\n"
    60: "⁶⁰ You have seen all their vengeance,\nAll their schemes against me. \n"
    61: "⁶¹ You have heard their reproach, O Lord,\nAll their schemes against me,\n"
    62: "⁶² The lips of my enemies\nAnd their whispering against me all the day.\n"
    63: "⁶³ Look at their sitting down and their rising up;\nI am their taunting song.\
      \ \n"
    64: "⁶⁴ Repay them, O Lord,\nAccording to the work of their hands.\n"
    65: "⁶⁵ Give them a veiled heart;\nYour curse be upon them!\n"
    66: "⁶⁶ In Your anger,\nPursue and destroy them\nFrom under the heavens of the\
      \ Lord."
  4:
    1: "¹ How the gold has become dim!\nHow changed the fine gold!\nThe stones of\
      \ the sanctuary are scattered\nAt the head of every street. \n"
    2: "² The precious sons of Zion,\nValuable as fine gold,\nHow they are regarded\
      \ as clay pots,\nThe work of the hands of the potter! \n"
    3: "³ Even the jackals present their breasts\nTo nurse their young;\nBut the daughter\
      \ of my people is cruel,\nLike ostriches in the wilderness. \n"
    4: "⁴ The tongue of the infant clings\nTo the roof of its mouth for thirst;\n\
      The young children ask for bread,\nBut no one breaks it for them. \n"
    5: "⁵ Those who ate delicacies\nAre desolate in the streets;\nThose who were brought\
      \ up in scarlet\nEmbrace ash heaps. \n"
    6: "⁶ The punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people\nIs greater\
      \ than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,\nWhich was overthrown in a moment,\n\
      With no hand to help her! \n"
    7: "⁷ Her Nazirites were brighter than snow\nAnd whiter than milk;\nThey were\
      \ more ruddy in body than rubies,\nLike sapphire in their appearance. \n"
    8: "⁸ Now their appearance is blacker than soot;\nThey go unrecognized in the\
      \ streets;\nTheir skin clings to their bones,\nIt has become as dry as wood.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Those slain by the sword are better off\nThan those who die of hunger;\n\
      For these pine away,\nStricken for lack of the fruits of the field. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The hands of the compassionate women\nHave cooked their own children;\n\
      They became food for them\nIn the destruction of the daughter of my people.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord has fulfilled His fury,\nHe has poured out His fierce anger.\n\
      He kindled a fire in Zion,\nAnd it has devoured its foundations. \n"
    12: "¹² The kings of the earth,\nAnd all inhabitants of the world,\nWould not\
      \ have believed\nThat the adversary and the enemy\nCould enter the gates of\
      \ Jerusalem— \n"
    13: "¹³ Because of the sins of her prophets\nAnd the iniquities of her priests,\n\
      Who shed in her midst\nThe blood of the just. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ They wandered blind in the streets;\nThey have defiled themselves with\
      \ blood,\nSo that no one would touch their garments. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ They cried out to them,\n“Go away, unclean!\nGo away, go away,\nDo not\
      \ touch us!”\nWhen they fled and wandered,\nThose among the nations said,\n\
      “They shall no longer dwell here.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The face of the Lord scattered them;\nHe no longer regards them.\nThe\
      \ people do not respect the priests\nNor show favor to the elders. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Still our eyes failed us,\nWatching vainly for our help;\nIn our watching\
      \ we watched\nFor a nation that could not save us. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ They tracked our steps\nSo that we could not walk in our streets.\nOur\
      \ end was near;\nOur days were over,\nFor our end had come. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Our pursuers were swifter\nThan the eagles of the heavens.\nThey pursued\
      \ us on the mountains\nAnd lay in wait for us in the wilderness. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord,\nWas caught in their\
      \ pits,\nOf whom we said, “Under his shadow\nWe shall live among the nations.”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,\nYou who dwell in the land of\
      \ Uz!\nThe cup shall also pass over to you\nAnd you shall become drunk and make\
      \ yourself naked. \n"
    22: "²² The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished,\nO daughter of Zion;\n\
      He will no longer send you into captivity.\nHe will punish your iniquity,\n\
      O daughter of Edom;\nHe will uncover your sins!"
  5:
    1: "¹ Remember, O Lord, what has come upon us;\nLook, and behold our reproach!\n"

    12: "¹² Princes were hung up by their hands,\nAnd elders were not respected.\n"
    13: "¹³ Young men ground at the millstones;\nBoys staggered under loads of wood.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The elders have ceased gathering at the gate,\nAnd the young men from\
      \ their music. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The joy of our heart has ceased;\nOur dance has turned into mourning.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The crown has fallen from our head.\nWoe to us, for we have sinned!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Because of this our heart is faint;\nBecause of these things our eyes\
      \ grow dim;\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Because of Mount Zion which is desolate,\nWith foxes walking about on\
      \ it. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ You, O Lord, remain forever;\nYour throne from generation to generation.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Why do You forget us forever,\nAnd forsake us for so long a time?\n"
    21: "²¹ Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be restored;\nRenew our days\
      \ as of old,\n"
    22: "²² Unless You have utterly rejected us,\nAnd are very angry with us!"
