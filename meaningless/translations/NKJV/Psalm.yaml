    45: "⁴⁵ He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them,\nAnd frogs, which\
      \ destroyed them.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ He also gave their crops to the caterpillar,\nAnd their labor to the locust.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ He destroyed their vines with hail,\nAnd their sycamore trees with frost.\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ He also gave up their cattle to the hail,\nAnd their flocks to fiery lightning.\n"

    52: "⁵² But He made His own people go forth like sheep,\nAnd guided them in the\
      \ wilderness like a flock;\n"
    53: "⁵³ And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear;\nBut the sea overwhelmed\

    54: "⁵⁴ And He brought them to His holy border,\nThis mountain which His right\
      \ hand had acquired.\n"
    55: "⁵⁵ He also drove out the nations before them,\nAllotted them an inheritance\
      \ by survey,\nAnd made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents. \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God,\nAnd did not keep His\
      \ testimonies,\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers;\nThey were\
      \ turned aside like a deceitful bow.\n"
    58: "⁵⁸ For they provoked Him to anger with their high places,\nAnd moved Him\
      \ to jealousy with their carved images.\n"
    59: "⁵⁹ When God heard this, He was furious,\nAnd greatly abhorred Israel,\n"
    60: "⁶⁰ So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,\nThe tent He had placed among\
      \ men,\n"
    61: "⁶¹ And delivered His strength into captivity,\nAnd His glory into the enemy’s\
      \ hand.\n"
    62: "⁶² He also gave His people over to the sword,\nAnd was furious with His inheritance.\n"
    63: "⁶³ The fire consumed their young men,\nAnd their maidens were not given in\

    65: "⁶⁵ Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,\nLike a mighty man who shouts because\
      \ of wine.\n"
    66: "⁶⁶ And He beat back His enemies;\nHe put them to a perpetual reproach. \n"
    67: "⁶⁷ Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph,\nAnd did not choose the tribe\
      \ of Ephraim,\n"
    68: "⁶⁸ But chose the tribe of Judah,\nMount Zion which He loved.\n"
    69: "⁶⁹ And He built His sanctuary like the heights,\nLike the earth which He\
