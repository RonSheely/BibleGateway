Ecclesiastes:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. \n"
    2: "² “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher;\n“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ What profit has a man from all his labor\nIn which he toils under the sun?\n"
    4: "⁴ One generation passes away, and another generation comes;\nBut the earth\
      \ abides forever.\n"
    5: "⁵ The sun also rises, and the sun goes down,\nAnd hastens to the place where\
      \ it arose.\n"
    6: "⁶ The wind goes toward the south,\nAnd turns around to the north;\nThe wind\
      \ whirls about continually,\nAnd comes again on its circuit.\n"
    7: "⁷ All the rivers run into the sea,\nYet the sea is not full;\nTo the place\
      \ from which the rivers come,\nThere they return again.\n"
    8: "⁸ All things are full of labor;\nMan cannot express it.\nThe eye is not satisfied\
      \ with seeing,\nNor the ear filled with hearing. \n"
    9: "⁹ That which has been is what will be,\nThat which is done is what will be\
      \ done,\nAnd there is nothing new under the sun.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Is there anything of which it may be said,\n“See, this is new”?\nIt has\
      \ already been in ancient times before us.\n"
    11: "¹¹ There is no remembrance of former things,\nNor will there be any remembrance\
      \ of things that are to come\nBy those who will come after. \n"
    12: '¹² I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that
      is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man,
      by which they may be exercised. '
    14: "¹⁴ I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all\
      \ is vanity and grasping for the wind. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ What is crooked cannot be made straight,\nAnd what is lacking cannot be\
      \ numbered. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and
      have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has
      understood great wisdom and knowledge.” '
    17: "¹⁷ And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived\
      \ that this also is grasping for the wind. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For in much wisdom is much grief,\nAnd he who increases knowledge increases\
      \ sorrow."
  2:
    1: '¹ I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore enjoy
      pleasure”; but surely, this also was vanity. '
    2: '² I said of laughter—“Madness!”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?” '
    3: "³ I searched in my heart how to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding\
      \ my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what\
      \ was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards. '
    5: '⁵ I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees
      in them. '
    6: '⁶ I made myself water pools from which to water the growing trees of the grove. '
    7: '⁷ I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house.
      Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem
      before me. '
    8: "⁸ I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of\
      \ kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights\
      \ of the sons of men, and musical instruments of all kinds. \n"
    9: "⁹ So I became great and excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.\
      \ Also my wisdom remained with me. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.\nI did not withhold\
      \ my heart from any pleasure,\nFor my heart rejoiced in all my labor;\nAnd this\
      \ was my reward from all my labor.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done\nAnd on the labor\
      \ in which I had toiled;\nAnd indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.\n\
      There was no profit under the sun. \n"
    12: "¹² Then I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly;\nFor what\
      \ can the man do who succeeds the king?—\nOnly what he has already done.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then I saw that wisdom excels folly\nAs light excels darkness.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The wise man’s eyes are in his head,\nBut the fool walks in darkness.\n\
      Yet I myself perceived\nThat the same event happens to them all. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So I said in my heart,\n“As it happens to the fool,\nIt also happens to\
      \ me,\nAnd why was I then more wise?”\nThen I said in my heart,\n“This also\
      \ is vanity.”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For there is no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever,\n\
      Since all that now is will be forgotten in the days to come.\nAnd how does a\
      \ wise man die?\nAs the fool! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was\
      \ distressing to me, for all is vanity and grasping for the wind. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because
      I must leave it to the man who will come after me. '
    19: '¹⁹ And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over
      all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the
      sun. This also is vanity. '
    20: '²⁰ Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I
      had toiled under the sun. '
    21: '²¹ For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet
      he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also is
      vanity and a great evil. '
    22: '²² For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart
      with which he has toiled under the sun? '
    23: "²³ For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night\
      \ his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that
      his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand
      of God. '
    25: '²⁵ For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? '
    26: ²⁶ For God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His
      sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that
      he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping
      for the wind.
  3:
    1: "¹ To everything there is a season,\nA time for every purpose under heaven:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² A time to be born,\nAnd a time to die;\nA time to plant,\nAnd a time to\
      \ pluck what is planted;\n"
    3: "³ A time to kill,\nAnd a time to heal;\nA time to break down,\nAnd a time\
      \ to build up;\n"
    4: "⁴ A time to weep,\nAnd a time to laugh;\nA time to mourn,\nAnd a time to dance;\n"
    5: "⁵ A time to cast away stones,\nAnd a time to gather stones;\nA time to embrace,\n\
      And a time to refrain from embracing;\n"
    6: "⁶ A time to gain,\nAnd a time to lose;\nA time to keep,\nAnd a time to throw\
      \ away;\n"
    7: "⁷ A time to tear,\nAnd a time to sew;\nA time to keep silence,\nAnd a time\
      \ to speak;\n"
    8: "⁸ A time to love,\nAnd a time to hate;\nA time of war,\nAnd a time of peace.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ What profit has the worker from that in which he labors? '
    10: '¹⁰ I have seen the God-given task with which the sons of men are to be occupied. '
    11: "¹¹ He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity\
      \ in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from\
      \ beginning to end. \n"
    12: '¹² I know that nothing is better for them than to rejoice, and to do good
      in their lives, '
    13: "¹³ and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all\
      \ his labor—it is the gift of God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ I know that whatever God does,\nIt shall be forever.\nNothing can be added\
      \ to it,\nAnd nothing taken from it.\nGod does it, that men should fear before\
      \ Him.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ That which is has already been,\nAnd what is to be has already been;\n\
      And God requires an account of what is past. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover I saw under the sun:\nIn the place of judgment,\nWickedness was\
      \ there;\nAnd in the place of righteousness,\nIniquity was there. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ I said in my heart,\n“God shall judge the righteous and the wicked,\n\
      For there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God
      tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals.” '
    19: '¹⁹ For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing
      befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath;
      man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity. '
    20: '²⁰ All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. '
    21: '²¹ Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit
      of the animal, which goes down to the earth? '
    22: ²² So I perceived that nothing is better than that a man should rejoice in
      his own works, for that is his heritage. For who can bring him to see what will
      happen after him?
  4:
    1: "¹ Then I returned and considered all the oppression that is done under the\
      \ sun:\nAnd look! The tears of the oppressed,\nBut they have no comforter—\n\
      On the side of their oppressors there is power,\nBut they have no comforter.\n"
    2: "² Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead,\nMore than the living\
      \ who are still alive.\n"
    3: "³ Yet, better than both is he who has never existed,\nWho has not seen the\
      \ evil work that is done under the sun. \n"
    4: "⁴ Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by\
      \ his neighbor. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind. \n"
    5: "⁵ The fool folds his hands\nAnd consumes his own flesh.\n"
    6: "⁶ Better a handful with quietness\nThan both hands full, together with toil\
      \ and grasping for the wind. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun: \n"
    8: "⁸ There is one alone, without companion:\nHe has neither son nor brother.\n\
      Yet there is no end to all his labors,\nNor is his eye satisfied with riches.\n\
      But he never asks,\n“For whom do I toil and deprive myself of good?”\nThis also\
      \ is vanity and a grave misfortune. \n"
    9: "⁹ Two are better than one,\nBecause they have a good reward for their labor.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For if they fall, one will lift up his companion.\nBut woe to him who\
      \ is alone when he falls,\nFor he has no one to help him up.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm;\nBut how can one\
      \ be warm alone?\n"
    12: "¹² Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him.\nAnd\
      \ a threefold cord is not quickly broken. \n"
    13: "¹³ Better a poor and wise youth\nThan an old and foolish king who will be\
      \ admonished no more.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For he comes out of prison to be king,\nAlthough he was born poor in his\
      \ kingdom.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I saw all the living who walk under the sun;\nThey were with the second\
      \ youth who stands in his place.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ There was no end of all the people over whom he was made king;\nYet those\
      \ who come afterward will not rejoice in him.\nSurely this also is vanity and\
      \ grasping for the wind."
  5:
    1: "¹ Walk prudently when you go to the house of God; and draw near to hear rather\
      \ than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Do not be rash with your mouth,\nAnd let not your heart utter anything hastily\
      \ before God.\nFor God is in heaven, and you on earth;\nTherefore let your words\
      \ be few.\n"
    3: "³ For a dream comes through much activity,\nAnd a fool’s voice is known by\
      \ his many words. \n"
    4: "⁴ When you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it;\nFor He has no pleasure\
      \ in fools.\nPay what you have vowed—\n"
    5: "⁵ Better not to vow than to vow and not pay. \n"
    6: '⁶ Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, nor say before the messenger
      of God that it was an error. Why should God be angry at your excuse and destroy
      the work of your hands? '
    7: "⁷ For in the multitude of dreams and many words there is also vanity. But\
      \ fear God. \n"
    8: "⁸ If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice\
      \ and righteousness in a province, do not marvel at the matter; for high official\
      \ watches over high official, and higher officials are over them. \n"
    9: "⁹ Moreover the profit of the land is for all; even the king is served from\
      \ the field. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver;\nNor he who loves\
      \ abundance, with increase.\nThis also is vanity. \n"
    11: "¹¹ When goods increase,\nThey increase who eat them;\nSo what profit have\
      \ the owners\nExcept to see them with their eyes? \n"
    12: "¹² The sleep of a laboring man is sweet,\nWhether he eats little or much;\n\
      But the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep. \n"
    13: "¹³ There is a severe evil which I have seen under the sun:\nRiches kept for\
      \ their owner to his hurt.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ But those riches perish through misfortune;\nWhen he begets a son, there\
      \ is nothing in his hand.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ As he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return,\nTo go as he\
      \ came;\nAnd he shall take nothing from his labor\nWhich he may carry away in\
      \ his hand. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ And this also is a severe evil—\nJust exactly as he came, so shall he\
      \ go.\nAnd what profit has he who has labored for the wind?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ All his days he also eats in darkness,\nAnd he has much sorrow and sickness\
      \ and anger. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Here is what I have seen: It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink,
      and to enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the
      days of his life which God gives him; for it is his heritage. '
    19: '¹⁹ As for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him
      power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor—this is
      the gift of God. '
    20: ²⁰ For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps
      him busy with the joy of his heart.
  6:
    1: '¹ There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among
      men: '
    2: "² A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks\
      \ nothing for himself of all he desires; yet God does not give him power to\
      \ eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This is vanity, and it is an evil\
      \ affliction. \n"
    3: '³ If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days
      of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed
      he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he— '
    4: '⁴ for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered
      with darkness. '
    5: '⁵ Though it has not seen the sun or known anything, this has more rest than
      that man, '
    6: "⁶ even if he lives a thousand years twice—but has not seen goodness. Do not\
      \ all go to one place? \n"
    7: "⁷ All the labor of man is for his mouth,\nAnd yet the soul is not satisfied.\n"
    8: "⁸ For what more has the wise man than the fool?\nWhat does the poor man have,\n\
      Who knows how to walk before the living?\n"
    9: "⁹ Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire.\nThis also\
      \ is vanity and grasping for the wind. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Whatever one is, he has been named already,\nFor it is known that he is\
      \ man;\nAnd he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Since there are many things that increase vanity,\nHow is man the better?\
      \ \n"
    12: ¹² For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life
      which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him
      under the sun?
  7:
    1: "¹ A good name is better than precious ointment,\nAnd the day of death than\
      \ the day of one’s birth;\n"
    2: "² Better to go to the house of mourning\nThan to go to the house of feasting,\n\
      For that is the end of all men;\nAnd the living will take it to heart.\n"
    3: "³ Sorrow is better than laughter,\nFor by a sad countenance the heart is made\
      \ better.\n"
    4: "⁴ The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,\nBut the heart of fools\
      \ is in the house of mirth. \n"
    5: "⁵ It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise\nThan for a man to hear the\
      \ song of fools.\n"
    6: "⁶ For like the crackling of thorns under a pot,\nSo is the laughter of the\
      \ fool.\nThis also is vanity.\n"
    7: "⁷ Surely oppression destroys a wise man’s reason,\nAnd a bribe debases the\
      \ heart. \n"
    8: "⁸ The end of a thing is better than its beginning;\nThe patient in spirit\
      \ is better than the proud in spirit.\n"
    9: "⁹ Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry,\nFor anger rests in the bosom\
      \ of fools.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not say,\n“Why were the former days better than these?”\nFor you do\
      \ not inquire wisely concerning this. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Wisdom is good with an inheritance,\nAnd profitable to those who see the\
      \ sun.\n"
    12: "¹² For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense,\nBut the excellence of\
      \ knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who have it. \n"
    13: "¹³ Consider the work of God;\nFor who can make straight what He has made\
      \ crooked?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ In the day of prosperity be joyful,\nBut in the day of adversity consider:\n\
      Surely God has appointed the one as well as the other,\nSo that man can find\
      \ out nothing that will come after him. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ I have seen everything in my days of vanity:\nThere is a just man who\
      \ perishes in his righteousness,\nAnd there is a wicked man who prolongs life\
      \ in his wickedness. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Do not be overly righteous,\nNor be overly wise:\nWhy should you destroy\
      \ yourself?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Do not be overly wicked,\nNor be foolish:\nWhy should you die before your\
      \ time?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ It is good that you grasp this,\nAnd also not remove your hand from the\
      \ other;\nFor he who fears God will escape them all. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Wisdom strengthens the wise\nMore than ten rulers of the city. \n"
    20: "²⁰ For there is not a just man on earth who does good\nAnd does not sin.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Also do not take to heart everything people say,\nLest you hear your servant\
      \ cursing you.\n"
    22: "²² For many times, also, your own heart has known\nThat even you have cursed\
      \ others. \n"
    23: "²³ All this I have proved by wisdom.\nI said, “I will be wise”;\nBut it was\
      \ far from me.\n"
    24: "²⁴ As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep,\nWho can find it out?\n"
    25: "²⁵ I applied my heart to know,\nTo search and seek out wisdom and the reason\
      \ of things,\nTo know the wickedness of folly,\nEven of foolishness and madness.\n"
    26: "²⁶ And I find more bitter than death\nThe woman whose heart is snares and\
      \ nets,\nWhose hands are fetters.\nHe who pleases God shall escape from her,\n\
      But the sinner shall be trapped by her. \n"
    27: "²⁷ “Here is what I have found,” says the Preacher,\n“Adding one thing to\
      \ the other to find out the reason,\n"
    28: "²⁸ Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find:\nOne man among a thousand\
      \ I have found,\nBut a woman among all these I have not found.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Truly, this only I have found:\nThat God made man upright,\nBut they have\
      \ sought out many schemes.”"
  8:
    1: "¹ Who is like a wise man?\nAnd who knows the interpretation of a thing?\n\
      A man’s wisdom makes his face shine,\nAnd the sternness of his face is changed.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² I say, “Keep the king’s commandment for the sake of your oath to God. '
    3: "³ Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil\
      \ thing, for he does whatever pleases him.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Where the word of a king is, there is power;\nAnd who may say to him, “What\
      \ are you doing?”\n"
    5: "⁵ He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful;\nAnd a wise man’s\
      \ heart discerns both time and judgment,\n"
    6: "⁶ Because for every matter there is a time and judgment,\nThough the misery\
      \ of man increases greatly.\n"
    7: "⁷ For he does not know what will happen;\nSo who can tell him when it will\
      \ occur?\n"
    8: "⁸ No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit,\nAnd no one has power\
      \ in the day of death.\nThere is no release from that war,\nAnd wickedness will\
      \ not deliver those who are given to it. \n"
    9: "⁹ All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under\
      \ the sun: There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of
      holiness, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also
      is vanity. '
    11: '¹¹ Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore
      the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. '
    12: '¹² Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged,
      yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before
      Him. '
    13: "¹³ But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong his days,\
      \ which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just men to whom\
      \ it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men\
      \ to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this\
      \ also is vanity. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun\
      \ than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor\
      \ all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is
      done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night, '
    17: ¹⁷ then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that
      is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover it, yet he will not
      find it; moreover, though a wise man attempts to know it, he will not be able
      to find it.
  9:
    1: '¹ For I considered all this in my heart, so that I could declare it all: that
      the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God. People know
      neither love nor hatred by anything they see before them. '
    2: "² All things come alike to all:\nOne event happens to the righteous and the\
      \ wicked;\nTo the good, the clean, and the unclean;\nTo him who sacrifices and\
      \ him who does not sacrifice.\nAs is the good, so is the sinner;\nHe who takes\
      \ an oath as he who fears an oath. \n"
    3: '³ This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one thing happens
      to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; madness is in
      their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead. '
    4: "⁴ But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living\
      \ dog is better than a dead lion. \n"
    5: "⁵ For the living know that they will die;\nBut the dead know nothing,\nAnd\
      \ they have no more reward,\nFor the memory of them is forgotten.\n"
    6: "⁶ Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished;\nNevermore\
      \ will they have a share\nIn anything done under the sun. \n"
    7: "⁷ Go, eat your bread with joy,\nAnd drink your wine with a merry heart;\n\
      For God has already accepted your works.\n"
    8: "⁸ Let your garments always be white,\nAnd let your head lack no oil. \n"
    9: "⁹ Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life\
      \ which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; for that is\
      \ your portion in life, and in the labor which you perform under the sun. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no\
      \ work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going. \n"
    11: "¹¹ I returned and saw under the sun that—\nThe race is not to the swift,\n\
      Nor the battle to the strong,\nNor bread to the wise,\nNor riches to men of\
      \ understanding,\nNor favor to men of skill;\nBut time and chance happen to\
      \ them all.\n"
    12: "¹² For man also does not know his time:\nLike fish taken in a cruel net,\n\
      Like birds caught in a snare,\nSo the sons of men are snared in an evil time,\n\
      When it falls suddenly upon them. \n"
    13: '¹³ This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it seemed great to me: '
    14: '¹⁴ There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against
      it, besieged it, and built great snares around it. '
    15: "¹⁵ Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered\
      \ the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then I said:\n“Wisdom is better than strength.\nNevertheless the poor\
      \ man’s wisdom is despised,\nAnd his words are not heard.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard\nRather than the shout\
      \ of a ruler of fools.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Wisdom is better than weapons of war;\nBut one sinner destroys much good.”"
  10:
    1: "¹ Dead flies putrefy the perfumer’s ointment,\nAnd cause it to give off a\
      \ foul odor;\nSo does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and honor.\n"
    2: "² A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,\nBut a fool’s heart at his left.\n"
    3: "³ Even when a fool walks along the way,\nHe lacks wisdom,\nAnd he shows everyone\
      \ that he is a fool.\n"
    4: "⁴ If the spirit of the ruler rises against you,\nDo not leave your post;\n\
      For conciliation pacifies great offenses. \n"
    5: "⁵ There is an evil I have seen under the sun,\nAs an error proceeding from\
      \ the ruler:\n"
    6: "⁶ Folly is set in great dignity,\nWhile the rich sit in a lowly place.\n"
    7: "⁷ I have seen servants on horses,\nWhile princes walk on the ground like servants.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ He who digs a pit will fall into it,\nAnd whoever breaks through a wall\
      \ will be bitten by a serpent.\n"
    9: "⁹ He who quarries stones may be hurt by them,\nAnd he who splits wood may\
      \ be endangered by it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ If the ax is dull,\nAnd one does not sharpen the edge,\nThen he must use\
      \ more strength;\nBut wisdom brings success. \n"
    11: "¹¹ A serpent may bite when it is not charmed;\nThe babbler is no different.\n"
    12: "¹² The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious,\nBut the lips of a fool\
      \ shall swallow him up;\n"
    13: "¹³ The words of his mouth begin with foolishness,\nAnd the end of his talk\
      \ is raving madness.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ A fool also multiplies words.\nNo man knows what is to be;\nWho can tell\
      \ him what will be after him?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The labor of fools wearies them,\nFor they do not even know how to go\
      \ to the city! \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,\nAnd your princes feast\
      \ in the morning!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles,\nAnd your\
      \ princes feast at the proper time—\nFor strength and not for drunkenness!\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Because of laziness the building decays,\nAnd through idleness of hands\
      \ the house leaks.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A feast is made for laughter,\nAnd wine makes merry;\nBut money answers\
      \ everything. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Do not curse the king, even in your thought;\nDo not curse the rich, even\
      \ in your bedroom;\nFor a bird of the air may carry your voice,\nAnd a bird\
      \ in flight may tell the matter."
  11:
    1: "¹ Cast your bread upon the waters,\nFor you will find it after many days.\n"
    2: "² Give a serving to seven, and also to eight,\nFor you do not know what evil\
      \ will be on the earth. \n"
    3: "³ If the clouds are full of rain,\nThey empty themselves upon the earth;\n\
      And if a tree falls to the south or the north,\nIn the place where the tree\
      \ falls, there it shall lie.\n"
    4: "⁴ He who observes the wind will not sow,\nAnd he who regards the clouds will\
      \ not reap. \n"
    5: "⁵ As you do not know what is the way of the wind,\nOr how the bones grow in\
      \ the womb of her who is with child,\nSo you do not know the works of God who\
      \ makes everything.\n"
    6: "⁶ In the morning sow your seed,\nAnd in the evening do not withhold your hand;\n\
      For you do not know which will prosper,\nEither this or that,\nOr whether both\
      \ alike will be good. \n"
    7: "⁷ Truly the light is sweet,\nAnd it is pleasant for the eyes to behold the\
      \ sun;\n"
    8: "⁸ But if a man lives many years\nAnd rejoices in them all,\nYet let him remember\
      \ the days of darkness,\nFor they will be many.\nAll that is coming is vanity.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Rejoice, O young man, in your youth,\nAnd let your heart cheer you in the\
      \ days of your youth;\nWalk in the ways of your heart,\nAnd in the sight of\
      \ your eyes;\nBut know that for all these\nGod will bring you into judgment.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore remove sorrow from your heart,\nAnd put away evil from your\
      \ flesh,\nFor childhood and youth are vanity."
  12:
    1: "¹ Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth,\nBefore the difficult\
      \ days come,\nAnd the years draw near when you say,\n“I have no pleasure in\
      \ them”:\n"
    2: "² While the sun and the light,\nThe moon and the stars,\nAre not darkened,\n\
      And the clouds do not return after the rain;\n"
    3: "³ In the day when the keepers of the house tremble,\nAnd the strong men bow\
      \ down;\nWhen the grinders cease because they are few,\nAnd those that look\
      \ through the windows grow dim;\n"
    4: "⁴ When the doors are shut in the streets,\nAnd the sound of grinding is low;\n\
      When one rises up at the sound of a bird,\nAnd all the daughters of music are\
      \ brought low.\n"
    5: "⁵ Also they are afraid of height,\nAnd of terrors in the way;\nWhen the almond\
      \ tree blossoms,\nThe grasshopper is a burden,\nAnd desire fails.\nFor man goes\
      \ to his eternal home,\nAnd the mourners go about the streets. \n"
    6: "⁶ Remember your Creator before the silver cord is loosed,\nOr the golden bowl\
      \ is broken,\nOr the pitcher shattered at the fountain,\nOr the wheel broken\
      \ at the well.\n"
    7: "⁷ Then the dust will return to the earth as it was,\nAnd the spirit will return\
      \ to God who gave it. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher,\n“All is vanity.” \n"
    9: '⁹ And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people
      knowledge; yes, he pondered and sought out and set in order many proverbs. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Preacher sought to find acceptable words; and what was written was
      upright—words of truth. '
    11: '¹¹ The words of the wise are like goads, and the words of scholars are like
      well-driven nails, given by one Shepherd. '
    12: "¹² And further, my son, be admonished by these. Of making many books there\
      \ is no end, and much study is wearisome to the flesh. \n"
    13: "¹³ Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:\nFear God and keep His\
      \ commandments,\nFor this is man’s all.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For God will bring every work into judgment,\nIncluding every secret thing,\n\
      Whether good or evil."
