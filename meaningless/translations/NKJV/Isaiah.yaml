Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and\
      \ Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth!\nFor the Lord has spoken:\n“I have\
      \ nourished and brought up children,\nAnd they have rebelled against Me;\n"
    3: "³ The ox knows its owner\nAnd the donkey its master’s crib;\nBut Israel does\
      \ not know,\nMy people do not consider.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Alas, sinful nation,\nA people laden with iniquity,\nA brood of evildoers,\n\
      Children who are corrupters!\nThey have forsaken the Lord,\nThey have provoked\
      \ to anger\nThe Holy One of Israel,\nThey have turned away backward. \n"
    5: "⁵ Why should you be stricken again?\nYou will revolt more and more.\nThe whole\
      \ head is sick,\nAnd the whole heart faints.\n"
    6: "⁶ From the sole of the foot even to the head,\nThere is no soundness in it,\n\
      But wounds and bruises and putrefying sores;\nThey have not been closed or bound\
      \ up,\nOr soothed with ointment. \n"
    7: "⁷ Your country is desolate,\nYour cities are burned with fire;\nStrangers\
      \ devour your land in your presence;\nAnd it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.\n"
    8: "⁸ So the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard,\nAs a hut in a\
      \ garden of cucumbers,\nAs a besieged city.\n"
    9: "⁹ Unless the Lord of hosts\nHad left to us a very small remnant,\nWe would\
      \ have become like Sodom,\nWe would have been made like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord,\nYou rulers of Sodom;\nGive ear to the law\
      \ of our God,\nYou people of Gomorrah:\n"
    11: "¹¹ “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?”\nSays the\
      \ Lord.\n“I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams\nAnd the fat of fed cattle.\n\
      I do not delight in the blood of bulls,\nOr of lambs or goats. \n"
    12: "¹² “When you come to appear before Me,\nWho has required this from your hand,\n\
      To trample My courts?\n"
    13: "¹³ Bring no more futile sacrifices;\nIncense is an abomination to Me.\nThe\
      \ New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies—\nI cannot endure iniquity\
      \ and the sacred meeting.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your New Moons and your appointed feasts\nMy soul hates;\nThey are a trouble\
      \ to Me,\nI am weary of bearing them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ When you spread out your hands,\nI will hide My eyes from you;\nEven though\
      \ you make many prayers,\nI will not hear.\nYour hands are full of blood. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean;\nPut away the evil of your doings\
      \ from before My eyes.\nCease to do evil,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Learn to do good;\nSeek justice,\nRebuke the oppressor;\nDefend the fatherless,\n\
      Plead for the widow. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Come now, and let us reason together,”\nSays the Lord,\n“Though your\
      \ sins are like scarlet,\nThey shall be as white as snow;\nThough they are red\
      \ like crimson,\nThey shall be as wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you are willing and obedient,\nYou shall eat the good of the land;\n"
    20: "²⁰ But if you refuse and rebel,\nYou shall be devoured by the sword”;\nFor\
      \ the mouth of the Lord has spoken. \n"
    21: "²¹ How the faithful city has become a harlot!\nIt was full of justice;\n\
      Righteousness lodged in it,\nBut now murderers.\n"
    22: "²² Your silver has become dross,\nYour wine mixed with water.\n"
    23: "²³ Your princes are rebellious,\nAnd companions of thieves;\nEveryone loves\
      \ bribes,\nAnd follows after rewards.\nThey do not defend the fatherless,\n\
      Nor does the cause of the widow come before them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore the Lord says,\nThe Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel,\n\
      “Ah, I will rid Myself of My adversaries,\nAnd take vengeance on My enemies.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will turn My hand against you,\nAnd thoroughly purge away your dross,\n\
      And take away all your alloy.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I will restore your judges as at the first,\nAnd your counselors as at\
      \ the beginning.\nAfterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the\
      \ faithful city.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion shall be redeemed with justice,\nAnd her penitents with righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ The destruction of transgressors and of sinners shall be together,\nAnd\
      \ those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.\n"
    29: "²⁹ For they shall be ashamed of the terebinth trees\nWhich you have desired;\n\
      And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens\nWhich you have chosen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades,\nAnd as a garden that\
      \ has no water.\n"
    31: "³¹ The strong shall be as tinder,\nAnd the work of it as a spark;\nBoth will\
      \ burn together,\nAnd no one shall quench them."
  2:
    1: "¹ The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Now it shall come to pass in the latter days\nThat the mountain of the Lord’s\
      \ house\nShall be established on the top of the mountains,\nAnd shall be exalted\
      \ above the hills;\nAnd all nations shall flow to it.\n"
    3: "³ Many people shall come and say,\n“Come, and let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\nTo the house of the God of Jacob;\nHe will teach us His ways,\n\
      And we shall walk in His paths.”\nFor out of Zion shall go forth the law,\n\
      And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ He shall judge between the nations,\nAnd rebuke many people;\nThey shall\
      \ beat their swords into plowshares,\nAnd their spears into pruning hooks;\n\
      Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,\nNeither shall they learn war\
      \ anymore. \n"
    5: "⁵ O house of Jacob, come and let us walk\nIn the light of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob,\nBecause they are\
      \ filled with eastern ways;\nThey are soothsayers like the Philistines,\nAnd\
      \ they are pleased with the children of foreigners.\n"
    7: "⁷ Their land is also full of silver and gold,\nAnd there is no end to their\
      \ treasures;\nTheir land is also full of horses,\nAnd there is no end to their\
      \ chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land is also full of idols;\nThey worship the work of their own hands,\n\
      That which their own fingers have made.\n"
    9: "⁹ People bow down,\nAnd each man humbles himself;\nTherefore do not forgive\
      \ them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust,\nFrom the terror of the Lord\n\
      And the glory of His majesty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The lofty looks of man shall be humbled,\nThe haughtiness of men shall\
      \ be bowed down,\nAnd the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. \n"
    12: "¹² For the day of the Lord of hosts\nShall come upon everything proud and\
      \ lofty,\nUpon everything lifted up—\nAnd it shall be brought low—\n"
    13: "¹³ Upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up,\nAnd upon\
      \ all the oaks of Bashan;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Upon all the high mountains,\nAnd upon all the hills that are lifted up;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Upon every high tower,\nAnd upon every fortified wall;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Upon all the ships of Tarshish,\nAnd upon all the beautiful sloops.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,\nAnd the haughtiness of men\
      \ shall be brought low;\nThe Lord alone will be exalted in that day,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But the idols He shall utterly abolish. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ They shall go into the holes of the rocks,\nAnd into the caves of the\
      \ earth,\nFrom the terror of the Lord\nAnd the glory of His majesty,\nWhen He\
      \ arises to shake the earth mightily. \n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver\nAnd his idols of\
      \ gold,\nWhich they made, each for himself to worship,\nTo the moles and bats,\n"
    21: "²¹ To go into the clefts of the rocks,\nAnd into the crags of the rugged\
      \ rocks,\nFrom the terror of the Lord\nAnd the glory of His majesty,\nWhen He\
      \ arises to shake the earth mightily. \n"
    22: "²² Sever yourselves from such a man,\nWhose breath is in his nostrils;\n\
      For of what account is he?"
  3:
    1: "¹ For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts,\nTakes away from Jerusalem and\
      \ from Judah\nThe stock and the store,\nThe whole supply of bread and the whole\
      \ supply of water;\n"
    2: "² The mighty man and the man of war,\nThe judge and the prophet,\nAnd the\
      \ diviner and the elder;\n"
    3: "³ The captain of fifty and the honorable man,\nThe counselor and the skillful\
      \ artisan,\nAnd the expert enchanter. \n"
    4: "⁴ “I will give children to be their princes,\nAnd babes shall rule over them.\n"
    5: "⁵ The people will be oppressed,\nEvery one by another and every one by his\
      \ neighbor;\nThe child will be insolent toward the elder,\nAnd the base toward\
      \ the honorable.” \n"
    6: "⁶ When a man takes hold of his brother\nIn the house of his father, saying,\n\
      “You have clothing;\nYou be our ruler,\nAnd let these ruins be under your power,”\n"
    7: "⁷ In that day he will protest, saying,\n“I cannot cure your ills,\nFor in\
      \ my house is neither food nor clothing;\nDo not make me a ruler of the people.”\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ For Jerusalem stumbled,\nAnd Judah is fallen,\nBecause their tongue and\
      \ their doings\nAre against the Lord,\nTo provoke the eyes of His glory.\n"
    9: "⁹ The look on their countenance witnesses against them,\nAnd they declare\
      \ their sin as Sodom;\nThey do not hide it.\nWoe to their soul!\nFor they have\
      \ brought evil upon themselves. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them,\nFor they shall\
      \ eat the fruit of their doings.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,\nFor the reward of his hands\
      \ shall be given him.\n"
    12: "¹² As for My people, children are their oppressors,\nAnd women rule over\
      \ them.\nO My people! Those who lead you cause you to err,\nAnd destroy the\
      \ way of your paths.” \n"
    13: "¹³ The Lord stands up to plead,\nAnd stands to judge the people.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord will enter into judgment\nWith the elders of His people\nAnd\
      \ His princes:\n“For you have eaten up the vineyard;\nThe plunder of the poor\
      \ is in your houses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ What do you mean by crushing My people\nAnd grinding the faces of the\
      \ poor?”\nSays the Lord God of hosts. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover the Lord says:\n“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,\n\
      And walk with outstretched necks\nAnd wanton eyes,\nWalking and mincing as they\
      \ go,\nMaking a jingling with their feet,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore the Lord will strike with a scab\nThe crown of the head of the\
      \ daughters of Zion,\nAnd the Lord will uncover their secret parts.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ In that day the Lord will take away the finery:\nThe jingling anklets,\
      \ the scarves, and the crescents;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The pendants, the bracelets, and the veils;\n"
    20: "²⁰ The headdresses, the leg ornaments, and the headbands;\nThe perfume boxes,\
      \ the charms,\n"
    21: "²¹     and the rings;\nThe nose jewels,\n"
    22: "²²     the festal apparel, and the mantles;\nThe outer garments, the purses,\n"
    23: "²³     and the mirrors;\nThe fine linen, the turbans, and the robes. \n"
    24: "²⁴ And so it shall be:\nInstead of a sweet smell there will be a stench;\n\
      Instead of a sash, a rope;\nInstead of well-set hair, baldness;\nInstead of\
      \ a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth;\nAnd branding instead of beauty.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your men shall fall by the sword,\nAnd your mighty in the war. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Her gates shall lament and mourn,\nAnd she being desolate shall sit on\
      \ the ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying,\n“We will\
      \ eat our own food and wear our own apparel;\nOnly let us be called by your\
      \ name,\nTo take away our reproach.” \n"
    2: "² In that day the Branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious;\nAnd\
      \ the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and appealing\nFor those of Israel\
      \ who have escaped. \n"
    3: '³ And it shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem
      will be called holy—everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purged
      the blood of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the
      spirit of burning, '
    5: '⁵ then the Lord will create above every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and
      above her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming
      fire by night. For over all the glory there will be a covering. '
    6: ⁶ And there will be a tabernacle for shade in the daytime from the heat, for
      a place of refuge, and for a shelter from storm and rain.
  5:
    1: "¹ Now let me sing to my Well-beloved\nA song of my Beloved regarding His vineyard:\
      \ \nMy Well-beloved has a vineyard\nOn a very fruitful hill.\n"
    2: "² He dug it up and cleared out its stones,\nAnd planted it with the choicest\
      \ vine.\nHe built a tower in its midst,\nAnd also made a winepress in it;\n\
      So He expected it to bring forth good grapes,\nBut it brought forth wild grapes.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,\nJudge, please, between\
      \ Me and My vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What more could have been done to My vineyard\nThat I have not done in it?\n\
      Why then, when I expected it to bring forth good grapes,\nDid it bring forth\
      \ wild grapes?\n"
    5: "⁵ And now, please let Me tell you what I will do to My vineyard:\nI will take\
      \ away its hedge, and it shall be burned;\nAnd break down its wall, and it shall\
      \ be trampled down.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will lay it waste;\nIt shall not be pruned or dug,\nBut there shall come\
      \ up briers and thorns.\nI will also command the clouds\nThat they rain no rain\
      \ on it.” \n"
    7: "⁷ For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel,\nAnd the men\
      \ of Judah are His pleasant plant.\nHe looked for justice, but behold, oppression;\n\
      For righteousness, but behold, a cry for help. \n"
    8: "⁸ Woe to those who join house to house;\nThey add field to field,\nTill there\
      \ is no place\nWhere they may dwell alone in the midst of the land!\n"
    9: "⁹ In my hearing the Lord of hosts said,\n“Truly, many houses shall be desolate,\n\
      Great and beautiful ones, without inhabitant.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,\nAnd a homer of seed shall\
      \ yield one ephah.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to those who rise early in the morning,\nThat they may follow intoxicating\
      \ drink;\nWho continue until night, till wine inflames them!\n"
    12: "¹² The harp and the strings,\nThe tambourine and flute,\nAnd wine are in\
      \ their feasts;\nBut they do not regard the work of the Lord,\nNor consider\
      \ the operation of His hands. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore my people have gone into captivity,\nBecause they have no knowledge;\n\
      Their honorable men are famished,\nAnd their multitude dried up with thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself\nAnd opened its mouth beyond measure;\n\
      Their glory and their multitude and their pomp,\nAnd he who is jubilant, shall\
      \ descend into it.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ People shall be brought down,\nEach man shall be humbled,\nAnd the eyes\
      \ of the lofty shall be humbled.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment,\nAnd God who is holy\
      \ shall be hallowed in righteousness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then the lambs shall feed in their pasture,\nAnd in the waste places of\
      \ the fat ones strangers shall eat. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity,\nAnd sin as if with\
      \ a cart rope;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ That say, “Let Him make speed and hasten His work,\nThat we may see it;\n\
      And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,\nThat we may\
      \ know it.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;\nWho put darkness for\
      \ light, and light for darkness;\nWho put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,\nAnd prudent in their own\
      \ sight! \n"
    22: "²² Woe to men mighty at drinking wine,\nWoe to men valiant for mixing intoxicating\
      \ drink,\n"
    23: "²³ Who justify the wicked for a bribe,\nAnd take away justice from the righteous\
      \ man! \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, as the fire devours the stubble,\nAnd the flame consumes the\
      \ chaff,\nSo their root will be as rottenness,\nAnd their blossom will ascend\
      \ like dust;\nBecause they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts,\nAnd\
      \ despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Therefore the anger of the Lord is aroused against His people;\nHe has\
      \ stretched out His hand against them\nAnd stricken them,\nAnd the hills trembled.\n\
      Their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. \nFor all this His\
      \ anger is not turned away,\nBut His hand is stretched out still. \n"
    26: "²⁶ He will lift up a banner to the nations from afar,\nAnd will whistle to\
      \ them from the end of the earth;\nSurely they shall come with speed, swiftly.\n"
    27: "²⁷ No one will be weary or stumble among them,\nNo one will slumber or sleep;\n\
      Nor will the belt on their loins be loosed,\nNor the strap of their sandals\
      \ be broken;\n"
    28: "²⁸ Whose arrows are sharp,\nAnd all their bows bent;\nTheir horses’ hooves\
      \ will seem like flint,\nAnd their wheels like a whirlwind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Their roaring will be like a lion,\nThey will roar like young lions;\n\
      Yes, they will roar\nAnd lay hold of the prey;\nThey will carry it away safely,\n\
      And no one will deliver.\n"
    30: "³⁰ In that day they will roar against them\nLike the roaring of the sea.\n\
      And if one looks to the land,\nBehold, darkness and sorrow;\nAnd the light is\
      \ darkened by the clouds."
  6:
    1: '¹ In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high
      and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. '
    2: '² Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his
      face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. '
    3: "³ And one cried to another and said:\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;\n\
      The whole earth is full of His glory!” \n"
    4: "⁴ And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out,\
      \ and the house was filled with smoke. \n"
    5: "⁵ So I said:\n“Woe is me, for I am undone!\nBecause I am a man of unclean\
      \ lips,\nAnd I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;\nFor my eyes\
      \ have seen the King,\nThe Lord of hosts.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which
      he had taken with the tongs from the altar. '
    7: "⁷ And he touched my mouth with it, and said:\n“Behold, this has touched your\
      \ lips;\nYour iniquity is taken away,\nAnd your sin purged.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:\n“Whom shall I send,\nAnd who\
      \ will go for Us?”\nThen I said, “Here am I! Send me.” \n"
    9: "⁹ And He said, “Go, and tell this people:\n‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;\n\
      Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Make the heart of this people dull,\nAnd their ears heavy,\nAnd shut\
      \ their eyes;\nLest they see with their eyes,\nAnd hear with their ears,\nAnd\
      \ understand with their heart,\nAnd return and be healed.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “Lord, how long?”\nAnd He answered:\n“Until the cities are\
      \ laid waste and without inhabitant,\nThe houses are without a man,\nThe land\
      \ is utterly desolate,\n"
    12: "¹² The Lord has removed men far away,\nAnd the forsaken places are many in\
      \ the midst of the land.\n"
    13: "¹³ But yet a tenth will be in it,\nAnd will return and be for consuming,\n\
      As a terebinth tree or as an oak,\nWhose stump remains when it is cut down.\n\
      So the holy seed shall be its stump.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah,
      king of Judah, that Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king
      of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but could not prevail
      against it. '
    2: "² And it was told to the house of David, saying, “Syria’s forces are deployed\
      \ in Ephraim.” So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees\
      \ of the woods are moved with the wind. \n"
    3: '³ Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub
      your son, at the end of the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to
      the Fuller’s Field, '
    4: '⁴ and say to him: ‘Take heed, and be quiet; do not fear or be fainthearted
      for these two stubs of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and
      Syria, and the son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against
      you, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and let us make a gap in its
      wall for ourselves, and set a king over them, the son of Tabel”— '
    7: "⁷ thus says the Lord God:\n“It shall not stand,\nNor shall it come to pass.\n"
    8: "⁸ For the head of Syria is Damascus,\nAnd the head of Damascus is Rezin.\n\
      Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken,\nSo that it will not be a people.\n"
    9: "⁹ The head of Ephraim is Samaria,\nAnd the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son.\n\
      If you will not believe,\nSurely you shall not be established.” ’ ” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, '
    11: "¹¹ “Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; ask it either in the\
      \ depth or in the height above.” \n"
    12: "¹² But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I test the Lord!” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you

    15: "¹⁵ Thus says the Lord God of hosts:\n“Go, proceed to this steward,\nTo Shebna,\
      \ who is over the house, and say:\n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘What have you here, and whom have you here,\nThat you have hewn a sepulcher\
      \ here,\nAs he who hews himself a sepulcher on high,\nWho carves a tomb for\
      \ himself in a rock?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Indeed, the Lord will throw you away violently,\nO mighty man,\nAnd will\
      \ surely seize you.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ He will surely turn violently and toss you like a ball\nInto a large country;\n\
      There you shall die, and there your glorious chariots\nShall be the shame of\
      \ your master’s house.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ So I will drive you out of your office,\nAnd from your position he will\

    21: "²¹ I will clothe him with your robe\nAnd strengthen him with your belt;\n\
      I will commit your responsibility into his hand.\nHe shall be a father to the\
      \ inhabitants of Jerusalem\nAnd to the house of Judah.\n"
    22: "²² The key of the house of David\nI will lay on his shoulder;\nSo he shall\

    23: "²³ I will fasten him as a peg in a secure place,\nAnd he will become a glorious\

    24: '²⁴ ‘They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring
      and the posterity, all vessels of small quantity, from the cups to all the pitchers. '
    25: ²⁵ In that day,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘the peg that is fastened in the
      secure place will be removed and be cut down and fall, and the burden that was
      on it will be cut off; for the Lord has spoken.’ ”
  23:
    1: "¹ The burden against Tyre.\nWail, you ships of Tarshish!\nFor it is laid waste,\n\
      So that there is no house, no harbor;\nFrom the land of Cyprus it is revealed\
      \ to them. \n"
    2: "² Be still, you inhabitants of the coastland,\nYou merchants of Sidon,\nWhom\
      \ those who cross the sea have filled.\n"
    3: "³ And on great waters the grain of Shihor,\nThe harvest of the River, is her\

    4: "⁴ Be ashamed, O Sidon;\nFor the sea has spoken,\nThe strength of the sea,\

    6: "⁶ Cross over to Tarshish;\nWail, you inhabitants of the coastland!\n"
    7: "⁷ Is this your joyous city,\nWhose antiquity is from ancient days,\nWhose\

    8: "⁸ Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,\nWhose merchants\
      \ are princes,\nWhose traders are the honorable of the earth?\n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord of hosts has purposed it,\nTo bring to dishonor the pride of all\
      \ glory,\nTo bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Overflow through your land like the River,\nO daughter of Tarshish;\n\
      There is no more strength.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He stretched out His hand over the sea,\nHe shook the kingdoms;\nThe Lord\

    12: "¹² And He said, “You will rejoice no more,\nO you oppressed virgin daughter\

    13: "¹³ Behold, the land of the Chaldeans,\nThis people which was not;\nAssyria\

      \ up its palaces,\nAnd brought it to ruin. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wail, you ships of Tarshish!\nFor your strength is laid waste. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Now it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy\
      \ years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will\

    16: "¹⁶ “Take a harp, go about the city,\nYou forgotten harlot;\nMake sweet melody,\

    17: '¹⁷ And it shall be, at the end of seventy years, that the Lord will deal
      with Tyre. She will return to her hire, and commit fornication with all the
      kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. '
    18: ¹⁸ Her gain and her pay will be set apart for the Lord; it will not be treasured
      nor laid up, for her gain will be for those who dwell before the Lord, to eat
      sufficiently, and for fine clothing.
  24:
    1: "¹ Behold, the Lord makes the earth empty and makes it waste,\nDistorts its\
      \ surface\nAnd scatters abroad its inhabitants.\n"
    2: "² And it shall be:\nAs with the people, so with the priest;\nAs with the servant,\

    3: "³ The land shall be entirely emptied and utterly plundered,\nFor the Lord\

    6: "⁶ Therefore the curse has devoured the earth,\nAnd those who dwell in it are\
      \ desolate.\nTherefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,\nAnd few men\
      \ are left. \n"
    7: "⁷ The new wine fails, the vine languishes,\nAll the merry-hearted sigh.\n"
    8: "⁸ The mirth of the tambourine ceases,\nThe noise of the jubilant ends,\nThe\
      \ joy of the harp ceases.\n"
    9: "⁹ They shall not drink wine with a song;\nStrong drink is bitter to those\

    17: "¹⁷ Fear and the pit and the snare\nAre upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.\n"

  25:
    1: "¹ O Lord, You are my God.\nI will exalt You,\nI will praise Your name,\nFor\
      \ You have done wonderful things;\nYour counsels of old are faithfulness and\

    2: "² For You have made a city a ruin,\nA fortified city a ruin,\nA palace of\

    3: "³ Therefore the strong people will glorify You;\nThe city of the terrible\

    4: "⁴ For You have been a strength to the poor,\nA strength to the needy in his\
      \ distress,\nA refuge from the storm,\nA shade from the heat;\nFor the blast\

    9: "⁹ And it will be said in that day:\n“Behold, this is our God;\nWe have waited\

      We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ For on this mountain the hand of the Lord will rest,\nAnd Moab shall be\

    11: "¹¹ And He will spread out His hands in their midst\nAs a swimmer reaches\

  26:
    1: "¹ In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:\n“We have a strong\

    10: "¹⁰ Let grace be shown to the wicked,\nYet he will not learn righteousness;\n\

      \ of the Lord.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Lord, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see.\nBut they will see\
      \ and be ashamed\nFor their envy of people;\nYes, the fire of Your enemies shall\
      \ devour them. \n"
    12: "¹² Lord, You will establish peace for us,\nFor You have also done all our\
      \ works in us.\n"
    13: "¹³ O Lord our God, masters besides You\nHave had dominion over us;\nBut by\
      \ You only we make mention of Your name.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They are dead, they will not live;\nThey are deceased, they will not rise.\n\
      Therefore You have punished and destroyed them,\nAnd made all their memory to\
      \ perish.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You have increased the nation, O Lord,\nYou have increased the nation;\n\
      You are glorified;\nYou have expanded all the borders of the land. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Lord, in trouble they have visited You,\nThey poured out a prayer when\

    18: "¹⁸ We have been with child, we have been in pain;\nWe have, as it were, brought\

    19: "¹⁹ Your dead shall live;\nTogether with my dead body they shall arise.\n\
      Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust;\nFor your dew is like the dew of herbs,\n\

    21: "²¹ For behold, the Lord comes out of His place\nTo punish the inhabitants\

      And will no more cover her slain."
  27:
    1: "¹ In that day the Lord with His severe sword, great and strong,\nWill punish\
      \ Leviathan the fleeing serpent,\nLeviathan that twisted serpent;\nAnd He will\
      \ slay the reptile that is in the sea. \n"
    2: "² In that day sing to her,\n“A vineyard of red wine!\n"
    3: "³ I, the Lord, keep it,\nI water it every moment;\nLest any hurt it,\nI keep\
      \ it night and day.\n"
    4: "⁴ Fury is not in Me.\nWho would set briers and thorns\nAgainst Me in battle?\n\
      I would go through them,\nI would burn them together.\n"
    5: "⁵ Or let him take hold of My strength,\nThat he may make peace with Me;\n\

    6: "⁶ Those who come He shall cause to take root in Jacob;\nIsrael shall blossom\

    7: "⁷ Has He struck Israel as He struck those who struck him?\nOr has He been\

    8: "⁸ In measure, by sending it away,\nYou contended with it.\nHe removes it by\
      \ His rough wind\nIn the day of the east wind.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be covered;\nAnd this is all\
      \ the fruit of taking away his sin:\nWhen he makes all the stones of the altar\n\
      Like chalkstones that are beaten to dust,\nWooden images and incense altars\
      \ shall not stand. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet the fortified city will be desolate,\nThe habitation forsaken and\

      And consume its branches.\n"
    11: "¹¹ When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off;\nThe women come\
      \ and set them on fire.\nFor it is a people of no understanding;\nTherefore\

  28:
    1: "¹ Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,\nWhose glorious\

      \ bring them down to the earth with His hand.\n"
    3: "³ The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim,\nWill be trampled underfoot;\n"

    5: "⁵ In that day the Lord of hosts will be\nFor a crown of glory and a diadem\

    6: "⁶ For a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,\nAnd for strength to\
      \ those who turn back the battle at the gate. \n"
    7: "⁷ But they also have erred through wine,\nAnd through intoxicating drink are\
      \ out of the way;\nThe priest and the prophet have erred through intoxicating\

    8: "⁸ For all tables are full of vomit and filth;\nNo place is clean. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Whom will he teach knowledge?\nAnd whom will he make to understand the\

      \ to rest,”\nAnd, “This is the refreshing”;\nYet they would not hear.\n"
    13: "¹³ But the word of the Lord was to them,\n“Precept upon precept, precept\

      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scornful men,\nWho rule this\

    19: "¹⁹ As often as it goes out it will take you;\nFor morning by morning it will\

    20: "²⁰ For the bed is too short to stretch out on,\nAnd the covering so narrow\

      \ Mount Zion.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Pause and wonder!\nBlind yourselves and be blind!\nThey are drunk, but not\
      \ with wine;\nThey stagger, but not with intoxicating drink.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the Lord has poured out on you\nThe spirit of deep sleep,\nAnd has\
      \ closed your eyes, namely, the prophets;\nAnd He has covered your heads, namely,\
      \ the seers. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The whole vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed,\
      \ which men deliver to one who is literate, saying, “Read this, please.”\nAnd\
      \ he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then the book is delivered to one who is illiterate, saying, “Read this,\

    13: "¹³ Therefore the Lord said:\n“Inasmuch as these people draw near with their\
      \ mouths\nAnd honor Me with their lips,\nBut have removed their hearts far from\
      \ Me,\nAnd their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvelous work\nAmong this people,\n\
      A marvelous work and a wonder;\nFor the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,\n\
      And the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Woe to those who seek deep to hide their counsel far from the Lord,\n\
      And their works are in the dark;\nThey say, “Who sees us?” and, “Who knows us?”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Surely you have things turned around!\nShall the potter be esteemed as\

    17: "¹⁷ Is it not yet a very little while\nTill Lebanon shall be turned into a\
      \ fruitful field,\nAnd the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ In that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book,\nAnd the eyes of\

    19: "¹⁹ The humble also shall increase their joy in the Lord,\nAnd the poor among\

    20: "²⁰ For the terrible one is brought to nothing,\nThe scornful one is consumed,\n\
      And all who watch for iniquity are cut off—\n"
    21: "²¹ Who make a man an offender by a word,\nAnd lay a snare for him who reproves\

    22: "²² Therefore thus says the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house\

    23: "²³ But when he sees his children,\nThe work of My hands, in his midst,\n\

    3: "³ Therefore the strength of Pharaoh\nShall be your shame,\nAnd trust in the\

    4: "⁴ For his princes were at Zoan,\nAnd his ambassadors came to Hanes.\n"
    5: "⁵ They were all ashamed of a people who could not benefit them,\nOr be help\
      \ or benefit,\nBut a shame and also a reproach.” \n"

    11: "¹¹ Get out of the way,\nTurn aside from the path,\nCause the Holy One of\

    12: "¹² Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel:\n“Because you despise this\

    13: "¹³ Therefore this iniquity shall be to you\nLike a breach ready to fall,\n\
      A bulge in a high wall,\nWhose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And He shall break it like the breaking of the potter’s vessel,\nWhich\

      But you would not,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And you said, “No, for we will flee on horses”—\nTherefore you shall flee!\n\
      And, “We will ride on swift horses”—\nTherefore those who pursue you shall be\
      \ swift! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ One thousand shall flee at the threat of one,\nAt the threat of five you\
      \ shall flee,\nTill you are left as a pole on top of a mountain\nAnd as a banner\
      \ on a hill. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore the Lord will wait, that He may be gracious to you;\nAnd therefore\
      \ He will be exalted, that He may have mercy on you.\nFor the Lord is a God\
      \ of justice;\nBlessed are all those who wait for Him. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem;\nYou shall weep no more.\n\
      He will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry;\nWhen He hears it,\
      \ He will answer you.\n"
    20: "²⁰ And though the Lord gives you\nThe bread of adversity and the water of\
      \ affliction,\nYet your teachers will not be moved into a corner anymore,\n\
      But your eyes shall see your teachers.\n"
    21: "²¹ Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying,\n“This is the way, walk\

      \ left.\n"
    22: "²² You will also defile the covering of your images of silver,\nAnd the ornament\

      You will say to them, “Get away!” \n"
    23: "²³ Then He will give the rain for your seed\nWith which you sow the ground,\n\
      And bread of the increase of the earth;\nIt will be fat and plentiful.\nIn that\

    31: "³¹ For through the voice of the Lord\nAssyria will be beaten down,\nAs He\
      \ strikes with the rod.\n"
    32: "³² And in every place where the staff of punishment passes,\nWhich the Lord\

      \ He will fight with it.\n"
    33: "³³ For Tophet was established of old,\nYes, for the king it is prepared.\n\
      He has made it deep and large;\nIts pyre is fire with much wood;\nThe breath\

  31:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,\nAnd rely on horses,\nWho trust\

    2: "² Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster,\nAnd will not call back His\

      \ of those who work iniquity.\n"
    3: "³ Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;\nAnd their horses are flesh, and\

    5: "⁵ Like birds flying about,\nSo will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.\n\
      Defending, He will also deliver it;\nPassing over, He will preserve it.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Return to Him against whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. '
    7: "⁷ For in that day every man shall throw away his idols of silver and his idols\

    8: "⁸ “Then Assyria shall fall by a sword not of man,\nAnd a sword not of mankind\

    3: "³ The eyes of those who see will not be dim,\nAnd the ears of those who hear\

    4: "⁴ Also the heart of the rash will understand knowledge,\nAnd the tongue of\
      \ the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly. \n"
    5: "⁵ The foolish person will no longer be called generous,\nNor the miser said\
      \ to be bountiful;\n"
    6: "⁶ For the foolish person will speak foolishness,\nAnd his heart will work\
      \ iniquity:\nTo practice ungodliness,\nTo utter error against the Lord,\nTo\
      \ keep the hungry unsatisfied,\nAnd he will cause the drink of the thirsty to\

      With everlasting joy on their heads.\nThey shall obtain joy and gladness,\n\
      And sorrow and sighing shall flee away."
  36:
    1: '¹ Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib
      king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. '
    2: '² Then the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish
      to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool,
      on the highway to the Fuller’s Field. '
    3: "³ And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe,\
      \ and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great
      king, the king of Assyria: “What confidence is this in which you trust? '
    5: '⁵ I say you speak of having plans and power for war; but they are mere words.
      Now in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me? '
    6: "⁶ Look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which\
      \ if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king\
      \ of Egypt to all who trust in him. \n"
    7: '⁷ “But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the Lord our God,’ is it not He whose
      high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and
      Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’?” ’ '
    8: '⁸ Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria,
      and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put
      riders on them! '
    9: '⁹ How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master’s servants,
      and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? '
    10: "¹⁰ Have I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? The\
      \ Lord said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’ ” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to\
      \ your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in\
      \ Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” \n"
    12: "¹² But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you\
      \ to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat\
      \ and drink their own waste with you?” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and
      said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! '
    14: '¹⁴ Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not
      be able to deliver you; '
    15: '¹⁵ nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, “The Lord will surely
      deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”
      ’ '
    16: '¹⁶ Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace
      with me by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own
      vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters
      of his own cistern; '
    17: '¹⁷ until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
      grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. '
    18: '¹⁸ Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The Lord will deliver us.”
      Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered its land from the hand of the
      king of Assyria? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
      Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand? '
    20: "²⁰ Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from\
      \ my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’ ” \n"
    21: '²¹ But they held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s
      commandment was, “Do not answer him.” '
    22: ²² Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the
      scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their
      clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
  37:
    1: '¹ And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered
      himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. '
    2: '² Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and
      the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the
      son of Amoz. '
    3: '³ And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day is a day of trouble
      and rebuke and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is
      no strength to bring them forth. '
    4: "⁴ It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom\
      \ his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will\
      \ rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore lift up your\
      \ prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ” \n"
    5: '⁵ So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. '
    6: '⁶ And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says
      the Lord: “Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the
      servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. '
    7: "⁷ Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return\
      \ to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”\
      \ ’ ” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
      Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. '
    9: '⁹ And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out
      to make war with you.” So when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah,
      saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your
      God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into
      the hand of the king of Assyria.” '
    11: '¹¹ Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands
      by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? '
    12: '¹² Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed,
      Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? '
    13: "¹³ Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city\
      \ of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’ ” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and
      read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before
      the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying: '
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim,
      You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven
      and earth. '
    17: '¹⁷ Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, O Lord, and see; and
      hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living
      God. '
    18: '¹⁸ Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and
      their lands, '
    19: '¹⁹ and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the
      work of men’s hands—wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them. '
    20: "²⁰ Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms\
      \ of the earth may know that You are the Lord, You alone.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the Lord
      God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, '
    22: "²² this is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him:\n“The virgin,\
      \ the daughter of Zion,\nHas despised you, laughed you to scorn;\nThe daughter\
      \ of Jerusalem\nHas shaken her head behind your back! \n"
    23: "²³ “Whom have you reproached and blasphemed?\nAgainst whom have you raised\
      \ your voice,\nAnd lifted up your eyes on high?\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    24: "²⁴ By your servants you have reproached the Lord,\nAnd said, ‘By the multitude\
      \ of my chariots\nI have come up to the height of the mountains,\nTo the limits\
      \ of Lebanon;\nI will cut down its tall cedars\nAnd its choice cypress trees;\n\
      I will enter its farthest height,\nTo its fruitful forest.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I have dug and drunk water,\nAnd with the soles of my feet I have dried\
      \ up\nAll the brooks of defense.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “Did you not hear long ago\nHow I made it,\nFrom ancient times that I\
      \ formed it?\nNow I have brought it to pass,\nThat you should be\nFor crushing\
      \ fortified cities into heaps of ruins.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Therefore their inhabitants had little power;\nThey were dismayed and\
      \ confounded;\nThey were as the grass of the field\nAnd the green herb,\nAs\
      \ the grass on the housetops\nAnd grain blighted before it is grown. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “But I know your dwelling place,\nYour going out and your coming in,\n\
      And your rage against Me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because your rage against Me and your tumult\nHave come up to My ears,\n\
      Therefore I will put My hook in your nose\nAnd My bridle in your lips,\nAnd\
      \ I will turn you back\nBy the way which you came.” ’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ “This shall be a sign to you:\nYou shall eat this year such as grows of\
      \ itself,\nAnd the second year what springs from the same;\nAlso in the third\
      \ year sow and reap,\nPlant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.\n"
    31: "³¹ And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah\nShall again take\
      \ root downward,\nAnd bear fruit upward.\n"
    32: "³² For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant,\nAnd those who escape from Mount\
      \ Zion.\nThe zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. \n"
    33: "³³ “Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria:\n‘He shall\
      \ not come into this city,\nNor shoot an arrow there,\nNor come before it with\
      \ shield,\nNor build a siege mound against it.\n"
    34: "³⁴ By the way that he came,\nBy the same shall he return;\nAnd he shall not\
      \ come into this city,’\nSays the Lord.\n"
    35: "³⁵ ‘For I will defend this city, to save it\nFor My own sake and for My servant\
      \ David’s sake.’ ” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Then the angel of the Lord went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians
      one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when people arose early in the morning,
      there were the corpses—all dead. '
    37: '³⁷ So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned home,
      and remained at Nineveh. '
    38: ³⁸ Now it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god,
      that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword; and they
      escaped into the land of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
  38:
    1: "¹ In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet,\
      \ the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Set your\
      \ house in order, for you shall die and not live.’ ” \n"
    2: '² Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, '
    3: "³ and said, “Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before You in\
      \ truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what is good in Your sight.” And\
      \ Hezekiah wept bitterly. \n"
    4: '⁴ And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father:
      “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your
      days fifteen years. '
    6: '⁶ I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and
      I will defend this city.” ’ '
    7: '⁷ And this is the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing
      which He has spoken: '
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will bring the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down with\
      \ the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.” So the sun returned\
      \ ten degrees on the dial by which it had gone down. \n"
    9: "⁹ This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and\
      \ had recovered from his sickness: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I said,\n“In the prime of my life\nI shall go to the gates of Sheol;\n\
      I am deprived of the remainder of my years.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ I said,\n“I shall not see Yah,\nThe Lord in the land of the living;\n\
      I shall observe man no more among the inhabitants of the world.\n"
    12: "¹² My life span is gone,\nTaken from me like a shepherd’s tent;\nI have cut\
      \ off my life like a weaver.\nHe cuts me off from the loom;\nFrom day until\
      \ night You make an end of me.\n"
    13: "¹³ I have considered until morning—\nLike a lion,\nSo He breaks all my bones;\n\
      From day until night You make an end of me.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Like a crane or a swallow, so I chattered;\nI mourned like a dove;\nMy\
      \ eyes fail from looking upward.\nO Lord, I am oppressed;\nUndertake for me!\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “What shall I say?\nHe has both spoken to me,\nAnd He Himself has done\
      \ it.\nI shall walk carefully all my years\nIn the bitterness of my soul.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ O Lord, by these things men live;\nAnd in all these things is the life\
      \ of my spirit;\nSo You will restore me and make me live.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Indeed it was for my own peace\nThat I had great bitterness;\nBut You\
      \ have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of corruption,\nFor You have\
      \ cast all my sins behind Your back.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For Sheol cannot thank You,\nDeath cannot praise You;\nThose who go down\
      \ to the pit cannot hope for Your truth.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The living, the living man, he shall praise You,\nAs I do this day;\n\
      The father shall make known Your truth to the children. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “The Lord was ready to save me;\nTherefore we will sing my songs with\
      \ stringed instruments\nAll the days of our life, in the house of the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a lump of figs, and apply it as a\
      \ poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.” \n"
    22: ²² And Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house
      of the Lord?”
  39:
    1: '¹ At that time Merodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
      letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had
      recovered. '
    2: "² And Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his treasures—the\
      \ silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all\
      \ that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all\
      \ his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. \n"
    3: "³ Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did\
      \ these men say, and from where did they come to you?”\nSo Hezekiah said, “They\
      \ came to me from a far country, from Babylon.” \n"
    4: "⁴ And he said, “What have they seen in your house?”\nSo Hezekiah answered,\
      \ “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures\
      \ that I have not shown them.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: '
    6: '⁶ ‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your
      fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing
      shall be left,’ says the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ ‘And they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you, whom\
      \ you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’\
      \ ” \n"
    8: ⁸ So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord which you have spoken is
      good!” For he said, “At least there will be peace and truth in my days.”
  40:
    1: "¹ “Comfort, yes, comfort My people!”\nSays your God.\n"
    2: "² “Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her,\nThat her warfare is ended,\n\
      That her iniquity is pardoned;\nFor she has received from the Lord’s hand\n\
      Double for all her sins.” \n"
    3: "³ The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n“Prepare the way of the Lord;\n\
      Make straight in the desert\nA highway for our God.\n"
    4: "⁴ Every valley shall be exalted\nAnd every mountain and hill brought low;\n\
      The crooked places shall be made straight\nAnd the rough places smooth;\n"
    5: "⁵ The glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\nAnd all flesh shall see it together;\n\
      For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” \n"
    6: "⁶ The voice said, “Cry out!”\nAnd he said, “What shall I cry?” \n“All flesh\
      \ is grass,\nAnd all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.\n"
    7: "⁷ The grass withers, the flower fades,\nBecause the breath of the Lord blows\
      \ upon it;\nSurely the people are grass.\n"
    8: "⁸ The grass withers, the flower fades,\nBut the word of our God stands forever.”\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ O Zion,\nYou who bring good tidings,\nGet up into the high mountain;\nO\
      \ Jerusalem,\nYou who bring good tidings,\nLift up your voice with strength,\n\
      Lift it up, be not afraid;\nSay to the cities of Judah, “Behold your God!” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Behold, the Lord God shall come with a strong hand,\nAnd His arm shall\

    12: "¹² Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,\nMeasured heaven\

    13: "¹³ Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord,\nOr as His counselor has taught\
      \ Him?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him,\nAnd taught Him\

    15: "¹⁵ Behold, the nations are as a drop in a bucket,\nAnd are counted as the\
      \ small dust on the scales;\nLook, He lifts up the isles as a very little thing.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,\nNor its beasts sufficient for\

    17: "¹⁷ All nations before Him are as nothing,\nAnd they are counted by Him less\
      \ than nothing and worthless. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ To whom then will you liken God?\nOr what likeness will you compare to\
      \ Him?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The workman molds an image,\nThe goldsmith overspreads it with gold,\n\
      And the silversmith casts silver chains.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Whoever is too impoverished for such a contribution\nChooses a tree that\

    21: "²¹ Have you not known?\nHave you not heard?\nHas it not been told you from\

    23: "²³ He brings the princes to nothing;\nHe makes the judges of the earth useless.\

    25: "²⁵ “To whom then will you liken Me,\nOr to whom shall I be equal?” says the\

    26: "²⁶ Lift up your eyes on high,\nAnd see who has created these things,\nWho\

    13: "¹³ Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently;\nHe shall be exalted and extolled\
      \ and be very high.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Just as many were astonished at you,\nSo His visage was marred more than\
      \ any man,\nAnd His form more than the sons of men;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So shall He sprinkle many nations.\nKings shall shut their mouths at Him;\n\
      For what had not been told them they shall see,\nAnd what they had not heard\
      \ they shall consider."
  53:
    1: "¹ Who has believed our report?\nAnd to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\n"
    2: "² For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant,\nAnd as a root out of\
      \ dry ground.\nHe has no form or comeliness;\nAnd when we see Him,\nThere is\
      \ no beauty that we should desire Him.\n"
    3: "³ He is despised and rejected by men,\nA Man of sorrows and acquainted with\
      \ grief.\nAnd we hid, as it were, our faces from Him;\nHe was despised, and\
      \ we did not esteem Him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Surely He has borne our griefs\nAnd carried our sorrows;\nYet we esteemed\
      \ Him stricken,\nSmitten by God, and afflicted.\n"
    5: "⁵ But He was wounded for our transgressions,\nHe was bruised for our iniquities;\n\
      The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,\nAnd by His stripes we are healed.\n"
    6: "⁶ All we like sheep have gone astray;\nWe have turned, every one, to his own\
      \ way;\nAnd the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. \n"
    7: "⁷ He was oppressed and He was afflicted,\nYet He opened not His mouth;\nHe\
      \ was led as a lamb to the slaughter,\nAnd as a sheep before its shearers is\
      \ silent,\nSo He opened not His mouth.\n"
    8: "⁸ He was taken from prison and from judgment,\nAnd who will declare His generation?\n\
      For He was cut off from the land of the living;\nFor the transgressions of My\
      \ people He was stricken.\n"
    9: "⁹ And they made His grave with the wicked—\nBut with the rich at His death,\n\
      Because He had done no violence,\nNor was any deceit in His mouth. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him;\nHe has put Him to grief.\nWhen\
      \ You make His soul an offering for sin,\nHe shall see His seed, He shall prolong\
      \ His days,\nAnd the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied.\nBy His knowledge\
      \ My righteous Servant shall justify many,\nFor He shall bear their iniquities.\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great,\nAnd He shall divide\
      \ the spoil with the strong,\nBecause He poured out His soul unto death,\nAnd\
      \ He was numbered with the transgressors,\nAnd He bore the sin of many,\nAnd\
      \ made intercession for the transgressors."
  54:
    1: "¹ “Sing, O barren,\nYou who have not borne!\nBreak forth into singing, and\
      \ cry aloud,\nYou who have not labored with child!\nFor more are the children\
      \ of the desolate\nThan the children of the married woman,” says the Lord.\n"
    2: "² “Enlarge the place of your tent,\nAnd let them stretch out the curtains\
      \ of your dwellings;\nDo not spare;\nLengthen your cords,\nAnd strengthen your\
      \ stakes.\n"
    3: "³ For you shall expand to the right and to the left,\nAnd your descendants\

    4: "⁴ “Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed;\nNeither be disgraced, for you\
      \ will not be put to shame;\nFor you will forget the shame of your youth,\n\
      And will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore.\n"
    5: "⁵ For your Maker is your husband,\nThe Lord of hosts is His name;\nAnd your\
      \ Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel;\nHe is called the God of the whole earth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For the Lord has called you\nLike a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,\n\

    7: "⁷ “For a mere moment I have forsaken you,\nBut with great mercies I will gather\
      \ you.\n"
    8: "⁸ With a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment;\nBut with everlasting\
      \ kindness I will have mercy on you,”\nSays the Lord, your Redeemer. \n"
    9: "⁹ “For this is like the waters of Noah to Me;\nFor as I have sworn\nThat the\
      \ waters of Noah would no longer cover the earth,\nSo have I sworn\nThat I would\
      \ not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the mountains shall depart\nAnd the hills be removed,\nBut My kindness\
      \ shall not depart from you,\nNor shall My covenant of peace be removed,”\n\
      Says the Lord, who has mercy on you. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “O you afflicted one,\nTossed with tempest, and not comforted,\nBehold,\

    17: "¹⁷ No weapon formed against you shall prosper,\nAnd every tongue which rises\
      \ against you in judgment\nYou shall condemn.\nThis is the heritage of the servants\

  55:
    1: "¹ “Ho! Everyone who thirsts,\nCome to the waters;\nAnd you who have no money,\n\
      Come, buy and eat.\nYes, come, buy wine and milk\nWithout money and without\
      \ price.\n"
    2: "² Why do you spend money for what is not bread,\nAnd your wages for what does\
      \ not satisfy?\nListen carefully to Me, and eat what is good,\nAnd let your\
      \ soul delight itself in abundance.\n"
    3: "³ Incline your ear, and come to Me.\nHear, and your soul shall live;\nAnd\
      \ I will make an everlasting covenant with you—\nThe sure mercies of David.\n"
    4: "⁴ Indeed I have given him as a witness to the people,\nA leader and commander\

    6: "⁶ Seek the Lord while He may be found,\nCall upon Him while He is near.\n"
    7: "⁷ Let the wicked forsake his way,\nAnd the unrighteous man his thoughts;\n\

    8: "⁸ “For My thoughts are not your thoughts,\nNor are your ways My ways,” says\

    9: "⁹ “For as the heavens are higher than the earth,\nSo are My ways higher than\

  56:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“Keep justice, and do righteousness,\nFor My salvation\

    3: "³ Do not let the son of the foreigner\nWho has joined himself to the Lord\n\

    4: "⁴ For thus says the Lord:\n“To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths,\nAnd choose\

    5: "⁵ Even to them I will give in My house\nAnd within My walls a place and a\

    6: "⁶ “Also the sons of the foreigner\nWho join themselves to the Lord, to serve\

      \ keeps from defiling the Sabbath,\nAnd holds fast My covenant—\n"
    7: "⁷ Even them I will bring to My holy mountain,\nAnd make them joyful in My\

    9: "⁹ All you beasts of the field, come to devour,\nAll you beasts in the forest.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ His watchmen are blind,\nThey are all ignorant;\nThey are all dumb dogs,\n\
      They cannot bark;\nSleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Yes, they are greedy dogs\nWhich never have enough.\nAnd they are shepherds\n\

  57:
    1: "¹ The righteous perishes,\nAnd no man takes it to heart;\nMerciful men are\

    4: "⁴ Whom do you ridicule?\nAgainst whom do you make a wide mouth\nAnd stick\

    5: "⁵ Inflaming yourselves with gods under every green tree,\nSlaying the children\

    6: "⁶ Among the smooth stones of the stream\nIs your portion;\nThey, they, are\

    9: "⁹ You went to the king with ointment,\nAnd increased your perfumes;\nYou sent\

    10: "¹⁰ You are wearied in the length of your way;\nYet you did not say, ‘There\

    11: "¹¹ “And of whom have you been afraid, or feared,\nThat you have lied\nAnd\

    12: "¹² I will declare your righteousness\nAnd your works,\nFor they will not\

    16: "¹⁶ For I will not contend forever,\nNor will I always be angry;\nFor the\

    17: "¹⁷ For the iniquity of his covetousness\nI was angry and struck him;\nI hid\

    18: "¹⁸ I have seen his ways, and will heal him;\nI will also lead him,\nAnd restore\

    19: "¹⁹ “I create the fruit of the lips:\nPeace, peace to him who is far off and\

    20: "²⁰ But the wicked are like the troubled sea,\nWhen it cannot rest,\nWhose\

  58:
    1: "¹ “Cry aloud, spare not;\nLift up your voice like a trumpet;\nTell My people\

    2: "² Yet they seek Me daily,\nAnd delight to know My ways,\nAs a nation that\
      \ did righteousness,\nAnd did not forsake the ordinance of their God.\nThey\
      \ ask of Me the ordinances of justice;\nThey take delight in approaching God.\n"
    3: "³ ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and You have not seen?\nWhy have we afflicted\
      \ our souls, and You take no notice?’ \n“In fact, in the day of your fast you\
      \ find pleasure,\nAnd exploit all your laborers.\n"
    4: "⁴ Indeed you fast for strife and debate,\nAnd to strike with the fist of wickedness.\n\
      You will not fast as you do this day,\nTo make your voice heard on high.\n"
    5: "⁵ Is it a fast that I have chosen,\nA day for a man to afflict his soul?\n\
      Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush,\nAnd to spread out sackcloth and\

    6: "⁶ “Is this not the fast that I have chosen:\nTo loose the bonds of wickedness,\n\
      To undo the heavy burdens,\nTo let the oppressed go free,\nAnd that you break\

    6: "⁶ Their webs will not become garments,\nNor will they cover themselves with\

  65:
    1: "¹ “I was sought by those who did not ask for Me;\nI was found by those who\

    13: "¹³ Therefore thus says the Lord God:\n“Behold, My servants shall eat,\nBut\

      Behold, My servants shall rejoice,\nBut you shall be ashamed;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart,\nBut you shall cry for\
      \ sorrow of heart,\nAnd wail for grief of spirit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You shall leave your name as a curse to My chosen;\nFor the Lord God will\
      \ slay you,\nAnd call His servants by another name;\n"
    16: "¹⁶ So that he who blesses himself in the earth\nShall bless himself in the\
      \ God of truth;\nAnd he who swears in the earth\nShall swear by the God of truth;\n\
      Because the former troubles are forgotten,\nAnd because they are hidden from\

    17: "¹⁷ “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;\nAnd the former shall\
      \ not be remembered or come to mind.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create;\nFor behold, I create\
      \ Jerusalem as a rejoicing,\nAnd her people a joy.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will rejoice in Jerusalem,\nAnd joy in My people;\nThe voice of weeping\
      \ shall no longer be heard in her,\nNor the voice of crying. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “No more shall an infant from there live but a few days,\nNor an old man\
      \ who has not fulfilled his days;\nFor the child shall die one hundred years\
      \ old,\nBut the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.\n"
    21: "²¹ They shall build houses and inhabit them;\nThey shall plant vineyards\
      \ and eat their fruit.\n"
    22: "²² They shall not build and another inhabit;\nThey shall not plant and another\
      \ eat;\nFor as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of My people,\nAnd My\
      \ elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\n"
    23: "²³ They shall not labor in vain,\nNor bring forth children for trouble;\n\
      For they shall be the descendants of the blessed of the Lord,\nAnd their offspring\
      \ with them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ “It shall come to pass\nThat before they call, I will answer;\nAnd while\
      \ they are still speaking, I will hear.\n"
    25: "²⁵ The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,\nThe lion shall eat straw like\
      \ the ox,\nAnd dust shall be the serpent’s food.\nThey shall not hurt nor destroy\
      \ in all My holy mountain,”\nSays the Lord."
  66:
    1: "¹ Thus says the Lord:\n“Heaven is My throne,\nAnd earth is My footstool.\n\
      Where is the house that you will build Me?\nAnd where is the place of My rest?\n"
    2: "² For all those things My hand has made,\nAnd all those things exist,”\nSays\
      \ the Lord.\n“But on this one will I look:\nOn him who is poor and of a contrite\
      \ spirit,\nAnd who trembles at My word. \n"
    3: "³ “He who kills a bull is as if he slays a man;\nHe who sacrifices a lamb,\

    4: "⁴ So will I choose their delusions,\nAnd bring their fears on them;\nBecause,\

    5: "⁵ Hear the word of the Lord,\nYou who tremble at His word:\n“Your brethren\

    6: "⁶ The sound of noise from the city!\nA voice from the temple!\nThe voice of\

    18: '¹⁸ “For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall be that I will gather
