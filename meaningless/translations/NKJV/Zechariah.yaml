Zechariah:
  1:
    1: '¹ In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came
      to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, '
    2: '² “The Lord has been very angry with your fathers. '
    3: '³ Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Return to Me,” says
      the Lord of hosts, “and I will return to you,” says the Lord of hosts. '
    4: "⁴ “Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets preached, saying,\
      \ ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Turn now from your evil ways and your evil\
      \ deeds.” ’ But they did not hear nor heed Me,” says the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Your fathers, where are they?\nAnd the prophets, do they live forever?\n"
    6: "⁶ Yet surely My words and My statutes,\nWhich I commanded My servants the\
      \ prophets,\nDid they not overtake your fathers?\n“So they returned and said:\n\
      ‘Just as the Lord of hosts determined to do to us,\nAccording to our ways and\
      \ according to our deeds,\nSo He has dealt with us.’ ” ’ ” \n"
    7: '⁷ On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat,
      in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son
      of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet: '
    8: '⁸ I saw by night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse, and it stood among
      the myrtle trees in the hollow; and behind him were horses: red, sorrel, and
      white. '
    9: "⁹ Then I said, “My lord, what are these?” So the angel who talked with me\
      \ said to me, “I will show you what they are.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, “These\
      \ are the ones whom the Lord has sent to walk to and fro throughout the earth.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ So they answered the Angel of the Lord, who stood among the myrtle trees,\
      \ and said, “We have walked to and fro throughout the earth, and behold, all\
      \ the earth is resting quietly.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then the Angel of the Lord answered and said, “O Lord of hosts, how long\
      \ will You not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which\
      \ You were angry these seventy years?” \n"
    13: '¹³ And the Lord answered the angel who talked to me, with good and comforting
      words. '
    14: "¹⁴ So the angel who spoke with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says\
      \ the Lord of hosts:\n“I am zealous for Jerusalem\nAnd for Zion with great zeal.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I am exceedingly angry with the nations at ease;\nFor I was a little angry,\n\
      And they helped—but with evil intent.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘Therefore thus says the Lord:\n“I am returning to Jerusalem with mercy;\n\
      My house shall be built in it,” says the Lord of hosts,\n“And a surveyor’s line\
      \ shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.” ’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Again proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n“My cities shall\
      \ again spread out through prosperity;\nThe Lord will again comfort Zion,\n\
      And will again choose Jerusalem.” ’ ” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then I raised my eyes and looked, and there were four horns. '
    19: "¹⁹ And I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these?”\nSo he answered\
      \ me, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen. '
    21: "²¹ And I said, “What are these coming to do?”\nSo he said, “These are the\
      \ horns that scattered Judah, so that no one could lift up his head; but the\
      \ craftsmen are coming to terrify them, to cast out the horns of the nations\
      \ that lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”"
  2:
    1: '¹ Then I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring line
      in his hand. '
    2: "² So I said, “Where are you going?”\nAnd he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem,\
      \ to see what is its width and what is its length.” \n"
    3: '³ And there was the angel who talked with me, going out; and another angel
      was coming out to meet him, '
    4: '⁴ who said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying: ‘Jerusalem shall
      be inhabited as towns without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock
      in it. '
    5: "⁵ For I,’ says the Lord, ‘will be a wall of fire all around her, and I will\
      \ be the glory in her midst.’ ” \n"
    6: '⁶ “Up, up! Flee from the land of the north,” says the Lord; “for I have spread
      you abroad like the four winds of heaven,” says the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ “Up, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.” \n"
    8: '⁸ For thus says the Lord of hosts: “He sent Me after glory, to the nations
      which plunder you; for he who touches you touches the apple of His eye. '
    9: "⁹ For surely I will shake My hand against them, and they shall become spoil\
      \ for their servants. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent Me.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For behold, I am coming and I will
      dwell in your midst,” says the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ “Many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and they shall
      become My people. And I will dwell in your midst. Then you will know that the
      Lord of hosts has sent Me to you. '
    12: '¹² And the Lord will take possession of Judah as His inheritance in the Holy
      Land, and will again choose Jerusalem. '
    13: ¹³ Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord, for He is aroused from His holy
      habitation!”
  3:
    1: '¹ Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the
      Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him. '
    2: "² And the Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has\
      \ chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?” \n"
    3: "³ Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the\
      \ Angel. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, “Take\
      \ away the filthy garments from him.” And to him He said, “See, I have removed\
      \ your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes.” \n"
    5: "⁵ And I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.”\nSo they put a clean\
      \ turban on his head, and they put the clothes on him. And the Angel of the\
      \ Lord stood by. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the Angel of the Lord admonished Joshua, saying, '
    7: "⁷ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘If you will walk in My ways,\nAnd if you\
      \ will keep My command,\nThen you shall also judge My house,\nAnd likewise have\
      \ charge of My courts;\nI will give you places to walk\nAmong these who stand\
      \ here. \n"
    8: "⁸ ‘Hear, O Joshua, the high priest,\nYou and your companions who sit before\
      \ you,\nFor they are a wondrous sign;\nFor behold, I am bringing forth My Servant\
      \ the BRANCH.\n"
    9: "⁹ For behold, the stone\nThat I have laid before Joshua:\nUpon the stone are\
      \ seven eyes.\nBehold, I will engrave its inscription,’\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n\
      ‘And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ In that day,’ says the Lord of hosts,\n‘Everyone will invite his neighbor\n\
      Under his vine and under his fig tree.’ ”"
  4:
    1: '¹ Now the angel who talked with me came back and wakened me, as a man who
      is wakened out of his sleep. '
    2: "² And he said to me, “What do you see?”\nSo I said, “I am looking, and there\
      \ is a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the stand seven\
      \ lamps with seven pipes to the seven lamps. "
    3: '³ Two olive trees are by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at
      its left.” '
    4: "⁴ So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What are\
      \ these, my lord?” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know\
      \ what these are?”\nAnd I said, “No, my lord.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So he answered and said to me:\n“This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel:\n\
      ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n"
    7: "⁷ ‘Who are you, O great mountain?\nBefore Zerubbabel you shall become a plain!\n\
      And he shall bring forth the capstone\nWith shouts of “Grace, grace to it!”\
      \ ’ ” \n"
    8: "⁸ Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying: \n"
    9: "⁹ “The hands of Zerubbabel\nHave laid the foundation of this temple;\nHis\
      \ hands shall also finish it.\nThen you will know\nThat the Lord of hosts has\
      \ sent Me to you.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For who has despised the day of small things?\nFor these seven rejoice\
      \ to see\nThe plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.\nThey are the eyes of the\
      \ Lord,\nWhich scan to and fro throughout the whole earth.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then I answered and said to him, “What are these two olive trees—at the
      right of the lampstand and at its left?” '
    12: "¹² And I further answered and said to him, “What are these two olive branches\
      \ that drip into the receptacles of the two gold pipes from which the golden\
      \ oil drains?” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then he answered me and said, “Do you not know what these are?”\nAnd I\
      \ said, “No, my lord.” \n"
    14: ¹⁴ So he said, “These are the two anointed ones, who stand beside the Lord
      of the whole earth.”
  5:
    1: "¹ Then I turned and raised my eyes, and saw there a flying scroll. \n"
    2: "² And he said to me, “What do you see?”\nSo I answered, “I see a flying scroll.\
      \ Its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.” \n"
    3: "³ Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the\
      \ whole earth: ‘Every thief shall be expelled,’ according to this side of the\
      \ scroll; and, ‘Every perjurer shall be expelled,’ according to that side of\
      \ it.” \n"
    4: "⁴ “I will send out the curse,” says the Lord of hosts;\n“It shall enter the\
      \ house of the thief\nAnd the house of the one who swears falsely by My name.\n\
      It shall remain in the midst of his house\nAnd consume it, with its timber and\
      \ stones.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Then the angel who talked with me came out and said to me, “Lift your eyes\
      \ now, and see what this is that goes forth.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So I asked, “What is it?” And he said, “It is a basket that is going forth.”\n\
      He also said, “This is their resemblance throughout the earth: "
    7: '⁷ Here is a lead disc lifted up, and this is a woman sitting inside the basket”; '
    8: '⁸ then he said, “This is Wickedness!” And he thrust her down into the basket,
      and threw the lead cover over its mouth. '
    9: "⁹ Then I raised my eyes and looked, and there were two women, coming with\
      \ the wind in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and\
      \ they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ So I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are they carrying the\
      \ basket?” \n"
    11: ¹¹ And he said to me, “To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; when
      it is ready, the basket will be set there on its base.”
  6:
    1: '¹ Then I turned and raised my eyes and looked, and behold, four chariots were
      coming from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of bronze. '
    2: '² With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, '
    3: '³ with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot dappled
      horses—strong steeds. '
    4: "⁴ Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these,\
      \ my lord?” \n"
    5: '⁵ And the angel answered and said to me, “These are four spirits of heaven,
      who go out from their station before the Lord of all the earth. '
    6: '⁶ The one with the black horses is going to the north country, the white are
      going after them, and the dappled are going toward the south country.” '
    7: '⁷ Then the strong steeds went out, eager to go, that they might walk to and
      fro throughout the earth. And He said, “Go, walk to and fro throughout the earth.”
      So they walked to and fro throughout the earth. '
    8: "⁸ And He called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “See, those who go toward\
      \ the north country have given rest to My Spirit in the north country.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: '
    10: '¹⁰ “Receive the gift from the captives—from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah,
      who have come from Babylon—and go the same day and enter the house of Josiah
      the son of Zephaniah. '
    11: '¹¹ Take the silver and gold, make an elaborate crown, and set it on the head
      of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. '
    12: "¹² Then speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying:\n“Behold,\
      \ the Man whose name is the BRANCH!\nFrom His place He shall branch out,\nAnd\
      \ He shall build the temple of the Lord;\n"
    13: "¹³ Yes, He shall build the temple of the Lord.\nHe shall bear the glory,\n\
      And shall sit and rule on His throne;\nSo He shall be a priest on His throne,\n\
      And the counsel of peace shall be between them both.” ’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Now the elaborate crown shall be for a memorial in the temple of the
      Lord for Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah. '
    15: ¹⁵ Even those from afar shall come and build the temple of the Lord. Then
      you shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent Me to you. And this shall come
      to pass if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.”
  7:
    1: '¹ Now in the fourth year of King Darius it came to pass that the word of the
      Lord came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, Chislev, '
    2: '² when the people sent Sherezer, with Regem-Melech and his men, to the house
      of God, to pray before the Lord, '
    3: "³ and to ask the priests who were in the house of the Lord of hosts, and the\
      \ prophets, saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month and fast as I have done\
      \ for so many years?” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “Say to all the people of the land, and to the priests: ‘When you fasted
      and mourned in the fifth and seventh months during those seventy years, did
      you really fast for Me—for Me? '
    6: '⁶ When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat and drink for yourselves? '
    7: "⁷ Should you not have obeyed the words which the Lord proclaimed through the\
      \ former prophets when Jerusalem and the cities around it were inhabited and\
      \ prosperous, and the South and the Lowland were inhabited?’ ” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying, '
    9: "⁹ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘Execute true justice,\nShow mercy and compassion\n\
      Everyone to his brother.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless,\nThe alien or the poor.\n\
      Let none of you plan evil in his heart\nAgainst his brother.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “But they refused to heed, shrugged their shoulders, and stopped their
      ears so that they could not hear. '
    12: '¹² Yes, they made their hearts like flint, refusing to hear the law and the
      words which the Lord of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets.
      Thus great wrath came from the Lord of hosts. '
    13: '¹³ Therefore it happened, that just as He proclaimed and they would not hear,
      so they called out and I would not listen,” says the Lord of hosts. '
    14: ¹⁴ “But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they
      had not known. Thus the land became desolate after them, so that no one passed
      through or returned; for they made the pleasant land desolate.”
  8:
    1: '¹ Again the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying, '
    2: "² “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘I am zealous for Zion with great zeal;\n\
      With great fervor I am zealous for her.’ \n"
    3: "³ “Thus says the Lord:\n‘I will return to Zion,\nAnd dwell in the midst of\
      \ Jerusalem.\nJerusalem shall be called the City of Truth,\nThe Mountain of\
      \ the Lord of hosts,\nThe Holy Mountain.’ \n"
    4: "⁴ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘Old men and old women shall again sit\n\
      In the streets of Jerusalem,\nEach one with his staff in his hand\nBecause of\
      \ great age.\n"
    5: "⁵ The streets of the city\nShall be full of boys and girls\nPlaying in its\
      \ streets.’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant\
      \ of this people in these days,\nWill it also be marvelous in My eyes?’\nSays\
      \ the Lord of hosts. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘Behold, I will save My people from the land\
      \ of the east\nAnd from the land of the west;\n"
    8: "⁸ I will bring them back,\nAnd they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.\n\
      They shall be My people\nAnd I will be their God,\nIn truth and righteousness.’\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘Let your hands be strong,\nYou who have\
      \ been hearing in these days\nThese words by the mouth of the prophets,\nWho\
      \ spoke in the day the foundation was laid\nFor the house of the Lord of hosts,\n\
      That the temple might be built.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For before these days\nThere were no wages for man nor any hire for beast;\n\
      There was no peace from the enemy for whoever went out or came in;\nFor I set\
      \ all men, everyone, against his neighbor. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,’\
      \ says the Lord of hosts. \n"
    12: "¹² ‘For the seed shall be prosperous,\nThe vine shall give its fruit,\nThe\
      \ ground shall give her increase,\nAnd the heavens shall give their dew—\nI\
      \ will cause the remnant of this people\nTo possess all these.\n"
    13: "¹³ And it shall come to pass\nThat just as you were a curse among the nations,\n\
      O house of Judah and house of Israel,\nSo I will save you, and you shall be\
      \ a blessing.\nDo not fear,\nLet your hands be strong.’ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “For thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘Just as I determined to punish you\n\
      When your fathers provoked Me to wrath,’\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n‘And I would\
      \ not relent,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So again in these days\nI am determined to do good\nTo Jerusalem and to\
      \ the house of Judah.\nDo not fear.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ These are the things you shall do:\nSpeak each man the truth to his neighbor;\n\
      Give judgment in your gates for truth, justice, and peace;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let none of you think evil in your heart against your neighbor;\nAnd do\
      \ not love a false oath.\nFor all these are things that I hate,’\nSays the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, '
    19: "¹⁹ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘The fast of the fourth month,\nThe fast\
      \ of the fifth,\nThe fast of the seventh,\nAnd the fast of the tenth,\nShall\
      \ be joy and gladness and cheerful feasts\nFor the house of Judah.\nTherefore\
      \ love truth and peace.’ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘Peoples shall yet come,\nInhabitants of\
      \ many cities;\n"
    21: "²¹ The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,\n“Let us continue\
      \ to go and pray before the Lord,\nAnd seek the Lord of hosts.\nI myself will\
      \ go also.”\n"
    22: "²² Yes, many peoples and strong nations\nShall come to seek the Lord of hosts\
      \ in Jerusalem,\nAnd to pray before the Lord.’ \n"
    23: '²³ “Thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘In those days ten men from every language
      of the nations shall grasp the sleeve of a Jewish man, saying, “Let us go with
      you, for we have heard that God is with you.” ’ ”'
  9:
    1: "¹ The burden of the word of the Lord\nAgainst the land of Hadrach,\nAnd Damascus\
      \ its resting place\n(For the eyes of men\nAnd all the tribes of Israel\nAre\
      \ on the Lord);\n"
    2: "² Also against Hamath, which borders on it,\nAnd against Tyre and Sidon, though\
      \ they are very wise. \n"
    3: "³ For Tyre built herself a tower,\nHeaped up silver like the dust,\nAnd gold\
      \ like the mire of the streets.\n"
    4: "⁴ Behold, the Lord will cast her out;\nHe will destroy her power in the sea,\n\
      And she will be devoured by fire. \n"
    5: "⁵ Ashkelon shall see it and fear;\nGaza also shall be very sorrowful;\nAnd\
      \ Ekron, for He dried up her expectation.\nThe king shall perish from Gaza,\n\
      And Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. \n"
    6: "⁶ “A mixed race shall settle in Ashdod,\nAnd I will cut off the pride of the\
      \ Philistines.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will take away the blood from his mouth,\nAnd the abominations from between\
      \ his teeth.\nBut he who remains, even he shall be for our God,\nAnd shall be\
      \ like a leader in Judah,\nAnd Ekron like a Jebusite.\n"
    8: "⁸ I will camp around My house\nBecause of the army,\nBecause of him who passes\
      \ by and him who returns.\nNo more shall an oppressor pass through them,\nFor\
      \ now I have seen with My eyes. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!\nShout, O daughter of Jerusalem!\n\
      Behold, your King is coming to you;\nHe is just and having salvation,\nLowly\
      \ and riding on a donkey,\nA colt, the foal of a donkey.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim\nAnd the horse from Jerusalem;\n\
      The battle bow shall be cut off.\nHe shall speak peace to the nations;\nHis\
      \ dominion shall be ‘from sea to sea,\nAnd from the River to the ends of the\
      \ earth.’ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “As for you also,\nBecause of the blood of your covenant,\nI will set\
      \ your prisoners free from the waterless pit.\n"
    12: "¹² Return to the stronghold,\nYou prisoners of hope.\nEven today I declare\n\
      That I will restore double to you.\n"
    13: "¹³ For I have bent Judah, My bow,\nFitted the bow with Ephraim,\nAnd raised\
      \ up your sons, O Zion,\nAgainst your sons, O Greece,\nAnd made you like the\
      \ sword of a mighty man.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then the Lord will be seen over them,\nAnd His arrow will go forth like\
      \ lightning.\nThe Lord God will blow the trumpet,\nAnd go with whirlwinds from\
      \ the south.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord of hosts will defend them;\nThey shall devour and subdue with\
      \ slingstones.\nThey shall drink and roar as if with wine;\nThey shall be filled\
      \ with blood like basins,\nLike the corners of the altar.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord their God will save them in that day,\nAs the flock of His people.\n\
      For they shall be like the jewels of a crown,\nLifted like a banner over His\

  10:
    1: "¹ Ask the Lord for rain\nIn the time of the latter rain.\nThe Lord will make\
      \ flashing clouds;\nHe will give them showers of rain,\nGrass in the field for\
      \ everyone. \n"
    2: "² For the idols speak delusion;\nThe diviners envision lies,\nAnd tell false\
      \ dreams;\nThey comfort in vain.\nTherefore the people wend their way like sheep;\n\
      They are in trouble because there is no shepherd. \n"
    3: "³ “My anger is kindled against the shepherds,\nAnd I will punish the goatherds.\n\
      For the Lord of hosts will visit His flock,\nThe house of Judah,\nAnd will make\
      \ them as His royal horse in the battle.\n"
    4: "⁴ From him comes the cornerstone,\nFrom him the tent peg,\nFrom him the battle\
      \ bow,\nFrom him every ruler together.\n"
    5: "⁵ They shall be like mighty men,\nWho tread down their enemies\nIn the mire\
      \ of the streets in the battle.\nThey shall fight because the Lord is with them,\n\
      And the riders on horses shall be put to shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I will strengthen the house of Judah,\nAnd I will save the house of Joseph.\n\
      I will bring them back,\nBecause I have mercy on them.\nThey shall be as though\
      \ I had not cast them aside;\nFor I am the Lord their God,\nAnd I will hear\
      \ them.\n"
    7: "⁷ Those of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man,\nAnd their heart shall rejoice\
      \ as if with wine.\nYes, their children shall see it and be glad;\nTheir heart\

    11: "¹¹ He shall pass through the sea with affliction,\nAnd strike the waves of\

    4: '⁴ Thus says the Lord my God, “Feed the flock for slaughter, '
    5: '⁵ whose owners slaughter them and feel no guilt; those who sell them say,
      ‘Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich’; and their shepherds do not pity them. '
    6: "⁶ For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land,” says the Lord. “But\
      \ indeed I will give everyone into his neighbor’s hand and into the hand of\
      \ his king. They shall attack the land, and I will not deliver them from their\
      \ hand.” \n"
    7: '⁷ So I fed the flock for slaughter, in particular the poor of the flock. I
      took for myself two staffs: the one I called Beauty, and the other I called
      Bonds; and I fed the flock. '
    8: '⁸ I dismissed the three shepherds in one month. My soul loathed them, and
      their soul also abhorred me. '
    9: '⁹ Then I said, “I will not feed you. Let what is dying die, and what is perishing
      perish. Let those that are left eat each other’s flesh.” '
    10: '¹⁰ And I took my staff, Beauty, and cut it in two, that I might break the
      covenant which I had made with all the peoples. '
    11: '¹¹ So it was broken on that day. Thus the poor of the flock, who were watching
      me, knew that it was the word of the Lord. '
    12: "¹² Then I said to them, “If it is agreeable to you, give me my wages; and\
      \ if not, refrain.” So they weighed out for my wages thirty pieces of silver.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—that princely price
      they set on me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the
      house of the Lord for the potter. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then I cut in two my other staff, Bonds, that I might break the brotherhood\
      \ between Judah and Israel. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ And the Lord said to me, “Next, take for yourself the implements of a
      foolish shepherd. '
    16: "¹⁶ For indeed I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for\
      \ those who are cut off, nor seek the young, nor heal those that are broken,\
      \ nor feed those that still stand. But he will eat the flesh of the fat and\
      \ tear their hooves in pieces. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Woe to the worthless shepherd,\nWho leaves the flock!\nA sword shall\
      \ be against his arm\nAnd against his right eye;\nHis arm shall completely wither,\n\
      And his right eye shall be totally blinded.”"
  12:
    1: '¹ The burden of the word of the Lord against Israel. Thus says the Lord, who
      stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit
      of man within him: '
    2: '² “Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding
      peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. '
    3: '³ And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy
      stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces,
      though all nations of the earth are gathered against it. '
    4: '⁴ In that day,” says the Lord, “I will strike every horse with confusion,
      and its rider with madness; I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will
      strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. '
    5: '⁵ And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of
      Jerusalem are my strength in the Lord of hosts, their God.’ '
    6: "⁶ In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan in the woodpile,\
      \ and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding\
      \ peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited\
      \ again in her own place—Jerusalem. \n"
    7: '⁷ “The Lord will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house
      of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall not become greater
      than that of Judah. '
    8: '⁸ In that day the Lord will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the one who
      is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David
      shall be like God, like the Angel of the Lord before them. '
    9: "⁹ It shall be in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that\
      \ come against Jerusalem. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem
      the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced.
      Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for
      Him as one grieves for a firstborn. '
    11: '¹¹ In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning
      at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. '
    12: '¹² And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the family of the house
      of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of
      Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; '
    13: '¹³ the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves;
      the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves; '
    14: ¹⁴ all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by
      themselves.
  13:
    1: "¹ “In that day a fountain shall be opened for the house of David and for the\
      \ inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. \n"
    2: '² “It shall be in that day,” says the Lord of hosts, “that I will cut off
      the names of the idols from the land, and they shall no longer be remembered.
      I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to depart from the land. '
    3: "³ It shall come to pass that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and\
      \ mother who begot him will say to him, ‘You shall not live, because you have\
      \ spoken lies in the name of the Lord.’ And his father and mother who begot\
      \ him shall thrust him through when he prophesies. \n"
    4: '⁴ “And it shall be in that day that every prophet will be ashamed of his vision
      when he prophesies; they will not wear a robe of coarse hair to deceive. '
    5: '⁵ But he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a farmer; for a man taught me to
      keep cattle from my youth.’ '
    6: "⁶ And one will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then\
      \ he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ “Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd,\nAgainst the Man who is My Companion,”\n\
      Says the Lord of hosts.\n“Strike the Shepherd,\nAnd the sheep will be scattered;\n\
      Then I will turn My hand against the little ones.\n"
    8: "⁸ And it shall come to pass in all the land,”\nSays the Lord,\n“That two-thirds\
      \ in it shall be cut off and die,\nBut one-third shall be left in it:\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bring the one-third through the fire,\nWill refine them as silver\
      \ is refined,\nAnd test them as gold is tested.\nThey will call on My name,\n\
      And I will answer them.\nI will say, ‘This is My people’;\nAnd each one will\
      \ say, ‘The Lord is my God.’ ”"
  14:
    1: "¹ Behold, the day of the Lord is coming,\nAnd your spoil will be divided in\
      \ your midst.\n"
    2: "² For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem;\nThe city\
      \ shall be taken,\nThe houses rifled,\nAnd the women ravished.\nHalf of the\
      \ city shall go into captivity,\nBut the remnant of the people shall not be\
      \ cut off from the city. \n"
    3: "³ Then the Lord will go forth\nAnd fight against those nations,\nAs He fights\
      \ in the day of battle.\n"
    4: "⁴ And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives,\nWhich faces\
      \ Jerusalem on the east.\nAnd the Mount of Olives shall be split in two,\nFrom\
      \ east to west,\nMaking a very large valley;\nHalf of the mountain shall move\
      \ toward the north\nAnd half of it toward the south. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then you shall flee through My mountain valley,\nFor the mountain valley\
      \ shall reach to Azal.\nYes, you shall flee\nAs you fled from the earthquake\n\
      In the days of Uzziah king of Judah. \nThus the Lord my God will come,\nAnd\
      \ all the saints with You. \n"
    6: "⁶ It shall come to pass in that day\nThat there will be no light;\nThe lights\
      \ will diminish.\n"
    7: "⁷ It shall be one day\nWhich is known to the Lord—\nNeither day nor night.\n\
      But at evening time it shall happen\nThat it will be light. \n"
    8: "⁸ And in that day it shall be\nThat living waters shall flow from Jerusalem,\n\
      Half of them toward the eastern sea\nAnd half of them toward the western sea;\n\
      In both summer and winter it shall occur.\n"
    9: "⁹ And the Lord shall be King over all the earth.\nIn that day it shall be—\n\
      “The Lord is one,”\nAnd His name one. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ All the land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of\
      \ Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be raised up and inhabited in her place from Benjamin’s\
      \ Gate to the place of the First Gate and the Corner Gate, and from the Tower\
      \ of Hananel to the king’s winepresses. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The people shall dwell in it;\nAnd no longer shall there be utter destruction,\n\
      But Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. \n"
    12: "¹² And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the people\
      \ who fought against Jerusalem:\nTheir flesh shall dissolve while they stand\
      \ on their feet,\nTheir eyes shall dissolve in their sockets,\nAnd their tongues\
      \ shall dissolve in their mouths. \n"
    13: "¹³ It shall come to pass in that day\nThat a great panic from the Lord will\
      \ be among them.\nEveryone will seize the hand of his neighbor,\nAnd raise his\
      \ hand against his neighbor’s hand;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Judah also will fight at Jerusalem.\nAnd the wealth of all the surrounding\
      \ nations\nShall be gathered together:\nGold, silver, and apparel in great abundance.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Such also shall be the plague\nOn the horse and the mule,\nOn the camel\
      \ and the donkey,\nAnd on all the cattle that will be in those camps.\nSo shall\
      \ this plague be. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations
      which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King,
      the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. '
    17: '¹⁷ And it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come
      up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, on them there will be
      no rain. '
    18: '¹⁸ If the family of Egypt will not come up and enter in, they shall have
      no rain; they shall receive the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations
      who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. '
    19: "¹⁹ This shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations\
      \ that do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. \n"
    20: '²⁰ In that day “HOLINESS TO THE LORD” shall be engraved on the bells of the
      horses. The pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar. '
    21: ²¹ Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holiness to the Lord of
      hosts. Everyone who sacrifices shall come and take them and cook in them. In
      that day there shall no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts.
