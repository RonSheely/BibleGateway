Malachi:
  1:
    1: "¹ The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. \n"
    2: "² “I have loved you,” says the Lord.\n“Yet you say, ‘In what way have You\
      \ loved us?’\nWas not Esau Jacob’s brother?”\nSays the Lord.\n“Yet Jacob I have\
      \ loved;\n"
    3: "³ But Esau I have hated,\nAnd laid waste his mountains and his heritage\n\
      For the jackals of the wilderness.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Even though Edom has said,\n“We have been impoverished,\nBut we will return\
      \ and build the desolate places,”\nThus says the Lord of hosts:\n“They may build,\
      \ but I will throw down;\nThey shall be called the Territory of Wickedness,\n\
      And the people against whom the Lord will have indignation forever.\n"
    5: "⁵ Your eyes shall see,\nAnd you shall say,\n‘The Lord is magnified beyond\
      \ the border of Israel.’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “A son honors his father,\nAnd a servant his master.\nIf then I am the Father,\n\
      Where is My honor?\nAnd if I am a Master,\nWhere is My reverence?\nSays the\
      \ Lord of hosts\nTo you priests who despise My name.\nYet you say, ‘In what\
      \ way have we despised Your name?’ \n"
    7: "⁷ “You offer defiled food on My altar,\nBut say,\n‘In what way have we defiled\
      \ You?’\nBy saying,\n‘The table of the Lord is contemptible.’\n"
    8: "⁸ And when you offer the blind as a sacrifice,\nIs it not evil?\nAnd when\
      \ you offer the lame and sick,\nIs it not evil?\nOffer it then to your governor!\n\
      Would he be pleased with you?\nWould he accept you favorably?”\nSays the Lord\
      \ of hosts. \n"
    9: "⁹ “But now entreat God’s favor,\nThat He may be gracious to us.\nWhile this\
      \ is being done by your hands,\nWill He accept you favorably?”\nSays the Lord\
      \ of hosts.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Who is there even among you who would shut the doors,\nSo that you would\
      \ not kindle fire on My altar in vain?\nI have no pleasure in you,”\nSays the\
      \ Lord of hosts,\n“Nor will I accept an offering from your hands.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down,\nMy name shall\
      \ be great among the Gentiles;\nIn every place incense shall be offered to My\
      \ name,\nAnd a pure offering;\nFor My name shall be great among the nations,”\n\
      Says the Lord of hosts. \n"
    12: "¹² “But you profane it,\nIn that you say,\n‘The table of the Lord is defiled;\n\
      And its fruit, its food, is contemptible.’\n"
    13: "¹³ You also say,\n‘Oh, what a weariness!’\nAnd you sneer at it,”\nSays the\
      \ Lord of hosts.\n“And you bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick;\nThus you\
      \ bring an offering!\nShould I accept this from your hand?”\nSays the Lord.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “But cursed be the deceiver\nWho has in his flock a male,\nAnd takes a\
      \ vow,\nBut sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished—\nFor I am a great King,”\n\
      Says the Lord of hosts,\n“And My name is to be feared among the nations."
  2:
    1: "¹ “And now, O priests, this commandment is for you.\n"
    2: "² If you will not hear,\nAnd if you will not take it to heart,\nTo give glory\
      \ to My name,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“I will send a curse upon you,\nAnd\
      \ I will curse your blessings.\nYes, I have cursed them already,\nBecause you\
      \ do not take it to heart. \n"
    3: "³ “Behold, I will rebuke your descendants\nAnd spread refuse on your faces,\n\
      The refuse of your solemn feasts;\nAnd one will take you away with it.\n"
    4: "⁴ Then you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you,\nThat My covenant\
      \ with Levi may continue,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n"
    5: "⁵ “My covenant was with him, one of life and peace,\nAnd I gave them to him\
      \ that he might fear Me;\nSo he feared Me\nAnd was reverent before My name.\n"
    6: "⁶ The law of truth was in his mouth,\nAnd injustice was not found on his lips.\n\
      He walked with Me in peace and equity,\nAnd turned many away from iniquity.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ “For the lips of a priest should keep knowledge,\nAnd people should seek\
      \ the law from his mouth;\nFor he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.\n"
    8: "⁸ But you have departed from the way;\nYou have caused many to stumble at\
      \ the law.\nYou have corrupted the covenant of Levi,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base\nBefore all the people,\n\
      Because you have not kept My ways\nBut have shown partiality in the law.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Have we not all one Father?\nHas not one God created us?\nWhy do we deal\
      \ treacherously with one another\nBy profaning the covenant of the fathers?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Judah has dealt treacherously,\nAnd an abomination has been committed\
      \ in Israel and in Jerusalem,\nFor Judah has profaned\nThe Lord’s holy institution\
      \ which He loves:\nHe has married the daughter of a foreign god.\n"
    12: "¹² May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob\nThe man who does this, being\
      \ awake and aware,\nYet who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts! \n"
    13: "¹³ And this is the second thing you do:\nYou cover the altar of the Lord\
      \ with tears,\nWith weeping and crying;\nSo He does not regard the offering\
      \ anymore,\nNor receive it with goodwill from your hands.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yet you say, “For what reason?”\nBecause the Lord has been witness\nBetween\
      \ you and the wife of your youth,\nWith whom you have dealt treacherously;\n\
      Yet she is your companion\nAnd your wife by covenant.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But did He not make them one,\nHaving a remnant of the Spirit?\nAnd why\
      \ one?\nHe seeks godly offspring.\nTherefore take heed to your spirit,\nAnd\
      \ let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “For the Lord God of Israel says\nThat He hates divorce,\nFor it covers\
      \ one’s garment with violence,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n“Therefore take heed\
      \ to your spirit,\nThat you do not deal treacherously.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ You have wearied the Lord with your words;\nYet you say,\n“In what way\
      \ have we wearied Him?”\nIn that you say,\n“Everyone who does evil\nIs good\
      \ in the sight of the Lord,\nAnd He delights in them,”\nOr, “Where is the God\
      \ of justice?”"
  3:
    1: "¹ “Behold, I send My messenger,\nAnd he will prepare the way before Me.\n\
      And the Lord, whom you seek,\nWill suddenly come to His temple,\nEven the Messenger\
      \ of the covenant,\nIn whom you delight.\nBehold, He is coming,”\nSays the Lord\
      \ of hosts. \n"
    2: "² “But who can endure the day of His coming?\nAnd who can stand when He appears?\n\
      For He is like a refiner’s fire\nAnd like launderers’ soap.\n"
    3: "³ He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver;\nHe will purify the sons\
      \ of Levi,\nAnd purge them as gold and silver,\nThat they may offer to the Lord\n\
      An offering in righteousness. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem\nWill be pleasant to the Lord,\n\
      As in the days of old,\nAs in former years.\n"
    5: "⁵ And I will come near you for judgment;\nI will be a swift witness\nAgainst\
      \ sorcerers,\nAgainst adulterers,\nAgainst perjurers,\nAgainst those who exploit\
      \ wage earners and widows and orphans,\nAnd against those who turn away an alien—\n\
      Because they do not fear Me,”\nSays the Lord of hosts. \n"
    6: "⁶ “For I am the Lord, I do not change;\nTherefore you are not consumed, O\
      \ sons of Jacob.\n"
    7: "⁷ Yet from the days of your fathers\nYou have gone away from My ordinances\n\
      And have not kept them.\nReturn to Me, and I will return to you,”\nSays the\
      \ Lord of hosts.\n“But you said,\n‘In what way shall we return?’ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Will a man rob God?\nYet you have robbed Me!\nBut you say,\n‘In what way\
      \ have we robbed You?’\nIn tithes and offerings.\n"
    9: "⁹ You are cursed with a curse,\nFor you have robbed Me,\nEven this whole nation.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Bring all the tithes into the storehouse,\nThat there may be food in My\
      \ house,\nAnd try Me now in this,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“If I will not\
      \ open for you the windows of heaven\nAnd pour out for you such blessing\nThat\
      \ there will not be room enough to receive it. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,\nSo that he will not destroy\
      \ the fruit of your ground,\nNor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in\
      \ the field,”\nSays the Lord of hosts;\n"
    12: "¹² “And all nations will call you blessed,\nFor you will be a delightful\
      \ land,”\nSays the Lord of hosts. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Your words have been harsh against Me,”\nSays the Lord,\n“Yet you say,\n\
      ‘What have we spoken against You?’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You have said,\n‘It is useless to serve God;\nWhat profit is it that we\
      \ have kept His ordinance,\nAnd that we have walked as mourners\nBefore the\
      \ Lord of hosts?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So now we call the proud blessed,\nFor those who do wickedness are raised\
      \ up;\nThey even tempt God and go free.’ ” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another,\nAnd the Lord listened\
      \ and heard them;\nSo a book of remembrance was written before Him\nFor those\
      \ who fear the Lord\nAnd who meditate on His name. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “They shall be Mine,” says the Lord of hosts,\n“On the day that I make\
      \ them My jewels.\nAnd I will spare them\nAs a man spares his own son who serves\
      \ him.”\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then you shall again discern\nBetween the righteous and the wicked,\n\
      Between one who serves God\nAnd one who does not serve Him."
  4:
    1: "¹ “For behold, the day is coming,\nBurning like an oven,\nAnd all the proud,\
      \ yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.\nAnd the day which is coming shall\
      \ burn them up,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“That will leave them neither root\
      \ nor branch.\n"
    2: "² But to you who fear My name\nThe Sun of Righteousness shall arise\nWith\
      \ healing in His wings;\nAnd you shall go out\nAnd grow fat like stall-fed calves.\n"
    3: "³ You shall trample the wicked,\nFor they shall be ashes under the soles of\
      \ your feet\nOn the day that I do this,”\nSays the Lord of hosts. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Remember the Law of Moses, My servant,\nWhich I commanded him in Horeb\
      \ for all Israel,\nWith the statutes and judgments.\n"
    5: "⁵ Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet\nBefore the coming of the great\
      \ and dreadful day of the Lord.\n"
    6: "⁶ And he will turn\nThe hearts of the fathers to the children,\nAnd the hearts\
      \ of the children to their fathers,\nLest I come and strike the earth with a\
      \ curse.”"
