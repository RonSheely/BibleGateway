Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham,\
      \ Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Hear, all you peoples!\nListen, O earth, and all that is in it!\nLet the\
      \ Lord God be a witness against you,\nThe Lord from His holy temple. \n"
    3: "³ For behold, the Lord is coming out of His place;\nHe will come down\nAnd\
      \ tread on the high places of the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ The mountains will melt under Him,\nAnd the valleys will split\nLike wax\
      \ before the fire,\nLike waters poured down a steep place.\n"
    5: "⁵ All this is for the transgression of Jacob\nAnd for the sins of the house\
      \ of Israel.\nWhat is the transgression of Jacob?\nIs it not Samaria?\nAnd what\
      \ are the high places of Judah?\nAre they not Jerusalem? \n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the field,\nPlaces for\
      \ planting a vineyard;\nI will pour down her stones into the valley,\nAnd I\
      \ will uncover her foundations.\n"
    7: "⁷ All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,\nAnd all her pay as a harlot\
      \ shall be burned with the fire;\nAll her idols I will lay desolate,\nFor she\
      \ gathered it from the pay of a harlot,\nAnd they shall return to the pay of\
      \ a harlot.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore I will wail and howl,\nI will go stripped and naked;\nI will make\
      \ a wailing like the jackals\nAnd a mourning like the ostriches,\n"
    9: "⁹ For her wounds are incurable.\nFor it has come to Judah;\nIt has come to\
      \ the gate of My people—\nTo Jerusalem. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell it not in Gath,\nWeep not at all;\nIn Beth Aphrah\nRoll yourself\
      \ in the dust.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Pass by in naked shame, you inhabitant of Shaphir;\nThe inhabitant of\
      \ Zaanan does not go out.\nBeth Ezel mourns;\nIts place to stand is taken away\
      \ from you. \n"
    12: "¹² For the inhabitant of Maroth pined for good,\nBut disaster came down from\
      \ the Lord\nTo the gate of Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ O inhabitant of Lachish,\nHarness the chariot to the swift steeds\n(She\
      \ was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion),\nFor the transgressions\
      \ of Israel were found in you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore you shall give presents to Moresheth Gath;\nThe houses of Achzib\
      \ shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will yet bring an heir to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah;\nThe glory\
      \ of Israel shall come to Adullam.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Make yourself bald and cut off your hair,\nBecause of your precious children;\n\
      Enlarge your baldness like an eagle,\nFor they shall go from you into captivity."
  2:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who devise iniquity,\nAnd work out evil on their beds!\nAt\
      \ morning light they practice it,\nBecause it is in the power of their hand.\n"
    2: "² They covet fields and take them by violence,\nAlso houses, and seize them.\n\
      So they oppress a man and his house,\nA man and his inheritance. \n"
    3: "³ Therefore thus says the Lord:\n“Behold, against this family I am devising\
      \ disaster,\nFrom which you cannot remove your necks;\nNor shall you walk haughtily,\n\
      For this is an evil time.\n"
    4: "⁴ In that day one shall take up a proverb against you,\nAnd lament with a\
      \ bitter lamentation, saying:\n‘We are utterly destroyed!\nHe has changed the\
      \ heritage of my people;\nHow He has removed it from me!\nTo a turncoat He has\
      \ divided our fields.’ ” \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you will have no one to determine boundaries by lot\nIn the assembly\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Do not prattle,” you say to those who prophesy.\nSo they shall not prophesy\
      \ to you;\nThey shall not return insult for insult.\n"
    7: "⁷ You who are named the house of Jacob:\n“Is the Spirit of the Lord restricted?\n\
      Are these His doings?\nDo not My words do good\nTo him who walks uprightly?\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Lately My people have risen up as an enemy—\nYou pull off the robe with\
      \ the garment\nFrom those who trust you, as they pass by,\nLike men returned\
      \ from war.\n"
    9: "⁹ The women of My people you cast out\nFrom their pleasant houses;\nFrom their\
      \ children\nYou have taken away My glory forever. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Arise and depart,\nFor this is not your rest;\nBecause it is defiled,\
      \ it shall destroy,\nYes, with utter destruction.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If a man should walk in a false spirit\nAnd speak a lie, saying,\n‘I will\
      \ prophesy to you of wine and drink,’\nEven he would be the prattler of this\
      \ people. \n"
    12: "¹² “I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob,\nI will surely gather the\
      \ remnant of Israel;\nI will put them together like sheep of the fold,\nLike\
      \ a flock in the midst of their pasture;\nThey shall make a loud noise because\
      \ of so many people.\n"
    13: "¹³ The one who breaks open will come up before them;\nThey will break out,\n\
      Pass through the gate,\nAnd go out by it;\nTheir king will pass before them,\n\
      With the Lord at their head.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ And I said:\n“Hear now, O heads of Jacob,\nAnd you rulers of the house of\
      \ Israel:\nIs it not for you to know justice?\n"
    2: "² You who hate good and love evil;\nWho strip the skin from My people,\nAnd\
      \ the flesh from their bones;\n"
    3: "³ Who also eat the flesh of My people,\nFlay their skin from them,\nBreak\
      \ their bones,\nAnd chop them in pieces\nLike meat for the pot,\nLike flesh\
      \ in the caldron.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then they will cry to the Lord,\nBut He will not hear them;\nHe will even\
      \ hide His face from them at that time,\nBecause they have been evil in their\
      \ deeds. \n"
    5: "⁵ Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets\nWho make my people stray;\n\
      Who chant “Peace”\nWhile they chew with their teeth,\nBut who prepare war against\
      \ him\nWho puts nothing into their mouths:\n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore you shall have night without vision,\nAnd you shall have darkness\
      \ without divination;\nThe sun shall go down on the prophets,\nAnd the day shall\
      \ be dark for them.\n"
    7: "⁷ So the seers shall be ashamed,\nAnd the diviners abashed;\nIndeed they shall\
      \ all cover their lips;\nFor there is no answer from God.” \n"
    8: "⁸ But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord,\nAnd of justice\
      \ and might,\nTo declare to Jacob his transgression\nAnd to Israel his sin.\n"
    9: "⁹ Now hear this,\nYou heads of the house of Jacob\nAnd rulers of the house\
      \ of Israel,\nWho abhor justice\nAnd pervert all equity,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who build up Zion with bloodshed\nAnd Jerusalem with iniquity:\n"
    11: "¹¹ Her heads judge for a bribe,\nHer priests teach for pay,\nAnd her prophets\
      \ divine for money.\nYet they lean on the Lord, and say,\n“Is not the Lord among\
      \ us?\nNo harm can come upon us.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore because of you\nZion shall be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem\
      \ shall become heaps of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the temple\nLike the bare\
      \ hills of the forest."
  4:
    1: "¹ Now it shall come to pass in the latter days\nThat the mountain of the Lord’s\
      \ house\nShall be established on the top of the mountains,\nAnd shall be exalted\
      \ above the hills;\nAnd peoples shall flow to it.\n"
    2: "² Many nations shall come and say,\n“Come, and let us go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\nTo the house of the God of Jacob;\nHe will teach us His ways,\n\
      And we shall walk in His paths.”\nFor out of Zion the law shall go forth,\n\
      And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    3: "³ He shall judge between many peoples,\nAnd rebuke strong nations afar off;\n\
      They shall beat their swords into plowshares,\nAnd their spears into pruning\
      \ hooks;\nNation shall not lift up sword against nation,\nNeither shall they\
      \ learn war anymore. \n"
    4: "⁴ But everyone shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree,\nAnd no one\
      \ shall make them afraid;\nFor the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.\n"
    5: "⁵ For all people walk each in the name of his god,\nBut we will walk in the\
      \ name of the Lord our God\nForever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ “In that day,” says the Lord,\n“I will assemble the lame,\nI will gather\
      \ the outcast\nAnd those whom I have afflicted;\n"
    7: "⁷ I will make the lame a remnant,\nAnd the outcast a strong nation;\nSo the\
      \ Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion\nFrom now on, even forever.\n"
    8: "⁸ And you, O tower of the flock,\nThe stronghold of the daughter of Zion,\n\
      To you shall it come,\nEven the former dominion shall come,\nThe kingdom of\
      \ the daughter of Jerusalem.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Now why do you cry aloud?\nIs there no king in your midst?\nHas your counselor\
      \ perished?\nFor pangs have seized you like a woman in labor.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Be in pain, and labor to bring forth,\nO daughter of Zion,\nLike a woman\
      \ in birth pangs.\nFor now you shall go forth from the city,\nYou shall dwell\
      \ in the field,\nAnd to Babylon you shall go.\nThere you shall be delivered;\n\
      There the Lord will redeem you\nFrom the hand of your enemies. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Now also many nations have gathered against you,\nWho say, “Let her be\
      \ defiled,\nAnd let our eye look upon Zion.”\n"
    12: "¹² But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord,\nNor do they understand\
      \ His counsel;\nFor He will gather them like sheaves to the threshing floor.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ “Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion;\nFor I will make your horn iron,\n\
      And I will make your hooves bronze;\nYou shall beat in pieces many peoples;\n\
      I will consecrate their gain to the Lord,\nAnd their substance to the Lord of\
      \ the whole earth.”"
  5:
    1: "¹ Now gather yourself in troops,\nO daughter of troops;\nHe has laid siege\
      \ against us;\nThey will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,\nThough you are little among the thousands\
      \ of Judah,\nYet out of you shall come forth to Me\nThe One to be Ruler in Israel,\n\
      Whose goings forth are from of old,\nFrom everlasting.” \n"
    3: "³ Therefore He shall give them up,\nUntil the time that she who is in labor\
      \ has given birth;\nThen the remnant of His brethren\nShall return to the children\
      \ of Israel.\n"
    4: "⁴ And He shall stand and feed His flock\nIn the strength of the Lord,\nIn\
      \ the majesty of the name of the Lord His God;\nAnd they shall abide,\nFor now\
      \ He shall be great\nTo the ends of the earth;\n"
    5: "⁵ And this One shall be peace.\nWhen the Assyrian comes into our land,\nAnd\
      \ when he treads in our palaces,\nThen we will raise against him\nSeven shepherds\
      \ and eight princely men.\n"
    6: "⁶ They shall waste with the sword the land of Assyria,\nAnd the land of Nimrod\
      \ at its entrances;\nThus He shall deliver us from the Assyrian,\nWhen he comes\
      \ into our land\nAnd when he treads within our borders. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then the remnant of Jacob\nShall be in the midst of many peoples,\nLike\
      \ dew from the Lord,\nLike showers on the grass,\nThat tarry for no man\nNor\
      \ wait for the sons of men.\n"
    8: "⁸ And the remnant of Jacob\nShall be among the Gentiles,\nIn the midst of\
      \ many peoples,\nLike a lion among the beasts of the forest,\nLike a young lion\
      \ among flocks of sheep,\nWho, if he passes through,\nBoth treads down and tears\
      \ in pieces,\nAnd none can deliver.\n"
    9: "⁹ Your hand shall be lifted against your adversaries,\nAnd all your enemies\
      \ shall be cut off. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “And it shall be in that day,” says the Lord,\n“That I will cut off your\
      \ horses from your midst\nAnd destroy your chariots.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will cut off the cities of your land\nAnd throw down all your strongholds.\n"
    12: "¹² I will cut off sorceries from your hand,\nAnd you shall have no soothsayers.\n"
    13: "¹³ Your carved images I will also cut off,\nAnd your sacred pillars from\
      \ your midst;\nYou shall no more worship the work of your hands;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will pluck your wooden images from your midst;\nThus I will destroy\
      \ your cities.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury\nOn the nations that have\
      \ not heard.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Hear now what the Lord says:\n“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,\n\
      And let the hills hear your voice.\n"
    2: "² Hear, O you mountains, the Lord’s complaint,\nAnd you strong foundations\
      \ of the earth;\nFor the Lord has a complaint against His people,\nAnd He will\
      \ contend with Israel. \n"
    3: "³ “O My people, what have I done to you?\nAnd how have I wearied you?\nTestify\
      \ against Me.\n"
    4: "⁴ For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,\nI redeemed you from the house\
      \ of bondage;\nAnd I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.\n"
    5: "⁵ O My people, remember now\nWhat Balak king of Moab counseled,\nAnd what\
      \ Balaam the son of Beor answered him,\nFrom Acacia Grove to Gilgal,\nThat you\
      \ may know the righteousness of the Lord.” \n"
    6: "⁶ With what shall I come before the Lord,\nAnd bow myself before the High\
      \ God?\nShall I come before Him with burnt offerings,\nWith calves a year old?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,\nTen thousand rivers of\
      \ oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression,\nThe fruit of my body\
      \ for the sin of my soul? \n"
    8: "⁸ He has shown you, O man, what is good;\nAnd what does the Lord require of\
      \ you\nBut to do justly,\nTo love mercy,\nAnd to walk humbly with your God?\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord’s voice cries to the city—\nWisdom shall see Your name: \n“Hear\
      \ the rod!\nWho has appointed it?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness\nIn the house of the wicked,\n\
      And the short measure that is an abomination?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Shall I count pure those with the wicked scales,\nAnd with the bag of\
      \ deceitful weights?\n"
    12: "¹² For her rich men are full of violence,\nHer inhabitants have spoken lies,\n\
      And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Therefore I will also make you sick by striking you,\nBy making you desolate\
      \ because of your sins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You shall eat, but not be satisfied;\nHunger shall be in your midst.\n\
      You may carry some away, but shall not save them;\nAnd what you do rescue I\
      \ will give over to the sword. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “You shall sow, but not reap;\nYou shall tread the olives, but not anoint\
      \ yourselves with oil;\nAnd make sweet wine, but not drink wine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For the statutes of Omri are kept;\nAll the works of Ahab’s house are\
      \ done;\nAnd you walk in their counsels,\nThat I may make you a desolation,\n\
      And your inhabitants a hissing.\nTherefore you shall bear the reproach of My\
      \ people.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ Woe is me!\nFor I am like those who gather summer fruits,\nLike those who\
      \ glean vintage grapes;\nThere is no cluster to eat\nOf the first-ripe fruit\
      \ which my soul desires.\n"
    2: "² The faithful man has perished from the earth,\nAnd there is no one upright\
      \ among men.\nThey all lie in wait for blood;\nEvery man hunts his brother with\
      \ a net. \n"
    3: "³ That they may successfully do evil with both hands—\nThe prince asks for\
      \ gifts,\nThe judge seeks a bribe,\nAnd the great man utters his evil desire;\n\
      So they scheme together.\n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is like a brier;\nThe most upright is sharper than a thorn\
      \ hedge;\nThe day of your watchman and your punishment comes;\nNow shall be\
      \ their perplexity. \n"
    5: "⁵ Do not trust in a friend;\nDo not put your confidence in a companion;\n\
      Guard the doors of your mouth\nFrom her who lies in your bosom.\n"
    6: "⁶ For son dishonors father,\nDaughter rises against her mother,\nDaughter-in-law\
      \ against her mother-in-law;\nA man’s enemies are the men of his own household.\n"
    7: "⁷ Therefore I will look to the Lord;\nI will wait for the God of my salvation;\n\
      My God will hear me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Do not rejoice over me, my enemy;\nWhen I fall, I will arise;\nWhen I sit\
      \ in darkness,\nThe Lord will be a light to me.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bear the indignation of the Lord,\nBecause I have sinned against\
      \ Him,\nUntil He pleads my case\nAnd executes justice for me.\nHe will bring\
      \ me forth to the light;\nI will see His righteousness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then she who is my enemy will see,\nAnd shame will cover her who said\
      \ to me,\n“Where is the Lord your God?”\nMy eyes will see her;\nNow she will\
      \ be trampled down\nLike mud in the streets. \n"
    11: "¹¹ In the day when your walls are to be built,\nIn that day the decree shall\
      \ go far and wide.\n"
    12: "¹² In that day they shall come to you\nFrom Assyria and the fortified cities,\n\
      From the fortress to the River,\nFrom sea to sea,\nAnd mountain to mountain.\n"
    13: "¹³ Yet the land shall be desolate\nBecause of those who dwell in it,\nAnd\
      \ for the fruit of their deeds. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shepherd Your people with Your staff,\nThe flock of Your heritage,\nWho\
      \ dwell solitarily in a woodland,\nIn the midst of Carmel;\nLet them feed in\
      \ Bashan and Gilead,\nAs in days of old. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,\nI will show them\
      \ wonders.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might;\nThey shall put\
      \ their hand over their mouth;\nTheir ears shall be deaf.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They shall lick the dust like a serpent;\nThey shall crawl from their\
      \ holes like snakes of the earth.\nThey shall be afraid of the Lord our God,\n\
      And shall fear because of You.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like You,\nPardoning iniquity\nAnd passing over the transgression\
      \ of the remnant of His heritage? \nHe does not retain His anger forever,\n\
      Because He delights in mercy.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will again have compassion on us,\nAnd will subdue our iniquities.\
      \ \nYou will cast all our sins\nInto the depths of the sea.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You will give truth to Jacob\nAnd mercy to Abraham,\nWhich You have sworn\
      \ to our fathers\nFrom days of old."
