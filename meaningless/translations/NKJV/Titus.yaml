Titus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
      the faith of God’s elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with
      godliness, '
    2: '² in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time
      began, '
    3: "³ but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed\
      \ to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; \n"
    4: "⁴ To Titus, a true son in our common faith:\nGrace, mercy, and peace from\
      \ God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. \n"
    5: '⁵ For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things
      that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you— '
    6: '⁶ if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children
      not accused of dissipation or insubordination. '
    7: '⁷ For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not
      quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, '
    8: '⁸ but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, '
    9: "⁹ holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able,\
      \ by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially
      those of the circumcision, '
    11: '¹¹ whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things
      which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain. '
    12: '¹² One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars,
      evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” '
    13: '¹³ This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be
      sound in the faith, '
    14: '¹⁴ not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from
      the truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving
      nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled. '
    16: ¹⁶ They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable,
      disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.
  2:
    1: '¹ But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: '
    2: '² that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love,
      in patience; '
    3: '³ the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers,
      not given to much wine, teachers of good things— '
    4: '⁴ that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their
      children, '
    5: "⁵ to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands,\
      \ that the word of God may not be blasphemed. \n"
    6: '⁶ Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, '
    7: '⁷ in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine
      showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, '
    8: "⁸ sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be\
      \ ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you. \n"
    9: '⁹ Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing
      in all things, not answering back, '
    10: "¹⁰ not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the\
      \ doctrine of God our Savior in all things. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, '
    12: '¹² teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
      soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, '
    13: '¹³ looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and
      Savior Jesus Christ, '
    14: "¹⁴ who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed\
      \ and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise
      you.
  3:
    1: '¹ Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready
      for every good work, '
    2: '² to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to
      all men. '
    3: '³ For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
      various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one
      another. '
    4: '⁴ But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, '
    5: '⁵ not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy
      He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, '
    6: '⁶ whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, '
    7: "⁷ that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according\
      \ to the hope of eternal life. \n"
    8: "⁸ This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly,\
      \ that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works.\
      \ These things are good and profitable to men. \n"
    9: '⁹ But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about
      the law; for they are unprofitable and useless. '
    10: '¹⁰ Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition, '
    11: "¹¹ knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at
      Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. '
    13: '¹³ Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, that they
      may lack nothing. '
    14: "¹⁴ And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs,\
      \ that they may not be unfruitful. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.\n\
      Grace be with you all. Amen."
