      \ \n"
    2: "² God is jealous, and the Lord avenges;\nThe Lord avenges and is furious.\n\
      The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries,\nAnd He reserves wrath for\
      \ His enemies;\n"
    3: "³ The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,\nAnd will not at all acquit\
      \ the wicked. \nThe Lord has His way\nIn the whirlwind and in the storm,\nAnd\
      \ the clouds are the dust of His feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ He rebukes the sea and makes it dry,\nAnd dries up all the rivers.\nBashan\
      \ and Carmel wither,\nAnd the flower of Lebanon wilts.\n"

      \ His presence,\nYes, the world and all who dwell in it. \n"

      \ of His anger?\nHis fury is poured out like fire,\nAnd the rocks are thrown\
      \ down by Him. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord is good,\nA stronghold in the day of trouble;\nAnd He knows those\
      \ who trust in Him.\n"

      And darkness will pursue His enemies. \n"

      Affliction will not rise up a second time.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For while tangled like thorns,\nAnd while drunken like drunkards,\nThey\
      \ shall be devoured like stubble fully dried.\n"
    11: "¹¹ From you comes forth one\nWho plots evil against the Lord,\nA wicked counselor.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Thus says the Lord:\n“Though they are safe, and likewise many,\nYet in\
      \ this manner they will be cut down\nWhen he passes through.\nThough I have\
      \ afflicted you,\nI will afflict you no more;\n"
    13: "¹³ For now I will break off his yoke from you,\nAnd burst your bonds apart.”\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord has given a command concerning you:\n“Your name shall be perpetuated\
      \ no longer.\nOut of the house of your gods\nI will cut off the carved image\
      \ and the molded image.\nI will dig your grave,\nFor you are vile.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, on the mountains\nThe feet of him who brings good tidings,\nWho\
      \ proclaims peace!\nO Judah, keep your appointed feasts,\nPerform your vows.\n\

      \ Israel,\nFor the emptiers have emptied them out\nAnd ruined their vine branches.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ The shields of his mighty men are made red,\nThe valiant men are in scarlet.\n\
      The chariots come with flaming torches\nIn the day of his preparation,\nAnd\
      \ the spears are brandished.\n"
    4: "⁴ The chariots rage in the streets,\nThey jostle one another in the broad\
      \ roads;\nThey seem like torches,\nThey run like lightning. \n"
    5: "⁵ He remembers his nobles;\nThey stumble in their walk;\nThey make haste to\
      \ her walls,\nAnd the defense is prepared.\n"

    7: "⁷ It is decreed:\nShe shall be led away captive,\nShe shall be brought up;\n\
      And her maidservants shall lead her as with the voice of doves,\nBeating their\
      \ breasts. \n"
    8: "⁸ Though Nineveh of old was like a pool of water,\nNow they flee away.\n“Halt!\
      \ Halt!” they cry;\nBut no one turns back.\n"
    9: "⁹ Take spoil of silver!\nTake spoil of gold!\nThere is no end of treasure,\n\
      Or wealth of every desirable prize.\n"

      Much pain is in every side,\nAnd all their faces are drained of color. \n"

      \ lions,\nWhere the lion walked, the lioness and lion’s cub,\nAnd no one made\
      \ them afraid?\n"
    12: "¹² The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs,\nKilled for his lionesses,\n\
      Filled his caves with prey,\nAnd his dens with flesh. \n"
    13: ¹³ “Behold, I am against you,” says the Lord of hosts, “I will burn your chariots
      in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey
      from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall be heard no more.”
  3:

      \ never departs.\n"
    2: "² The noise of a whip\nAnd the noise of rattling wheels,\nOf galloping horses,\n\
      Of clattering chariots!\n"
    3: "³ Horsemen charge with bright sword and glittering spear.\nThere is a multitude\
      \ of slain,\nA great number of bodies,\nCountless corpses—\nThey stumble over\
      \ the corpses—\n"
    4: "⁴ Because of the multitude of harlotries of the seductive harlot,\nThe mistress\
      \ of sorceries,\nWho sells nations through her harlotries,\nAnd families through\
      \ her sorceries. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Behold, I am against you,” says the Lord of hosts;\n“I will lift your skirts\
      \ over your face,\nI will show the nations your nakedness,\nAnd the kingdoms\
      \ your shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will cast abominable filth upon you,\nMake you vile,\nAnd make you a spectacle.\n"
    7: "⁷ It shall come to pass that all who look upon you\nWill flee from you, and\
      \ say,\n‘Nineveh is laid waste!\nWho will bemoan her?’\nWhere shall I seek comforters\
      \ for you?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Are you better than No Amon\nThat was situated by the River,\nThat had the\
      \ waters around her,\nWhose rampart was the sea,\nWhose wall was the sea?\n"
    9: "⁹ Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength,\nAnd it was boundless;\nPut and Lubim\
      \ were your helpers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet she was carried away,\nShe went into captivity;\nHer young children\
      \ also were dashed to pieces\nAt the head of every street;\nThey cast lots for\
      \ her honorable men,\nAnd all her great men were bound in chains.\n"
    11: "¹¹ You also will be drunk;\nYou will be hidden;\nYou also will seek refuge\
      \ from the enemy. \n"
    12: "¹² All your strongholds are fig trees with ripened figs:\nIf they are shaken,\n\
      They fall into the mouth of the eater.\n"
    13: "¹³ Surely, your people in your midst are women!\nThe gates of your land are\
      \ wide open for your enemies;\nFire shall devour the bars of your gates. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Draw your water for the siege!\nFortify your strongholds!\nGo into the\
      \ clay and tread the mortar!\nMake strong the brick kiln!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ There the fire will devour you,\nThe sword will cut you off;\nIt will\
      \ eat you up like a locust. \nMake yourself many—like the locust!\nMake yourself\
      \ many—like the swarming locusts!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of heaven.\nThe\
      \ locust plunders and flies away.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your commanders are like swarming locusts,\nAnd your generals like great\
      \ grasshoppers,\nWhich camp in the hedges on a cold day;\nWhen the sun rises\
      \ they flee away,\nAnd the place where they are is not known. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria;\nYour nobles rest in the dust.\n\
      Your people are scattered on the mountains,\nAnd no one gathers them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your injury has no healing,\nYour wound is severe.\nAll who hear news\
      \ of you\nWill clap their hands over you,\nFor upon whom has not your wickedness\
      \ passed continually?"
