Colossians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,\
      \ \n"
    2: "² To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse:\nGrace\
      \ to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    3: '³ We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always
      for you, '
    4: '⁴ since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the
      saints; '
    5: '⁵ because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard
      before in the word of the truth of the gospel, '
    6: '⁶ which has come to you, as it has also in all the world, and is bringing
      forth fruit, as it is also among you since the day you heard and knew the grace
      of God in truth; '
    7: '⁷ as you also learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful
      minister of Christ on your behalf, '
    8: "⁸ who also declared to us your love in the Spirit. \n"
    9: '⁹ For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray
      for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in
      all wisdom and spiritual understanding; '
    10: '¹⁰ that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful
      in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; '
    11: '¹¹ strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all
      patience and longsuffering with joy; '
    12: '¹² giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the
      inheritance of the saints in the light. '
    13: '¹³ He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the
      kingdom of the Son of His love, '
    14: "¹⁴ in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. '
    16: '¹⁶ For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on
      earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities
      or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. '
    17: '¹⁷ And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. '
    18: "¹⁸ And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the\
      \ firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, '
    20: "²⁰ and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things\
      \ on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works,
      yet now He has reconciled '
    22: '²² in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless,
      and above reproach in His sight— '
    23: "²³ if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not\
      \ moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached\
      \ to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister. \n"
    24: '²⁴ I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is
      lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the
      church, '
    25: '²⁵ of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which
      was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God, '
    26: '²⁶ the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but
      now has been revealed to His saints. '
    27: '²⁷ To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this
      mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. '
    28: '²⁸ Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,
      that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. '
    29: ²⁹ To this end I also labor, striving according to His working which works
      in me mightily.
  2:
    1: '¹ For I want you to know what a great conflict I have for you and those in
      Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, '
    2: '² that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining
      to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the
      mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ, '
    3: "³ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now this I say lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words. '
    5: "⁵ For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing\
      \ to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. \n"
    6: '⁶ As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, '
    7: "⁷ rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been\
      \ taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving. \n"
    8: '⁸ Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according
      to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and
      not according to Christ. '
    9: '⁹ For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; '
    10: "¹⁰ and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands,
      by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, '
    12: '¹² buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through
      faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. '
    13: '¹³ And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your
      flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses, '
    14: '¹⁴ having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us,
      which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed
      it to the cross. '
    15: "¹⁵ Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle\
      \ of them, triumphing over them in it. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or
      a new moon or sabbaths, '
    17: '¹⁷ which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ. '
    18: '¹⁸ Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in false humility
      and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly
      puffed up by his fleshly mind, '
    19: "¹⁹ and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and\
      \ knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from\
      \ God. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world,
      why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations— '
    21: '²¹ “Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,” '
    22: '²² which all concern things which perish with the using—according to the
      commandments and doctrines of men? '
    23: ²³ These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion,
      false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence
      of the flesh.
  3:
    1: '¹ If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above,
      where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. '
    2: '² Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. '
    3: '³ For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. '
    4: "⁴ When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him\
      \ in glory. \n"
    5: '⁵ Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication,
      uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. '
    6: '⁶ Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, '
    7: "⁷ in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them. \n"
    8: '⁸ But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
      filthy language out of your mouth. '
    9: '⁹ Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, '
    10: '¹⁰ and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the
      image of Him who created him, '
    11: "¹¹ where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian,\
      \ Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all. \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies,
      kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; '
    13: '¹³ bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint
      against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. '
    14: '¹⁴ But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection. '
    15: '¹⁵ And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called
      in one body; and be thankful. '
    16: '¹⁶ Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and
      admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
      grace in your hearts to the Lord. '
    17: "¹⁷ And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,\
      \ giving thanks to God the Father through Him. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged. \n"
    22: '²² Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh,
      not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. '
    23: '²³ And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, '
    24: '²⁴ knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance;
      for you serve the Lord Christ. '
    25: ²⁵ But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is
      no partiality.
  4:
    1: "¹ Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you\
      \ also have a Master in heaven. \n"
    2: '² Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving; '
    3: '³ meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the
      word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains, '
    4: "⁴ that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. \n"
    5: '⁵ Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. '
    6: "⁶ Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know\
      \ how you ought to answer each one. \n"
    7: '⁷ Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the
      Lord, will tell you all the news about me. '
    8: '⁸ I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances
      and comfort your hearts, '
    9: "⁹ with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will\
      \ make known to you all things which are happening here. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas
      (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him), '
    11: "¹¹ and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the\
      \ kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort\
      \ to me. \n"
    12: '¹² Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always
      laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete
      in all the will of God. '
    13: '¹³ For I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who
      are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis. '
    14: '¹⁴ Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that\
      \ is in his house. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the
      church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. '
    17: "¹⁷ And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received\
      \ in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.” \n"
    18: ¹⁸ This salutation by my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with
      you. Amen.
