Nehemiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah:\nIn the month of Kislev in the twentieth\
      \ year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, "
    2: "² Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned\
      \ them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about\
      \ Jerusalem. \n"
    3: "³ They said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the province\
      \ are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and\
      \ its gates have been burned with fire.” \n"
    4: '⁴ When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned
      and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. '
    5: "⁵ Then I said:\n“Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps\
      \ his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, "
    6: '⁶ let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant
      is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel.
      I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father’s family, have
      committed against you. '
    7: "⁷ We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands,\
      \ decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are
      unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, '
    9: "⁹ but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people\
      \ are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them\
      \ to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.’ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great
      strength and your mighty hand. '
    11: "¹¹ Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and\
      \ to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your\
      \ servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.”\n\
      I was cupbearer to the king."
  2:
    1: '¹ In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine
      was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been
      sad in his presence before, '
    2: "² so the king asked me, “Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill?\
      \ This can be nothing but sadness of heart.”\nI was very much afraid, "
    3: "³ but I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not\
      \ look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its\
      \ gates have been destroyed by fire?” \n"
    4: "⁴ The king said to me, “What is it you want?”\nThen I prayed to the God of\
      \ heaven, "
    5: "⁵ and I answered the king, “If it pleases the king and if your servant has\
      \ found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors\
      \ are buried so that I can rebuild it.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long will\
      \ your journey take, and when will you get back?” It pleased the king to send\
      \ me; so I set a time. \n"
    7: '⁷ I also said to him, “If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors
      of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive
      in Judah? '
    8: '⁸ And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give
      me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the
      city wall and for the residence I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand
      of my God was on me, the king granted my requests. '
    9: "⁹ So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters.\
      \ The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about\
      \ this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare\
      \ of the Israelites. \n"
    11: '¹¹ I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days '
    12: "¹² I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what\
      \ my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with\
      \ me except the one I was riding on. \n"
    13: '¹³ By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and
      the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down,
      and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there
      was not enough room for my mount to get through; '
    15: '¹⁵ so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned
      back and reentered through the Valley Gate. '
    16: "¹⁶ The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because\
      \ as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials\
      \ or any others who would be doing the work. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in
      ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall
      of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.” '
    18: "¹⁸ I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the\
      \ king had said to me.\nThey replied, “Let us start rebuilding.” So they began\
      \ this good work. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem\
      \ the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What is this you are\
      \ doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the king?” \n"
    20: ²⁰ I answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We
      his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem
      or any claim or historic right to it.”
  3:
    1: '¹ Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt
      the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far
      as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of
      Hananel. '
    2: "² The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zakkur son of Imri built\
      \ next to them. \n"
    3: '³ The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams
      and put its doors and bolts and bars in place. '
    4: '⁴ Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next
      to him Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and next
      to him Zadok son of Baana also made repairs. '
    5: "⁵ The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would\
      \ not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors. \n"
    6: '⁶ The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son
      of Besodeiah. They laid its beams and put its doors with their bolts and bars
      in place. '
    7: '⁷ Next to them, repairs were made by men from Gibeon and Mizpah—Melatiah of
      Gibeon and Jadon of Meronoth—places under the authority of the governor of Trans-Euphrates. '
    8: '⁸ Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the next section;
      and Hananiah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs next to that. They restored
      Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. '
    9: '⁹ Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the
      next section. '
    10: '¹⁰ Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house,
      and Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs next to him. '
    11: '¹¹ Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another
      section and the Tower of the Ovens. '
    12: "¹² Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired\
      \ the next section with the help of his daughters. \n"
    13: "¹³ The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They\
      \ rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place. They also\
      \ repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Rekab, ruler of the district\
      \ of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars\
      \ in place. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Kol-Hozeh, ruler of the
      district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it over and putting its doors and
      bolts and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam, by
      the King’s Garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David. '
    16: "¹⁶ Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur,\
      \ made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial\
      \ pool and the House of the Heroes. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Next to him, the repairs were made by the Levites under Rehum son of Bani.
      Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs
      for his district. '
    18: '¹⁸ Next to him, the repairs were made by their fellow Levites under Binnui
      son of Henadad, ruler of the other half-district of Keilah. '
    19: '¹⁹ Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section,
      from a point facing the ascent to the armory as far as the angle of the wall. '
    20: '²⁰ Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section,
      from the angle to the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest. '
    21: "²¹ Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another\
      \ section, from the entrance of Eliashib’s house to the end of it. \n"
    22: '²² The repairs next to him were made by the priests from the surrounding
      region. '
    23: '²³ Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house;
      and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs
      beside his house. '
    24: '²⁴ Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah’s
      house to the angle and the corner, '
    25: '²⁵ and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the angle and the tower projecting
      from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son
      of Parosh '
    26: '²⁶ and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs up to
      a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower. '
    27: "²⁷ Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great\
      \ projecting tower to the wall of Ophel. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Above the Horse Gate, the priests made repairs, each in front of his own
      house. '
    29: '²⁹ Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Next
      to him, Shemaiah son of Shekaniah, the guard at the East Gate, made repairs. '
    30: '³⁰ Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph,
      repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs
      opposite his living quarters. '
    31: '³¹ Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the
      house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate,
      and as far as the room above the corner; '
    32: ³² and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths
      and merchants made repairs.
  4:
    1: '¹ When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and
      was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews, '
    2: "² and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said,\
      \ “What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they\
      \ offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back\
      \ to life from those heaps of rubble—burned as they are?” \n"
    3: "³ Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, “What they are building—even\
      \ a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their
      own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. '
    5: "⁵ Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for\
      \ they have thrown insults in the face of the builders. \n"
    6: "⁶ So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people\
      \ worked with all their heart. \n"
    7: '⁷ But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod
      heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps
      were being closed, they were very angry. '
    8: '⁸ They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up
      trouble against it. '
    9: "⁹ But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is\
      \ giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Also our enemies said, “Before they know it or see us, we will be right\
      \ there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.” \n"
    12: "¹² Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever\
      \ you turn, they will attack us.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the
      wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears
      and bows. '
    14: "¹⁴ After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials\
      \ and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who\
      \ is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters,\
      \ your wives and your homes.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had\
      \ frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were
      equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves
      behind all the people of Judah '
    17: '¹⁷ who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work
      with one hand and held a weapon in the other, '
    18: "¹⁸ and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But\
      \ the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The
      work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other
      along the wall. '
    20: "²⁰ Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will\
      \ fight for us!” \n"
    21: '²¹ So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first
      light of dawn till the stars came out. '
    22: '²² At that time I also said to the people, “Have every man and his helper
      stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and
      as workers by day.” '
    23: ²³ Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our
      clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.
  5:
    1: '¹ Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews. '
    2: "² Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order\
      \ for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.” \n"
    3: "³ Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our\
      \ homes to get grain during the famine.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Still others were saying, “We have had to borrow money to pay the king’s
      tax on our fields and vineyards. '
    5: "⁵ Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though\
      \ our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters\
      \ to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless,\
      \ because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry. '
    7: '⁷ I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I
      told them, “You are charging your own people interest!” So I called together
      a large meeting to deal with them '
    8: "⁸ and said: “As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were\
      \ sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to\
      \ be sold back to us!” They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in
      the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies? '
    10: '¹⁰ I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain.
      But let us stop charging interest! '
    11: "¹¹ Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and\
      \ houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money,\
      \ grain, new wine and olive oil.” \n"
    12: "¹² “We will give it back,” they said. “And we will not demand anything more\
      \ from them. We will do as you say.”\nThen I summoned the priests and made the\
      \ nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. "
    13: "¹³ I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake\
      \ out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise.\
      \ So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!”\nAt this the whole assembly\
      \ said, “Amen,” and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed
      to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve
      years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. '
    15: '¹⁵ But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on
      the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and
      wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence
      for God I did not act like that. '
    16: "¹⁶ Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled\
      \ there for the work; we did not acquire any land. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as
      well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. '
    18: "¹⁸ Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me,\
      \ and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all\
      \ this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands\
      \ were heavy on these people. \n"
    19: ¹⁹ Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
  6:
    1: '¹ When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our
      enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to
      that time I had not set the doors in the gates— '
    2: "² Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in\
      \ one of the villages on the plain of Ono.”\nBut they were scheming to harm\
      \ me; "
    3: '³ so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great
      project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go
      down to you?” '
    4: "⁴ Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the\
      \ same answer. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message,
      and in his hand was an unsealed letter '
    6: "⁶ in which was written:\n“It is reported among the nations—and Geshem says\
      \ it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you\
      \ are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about\
      \ to become their king "
    7: "⁷ and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in\
      \ Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the\
      \ king; so come, let us meet together.” \n"
    8: "⁸ I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you\
      \ are just making it up out of your head.” \n"
    9: "⁹ They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too\
      \ weak for the work, and it will not be completed.”\nBut I prayed, “Now strengthen\
      \ my hands.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel,\
      \ who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside\
      \ the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill\
      \ you—by night they are coming to kill you.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me
      go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!” '
    12: '¹² I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against
      me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. '
    13: "¹³ He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing\
      \ this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done;
      remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have
      been trying to intimidate me. '
    15: "¹⁵ So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were\
      \ afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work\
      \ had been done with the help of our God. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah,
      and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. '
    18: '¹⁸ For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah
      son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son
      of Berekiah. '
    19: ¹⁹ Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him
      what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
  7:
    1: '¹ After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers,
      the musicians and the Levites were appointed. '
    2: '² I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the
      commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more
      than most people do. '
    3: "³ I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun\
      \ is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors\
      \ and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their\
      \ posts and some near their own houses.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and
      the houses had not yet been rebuilt. '
    5: "⁵ So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and\
      \ the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record\
      \ of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the
      exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned
      to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town, '
    7: "⁷ in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani,\
      \ Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum and Baanah):\nThe list of the\
      \ men of Israel: "

  9:
    1: '¹ On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together,

    4: '⁴ Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah,

    5: "⁵ And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah\

    13: '¹³ “You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave
      them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands
      that are good. '
    14: '¹⁴ You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees
      and laws through your servant Moses. '

      not obey your commands. '
    17: '¹⁷ They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed

      them, '
    18: "¹⁸ even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, ‘This\

    20: '²⁰ You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your
      manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. '

      \ their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen. \n"
    22: '²² “You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest

      them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess. '
    24: '²⁴ Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before

      as they pleased. '
    25: "²⁵ They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession\

    26: '²⁶ “But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their
      backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to
      turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies. '

      \ But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard\

      turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. '
    30: '³⁰ For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them
      through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you gave them into the

    22: '²² The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the
      son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mika. Uzzi was one of Asaph’s
      descendants, who were the musicians responsible for the service of the house
      of God. '

      who, together with his associates, was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. '
    9: "⁹ Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood opposite them in the services.\

    10: '¹⁰ Joshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib

    12: "¹² In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families:\n\

      and Jaddua, as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius
      the Persian. '
    23: '²³ The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan
      son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals. '
    24: "²⁴ And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of\
      \ Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and\
      \ thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David\
      \ the man of God. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers
      who guarded the storerooms at the gates. '
    26: "²⁶ They served in the days of Joiakim son of Joshua, the son of Jozadak,\
      \ and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the teacher\
      \ of the Law. \n"
    27: '²⁷ At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out
      from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the
      dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and
      lyres. '
    28: '²⁸ The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem—from
      the villages of the Netophathites, '
    29: '²⁹ from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the musicians
      had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. '
    30: "³⁰ When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they\
      \ purified the people, the gates and the wall. \n"
    31: '³¹ I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two
      large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of the wall to the right,
      toward the Dung Gate. '
    32: '³² Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, '
    33: '³³ along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, '
    34: '³⁴ Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, '
    35: '³⁵ as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan,
      the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zakkur,
      the son of Asaph, '
    36: '³⁶ and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel,
      Judah and Hanani—with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God.
      Ezra the teacher of the Law led the procession. '
    37: "³⁷ At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City\
      \ of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the site of David’s palace\
      \ to the Water Gate on the east. \n"
    38: '³⁸ The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them
      on top of the wall, together with half the people—past the Tower of the Ovens
      to the Broad Wall, '
    39: "³⁹ over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower\
      \ of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the\
      \ Gate of the Guard they stopped. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of
      God; so did I, together with half the officials, '
    41: '⁴¹ as well as the priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai,
      Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets— '
    42: '⁴² and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam
      and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. '
    43: "⁴³ And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had\
      \ given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing\
      \ in Jerusalem could be heard far away. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for
      the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns
      they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for
      the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests
      and Levites. '
    45: '⁴⁵ They performed the service of their God and the service of purification,
      as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David
      and his son Solomon. '
    46: '⁴⁶ For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors
      for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. '
    47: ⁴⁷ So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the
      daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the
      portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the
      descendants of Aaron.
  13:
    1: '¹ On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people
      and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted
      into the assembly of God, '
    2: '² because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired
      Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into
      a blessing.) '
    3: "³ When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of\
      \ foreign descent. \n"
    4: '⁴ Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms
      of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah, '
    5: "⁵ and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain\
      \ offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new\
      \ wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers,\
      \ as well as the contributions for the priests. \n"
    6: '⁶ But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second
      year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later
      I asked his permission '
    7: '⁷ and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib
      had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God. '
    8: '⁸ I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the
      room. '
    9: "⁹ I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment\
      \ of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been
      given to them, and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service
      had gone back to their own fields. '
    11: "¹¹ So I rebuked the officials and asked them, “Why is the house of God neglected?”\
      \ Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts. \n"
    12: '¹² All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil into the
      storerooms. '
    13: "¹³ I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah\
      \ in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah,\
      \ their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made\
      \ responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully\
      \ done for the house of my God and its services. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath
      and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes,
      figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem
      on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day. '
    16: '¹⁶ People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all
      kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people
      of Judah. '
    17: '¹⁷ I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this wicked thing
      you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day? '
    18: "¹⁸ Didn’t your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all\
      \ this calamity on us and on this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against\
      \ Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath,
      I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I
      stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in
      on the Sabbath day. '
    20: '²⁰ Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the
      night outside Jerusalem. '
    21: '²¹ But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If
      you do this again, I will arrest you.” From that time on they no longer came
      on the Sabbath. '
    22: "²² Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the\
      \ gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.\nRemember me for this also, my\
      \ God, and show mercy to me according to your great love. \n"
    23: '²³ Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from
      Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. '
    24: '²⁴ Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of
      one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah. '
    25: '²⁵ I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men
      and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God’s name and said:
      “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to
      take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves. '
    26: '²⁶ Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel
      sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his
      God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by
      foreign women. '
    27: "²⁷ Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and\
      \ are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?” \n"
    28: "²⁸ One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law\
      \ to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me. \n"
    29: "²⁹ Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the\
      \ covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites. \n"
    30: '³⁰ So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned
      them duties, each to his own task. '
    31: "³¹ I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and\
      \ for the firstfruits.\nRemember me with favor, my God."
