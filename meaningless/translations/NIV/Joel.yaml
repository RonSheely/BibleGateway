Joel:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel. \n"
    2: "² Hear this, you elders;\n    listen, all who live in the land.\nHas anything\
      \ like this ever happened in your days\n    or in the days of your ancestors?\n"
    3: "³ Tell it to your children,\n    and let your children tell it to their children,\n\
      \    and their children to the next generation.\n"
    4: "⁴ What the locust swarm has left\n    the great locusts have eaten;\nwhat\
      \ the great locusts have left\n    the young locusts have eaten;\nwhat the young\
      \ locusts have left\n    other locusts have eaten. \n"
    5: "⁵ Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!\n    Wail, all you drinkers of wine;\n\
      wail because of the new wine,\n    for it has been snatched from your lips.\n"
    6: "⁶ A nation has invaded my land,\n    a mighty army without number;\nit has\
      \ the teeth of a lion,\n    the fangs of a lioness.\n"
    7: "⁷ It has laid waste my vines\n    and ruined my fig trees.\nIt has stripped\
      \ off their bark\n    and thrown it away,\n    leaving their branches white.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth\n    grieving for the betrothed of her\
      \ youth.\n"
    9: "⁹ Grain offerings and drink offerings\n    are cut off from the house of the\
      \ Lord.\nThe priests are in mourning,\n    those who minister before the Lord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The fields are ruined,\n    the ground is dried up;\nthe grain is destroyed,\n\
      \    the new wine is dried up,\n    the olive oil fails. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Despair, you farmers,\n    wail, you vine growers;\ngrieve for the wheat\
      \ and the barley,\n    because the harvest of the field is destroyed.\n"
    12: "¹² The vine is dried up\n    and the fig tree is withered;\nthe pomegranate,\
      \ the palm and the apple tree—\n    all the trees of the field—are dried up.\n\
      Surely the people’s joy\n    is withered away. \n"
    13: "¹³ Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn;\n    wail, you who minister\
      \ before the altar.\nCome, spend the night in sackcloth,\n    you who minister\
      \ before my God;\nfor the grain offerings and drink offerings\n    are withheld\
      \ from the house of your God.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Declare a holy fast;\n    call a sacred assembly.\nSummon the elders\n\
      \    and all who live in the land\nto the house of the Lord your God,\n    and\
      \ cry out to the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Alas for that day!\n    For the day of the Lord is near;\n    it will\
      \ come like destruction from the Almighty. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Has not the food been cut off\n    before our very eyes—\njoy and gladness\n\
      \    from the house of our God?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seeds are shriveled\n    beneath the clods.\nThe storehouses are in\
      \ ruins,\n    the granaries have been broken down,\n    for the grain has dried\
      \ up.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ How the cattle moan!\n    The herds mill about\nbecause they have no pasture;\n\
      \    even the flocks of sheep are suffering. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ To you, Lord, I call,\n    for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness\n\
      \    and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Even the wild animals pant for you;\n    the streams of water have dried\
      \ up\n    and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness."
  2:
    1: "¹ Blow the trumpet in Zion;\n    sound the alarm on my holy hill.\nLet all\
      \ who live in the land tremble,\n    for the day of the Lord is coming.\nIt\
      \ is close at hand—\n"
    2: "²     a day of darkness and gloom,\n    a day of clouds and blackness.\nLike\
      \ dawn spreading across the mountains\n    a large and mighty army comes,\n\
      such as never was in ancient times\n    nor ever will be in ages to come. \n"
    3: "³ Before them fire devours,\n    behind them a flame blazes.\nBefore them\
      \ the land is like the garden of Eden,\n    behind them, a desert waste—\n \
      \   nothing escapes them.\n"
    4: "⁴ They have the appearance of horses;\n    they gallop along like cavalry.\n"
    5: "⁵ With a noise like that of chariots\n    they leap over the mountaintops,\n\
      like a crackling fire consuming stubble,\n    like a mighty army drawn up for\
      \ battle. \n"
    6: "⁶ At the sight of them, nations are in anguish;\n    every face turns pale.\n"
    7: "⁷ They charge like warriors;\n    they scale walls like soldiers.\nThey all\
      \ march in line,\n    not swerving from their course.\n"
    8: "⁸ They do not jostle each other;\n    each marches straight ahead.\nThey plunge\
      \ through defenses\n    without breaking ranks.\n"
    9: "⁹ They rush upon the city;\n    they run along the wall.\nThey climb into\
      \ the houses;\n    like thieves they enter through the windows. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Before them the earth shakes,\n    the heavens tremble,\nthe sun and moon\
      \ are darkened,\n    and the stars no longer shine.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord thunders\n    at the head of his army;\nhis forces are beyond\
      \ number,\n    and mighty is the army that obeys his command.\nThe day of the\
      \ Lord is great;\n    it is dreadful.\n    Who can endure it? \n"
    12: "¹² “Even now,” declares the Lord,\n    “return to me with all your heart,\n\
      \    with fasting and weeping and mourning.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Rend your heart\n    and not your garments.\nReturn to the Lord your God,\n\
      \    for he is gracious and compassionate,\nslow to anger and abounding in love,\n\
      \    and he relents from sending calamity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who knows? He may turn and relent\n    and leave behind a blessing—\n\
      grain offerings and drink offerings\n    for the Lord your God. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Blow the trumpet in Zion,\n    declare a holy fast,\n    call a sacred\
      \ assembly.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Gather the people,\n    consecrate the assembly;\nbring together the elders,\n\
      \    gather the children,\n    those nursing at the breast.\nLet the bridegroom\
      \ leave his room\n    and the bride her chamber.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let the priests, who minister before the Lord,\n    weep between the portico\
      \ and the altar.\nLet them say, “Spare your people, Lord.\n    Do not make your\
      \ inheritance an object of scorn,\n    a byword among the nations.\nWhy should\
      \ they say among the peoples,\n    ‘Where is their God?’” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Lord was jealous for his land\n    and took pity on his people.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord replied to them:\n“I am sending you grain, new wine and olive\
      \ oil,\n    enough to satisfy you fully;\nnever again will I make you\n    an\
      \ object of scorn to the nations. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “I will drive the northern horde far from you,\n    pushing it into a\
      \ parched and barren land;\nits eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea\n \
      \   and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea.\nAnd its stench will go\
      \ up;\n    its smell will rise.”\nSurely he has done great things!\n"
    21: "²¹     Do not be afraid, land of Judah;\n    be glad and rejoice.\nSurely\
      \ the Lord has done great things!\n"
    22: "²²     Do not be afraid, you wild animals,\n    for the pastures in the wilderness\
      \ are becoming green.\nThe trees are bearing their fruit;\n    the fig tree\
      \ and the vine yield their riches.\n"
    23: "²³ Be glad, people of Zion,\n    rejoice in the Lord your God,\nfor he has\
      \ given you the autumn rains\n    because he is faithful.\nHe sends you abundant\
      \ showers,\n    both autumn and spring rains, as before.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The threshing floors will be filled with grain;\n    the vats will overflow\
      \ with new wine and oil. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten—\n    the great\
      \ locust and the young locust,\n    the other locusts and the locust swarm—\n\
      my great army that I sent among you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will have plenty to eat, until you are full,\n    and you will praise\
      \ the name of the Lord your God,\n    who has worked wonders for you;\nnever\
      \ again will my people be shamed.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Then you will know that I am in Israel,\n    that I am the Lord your God,\n\
      \    and that there is no other;\nnever again will my people be shamed. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “And afterward,\n    I will pour out my Spirit on all people.\nYour sons\
      \ and daughters will prophesy,\n    your old men will dream dreams,\n    your\
      \ young men will see visions.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Even on my servants, both men and women,\n    I will pour out my Spirit\
      \ in those days.\n"
    30: "³⁰ I will show wonders in the heavens\n    and on the earth,\n    blood and\
      \ fire and billows of smoke.\n"
    31: "³¹ The sun will be turned to darkness\n    and the moon to blood\n    before\
      \ the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\n"
    32: "³² And everyone who calls\n    on the name of the Lord will be saved;\nfor\
      \ on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\n    there will be deliverance,\n    as the\
      \ Lord has said,\neven among the survivors\n    whom the Lord calls."
  3:
    1: "¹ “In those days and at that time,\n    when I restore the fortunes of Judah\
      \ and Jerusalem,\n"
    2: "² I will gather all nations\n    and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.\n\
      There I will put them on trial\n    for what they did to my inheritance, my\
      \ people Israel,\nbecause they scattered my people among the nations\n    and\
      \ divided up my land.\n"
    3: "³ They cast lots for my people\n    and traded boys for prostitutes;\n   \
      \ they sold girls for wine to drink. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Now what have you against me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia?
      Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I
      will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done. '
    5: '⁵ For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to
      your temples. '
    6: "⁶ You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might\
      \ send them far from their homeland. \n"
    7: '⁷ “See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them,
      and I will return on your own heads what you have done. '
    8: "⁸ I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will\
      \ sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.” The Lord has spoken. \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim this among the nations:\n    Prepare for war!\nRouse the warriors!\n\
      \    Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Beat your plowshares into swords\n    and your pruning hooks into spears.\n\
      Let the weakling say,\n    “I am strong!”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Come quickly, all you nations from every side,\n    and assemble there.\n\
      Bring down your warriors, Lord! \n"
    12: "¹² “Let the nations be roused;\n    let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat,\n\
      for there I will sit\n    to judge all the nations on every side.\n"
    13: "¹³ Swing the sickle,\n    for the harvest is ripe.\nCome, trample the grapes,\n\
      \    for the winepress is full\n    and the vats overflow—\nso great is their\
      \ wickedness!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Multitudes, multitudes\n    in the valley of decision!\nFor the day of\
      \ the Lord is near\n    in the valley of decision.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sun and moon will be darkened,\n    and the stars no longer shine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord will roar from Zion\n    and thunder from Jerusalem;\n    the\
      \ earth and the heavens will tremble.\nBut the Lord will be a refuge for his\
      \ people,\n    a stronghold for the people of Israel. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Then you will know that I, the Lord your God,\n    dwell in Zion, my\
      \ holy hill.\nJerusalem will be holy;\n    never again will foreigners invade\
      \ her. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “In that day the mountains will drip new wine,\n    and the hills will\
      \ flow with milk;\n    all the ravines of Judah will run with water.\nA fountain\
      \ will flow out of the Lord’s house\n    and will water the valley of acacias.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ But Egypt will be desolate,\n    Edom a desert waste,\nbecause of violence\
      \ done to the people of Judah,\n    in whose land they shed innocent blood.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Judah will be inhabited forever\n    and Jerusalem through all generations.\n"
    21: "²¹ Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged?\n    No, I will not.”\n\
      The Lord dwells in Zion!"
