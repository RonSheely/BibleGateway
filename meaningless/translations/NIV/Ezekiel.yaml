Ezekiel:
  1:
    1: "¹ In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was\
      \ among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions\
      \ of God. \n"
    2: '² On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— '
    3: "³ the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the\
      \ Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of the Lord was\
      \ on him. \n"
    4: '⁴ I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud
      with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the
      fire looked like glowing metal, '
    5: '⁵ and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance
      their form was human, '
    6: '⁶ but each of them had four faces and four wings. '
    7: '⁷ Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed
      like burnished bronze. '
    8: '⁸ Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of
      them had faces and wings, '
    9: "⁹ and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight\
      \ ahead; they did not turn as they moved. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human
      being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the
      face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. '
    11: '¹¹ Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each
      wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings
      covering its body. '
    12: '¹² Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would
      go, without turning as they went. '
    13: '¹³ The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire
      or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright,
      and lightning flashed out of it. '
    14: "¹⁴ The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside
      each creature with its four faces. '
    16: '¹⁶ This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like
      topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting
      a wheel. '
    17: '¹⁷ As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures
      faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. '
    18: "¹⁸ Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes\
      \ all around. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when
      the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. '
    20: '²⁰ Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise
      along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. '
    21: "²¹ When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still,\
      \ they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels\
      \ rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the\
      \ wheels. \n"
    22: '²² Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something
      like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. '
    23: '²³ Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and
      each had two wings covering its body. '
    24: "²⁴ When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar\
      \ of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army.\
      \ When they stood still, they lowered their wings. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they
      stood with lowered wings. '
    26: '²⁶ Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis
      lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. '
    27: '²⁷ I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing
      metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and
      brilliant light surrounded him. '
    28: "²⁸ Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was\
      \ the radiance around him.\nThis was the appearance of the likeness of the glory\
      \ of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one\
      \ speaking."
  2:
    1: '¹ He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” '
    2: "² As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard\
      \ him speaking to me. \n"
    3: '³ He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious
      nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt
      against me to this very day. '
    4: '⁴ The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them,
      ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ '
    5: '⁵ And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they
      will know that a prophet has been among them. '
    6: '⁶ And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be
      afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions.
      Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a
      rebellious people. '
    7: '⁷ You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen,
      for they are rebellious. '
    8: "⁸ But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that\
      \ rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, '
    10: ¹⁰ which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of
      lament and mourning and woe.
  3:
    1: '¹ And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll;
      then go and speak to the people of Israel.” '
    2: "² So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. \n"
    3: "³ Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill\
      \ your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my\
      \ mouth. \n"
    4: '⁴ He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak
      my words to them. '
    5: '⁵ You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language,
      but to the people of Israel— '
    6: '⁶ not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words
      you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened
      to you. '
    7: '⁷ But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are
      not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. '
    8: '⁸ But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. '
    9: "⁹ I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do\
      \ not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all
      the words I speak to you. '
    11: "¹¹ Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is\
      \ what the Sovereign Lord says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound
      as the glory of the Lord rose from the place where it was standing. '
    13: '¹³ It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against
      each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. '
    14: '¹⁴ The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness
      and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the Lord on me. '
    15: "¹⁵ I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there,\
      \ where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me: '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear
      the word I speak and give them warning from me. '
    18: '¹⁸ When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn
      them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their
      life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable
      for their blood. '
    19: "¹⁹ But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness\
      \ or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved\
      \ yourself. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does
      evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did
      not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person
      did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. '
    21: "²¹ But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin,\
      \ they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² The hand of the Lord was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up and go
      out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.” '
    23: "²³ So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the Lord was standing\
      \ there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me
      and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. '
    25: '²⁵ And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that
      you cannot go out among the people. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will
      be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. '
    27: ²⁷ But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them,
      ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ Whoever will listen let them listen,
      and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.
  4:
    1: '¹ “Now, son of man, take a block of clay, put it in front of you and draw
      the city of Jerusalem on it. '
    2: '² Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it,
      set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. '
    3: "³ Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city\
      \ and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege\
      \ it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon
      yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side. '
    5: "⁵ I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So\
      \ for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel. \n"
    6: '⁶ “After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side,
      and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day
      for each year. '
    7: '⁷ Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy
      against her. '
    8: "⁸ I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the\
      \ other until you have finished the days of your siege. \n"
    9: '⁹ “Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in
      a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during
      the 390 days you lie on your side. '
    10: '¹⁰ Weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times. '
    11: '¹¹ Also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times. '
    12: '¹² Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight
      of the people, using human excrement for fuel.” '
    13: "¹³ The Lord said, “In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food\
      \ among the nations where I will drive them.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign Lord! I have never defiled myself. From\
      \ my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild\
      \ animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead\
      \ of human excrement.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ He then said to me: “Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply
      in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed
      water in despair, '
    17: ¹⁷ for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of
      each other and will waste away because of their sin.
  5:
    1: '¹ “Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor to shave
      your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair. '
    2: '² When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside
      the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And
      scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword. '
    3: '³ But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment. '
    4: "⁴ Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up.\
      \ A fire will spread from there to all Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set
      in the center of the nations, with countries all around her. '
    6: "⁶ Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more\
      \ than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has\
      \ not followed my decrees. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: You have been more unruly\
      \ than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws.\
      \ You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself am against you,
      Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations. '
    9: '⁹ Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never
      done before and will never do again. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children
      will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all
      your survivors to the winds. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because you
      have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices,
      I myself will shave you; I will not look on you with pity or spare you. '
    12: "¹² A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside\
      \ you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will\
      \ scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and\
      \ I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know\
      \ that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in
      the sight of all who pass by. '
    15: '¹⁵ You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror
      to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath
      and with stinging rebuke. I the Lord have spoken. '
    16: '¹⁶ When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I
      will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut
      off your supply of food. '
    17: ¹⁷ I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you
      childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring the
      sword against you. I the Lord have spoken.”
  6:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against
      them '
    3: '³ and say: ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord.
      This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines
      and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your
      high places. '
    4: '⁴ Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed;
      and I will slay your people in front of your idols. '
    5: '⁵ I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and
      I will scatter your bones around your altars. '
    6: '⁶ Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished,
      so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and
      ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out. '
    7: "⁷ Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you
      are scattered among the lands and nations. '
    9: '⁹ Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape
      will remember me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have
      turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols.
      They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable
      practices. '
    10: "¹⁰ And they will know that I am the Lord; I did not threaten in vain to bring\
      \ this calamity on them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Strike your hands together and
      stamp your feet and cry out “Alas!” because of all the wicked and detestable
      practices of the people of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine and
      plague. '
    12: '¹² One who is far away will die of the plague, and one who is near will fall
      by the sword, and anyone who survives and is spared will die of famine. So will
      I pour out my wrath on them. '
    13: '¹³ And they will know that I am the Lord, when their people lie slain among
      their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops,
      under every spreading tree and every leafy oak—places where they offered fragrant
      incense to all their idols. '
    14: ¹⁴ And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate
      waste from the desert to Diblah—wherever they live. Then they will know that
      I am the Lord.’”
  7:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: "² “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says to the land of Israel:\n\
      “‘The end! The end has come\n    upon the four corners of the land!\n"
    3: "³ The end is now upon you,\n    and I will unleash my anger against you.\n\
      I will judge you according to your conduct\n    and repay you for all your detestable\
      \ practices.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will not look on you with pity;\n    I will not spare you.\nI will surely\
      \ repay you for your conduct\n    and for the detestable practices among you.\n\
      “‘Then you will know that I am the Lord.’ \n"
    5: "⁵ “This is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n“‘Disaster! Unheard-of disaster!\n\

    6: "⁶ The end has come!\n    The end has come!\nIt has roused itself against you.\n\
      \    See, it comes!\n"
    7: "⁷ Doom has come upon you,\n    upon you who dwell in the land.\nThe time has\
      \ come! The day is near!\n    There is panic, not joy, on the mountains.\n"
    8: "⁸ I am about to pour out my wrath on you\n    and spend my anger against you.\n\
      I will judge you according to your conduct\n    and repay you for all your detestable\
      \ practices.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will not look on you with pity;\n    I will not spare you.\nI will repay\
      \ you for your conduct\n    and for the detestable practices among you.\n“‘Then\

    10: "¹⁰ “‘See, the day!\n    See, it comes!\nDoom has burst forth,\n    the rod\
      \ has budded,\n    arrogance has blossomed!\n"
    11: "¹¹ Violence has arisen,\n    a rod to punish the wicked.\nNone of the people\
      \ will be left,\n    none of that crowd—\nnone of their wealth,\n    nothing\
      \ of value.\n"
    12: "¹² The time has come!\n    The day has arrived!\nLet not the buyer rejoice\n\
      \    nor the seller grieve,\n    for my wrath is on the whole crowd.\n"
    13: "¹³ The seller will not recover\n    the property that was sold—\n    as long\
      \ as both buyer and seller live.\nFor the vision concerning the whole crowd\n\
      \    will not be reversed.\nBecause of their sins, not one of them\n    will\

    14: "¹⁴ “‘They have blown the trumpet,\n    they have made all things ready,\n\

    15: "¹⁵ Outside is the sword;\n    inside are plague and famine.\nThose in the\
      \ country\n    will die by the sword;\nthose in the city\n    will be devoured\
      \ by famine and plague.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The fugitives who escape\n    will flee to the mountains.\nLike doves\
      \ of the valleys,\n    they will all moan,\n    each for their own sins.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Every hand will go limp;\n    every leg will be wet with urine.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ They will put on sackcloth\n    and be clothed with terror.\nEvery face\
      \ will be covered with shame,\n    and every head will be shaved. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “‘They will throw their silver into the streets,\n    and their gold will\
      \ be treated as a thing unclean.\nTheir silver and gold\n    will not be able\
      \ to deliver them\n    in the day of the Lord’s wrath.\nIt will not satisfy\
      \ their hunger\n    or fill their stomachs,\n    for it has caused them to stumble\
      \ into sin.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They took pride in their beautiful jewelry\n    and used it to make their\
      \ detestable idols.\nThey made it into vile images;\n    therefore I will make\
      \ it a thing unclean for them.\n"
    21: "²¹ I will give their wealth as plunder to foreigners\n    and as loot to\
      \ the wicked of the earth,\n    who will defile it.\n"
    22: "²² I will turn my face away from the people,\n    and robbers will desecrate\

    25: "²⁵ When terror comes,\n    they will seek peace in vain.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Calamity upon calamity will come,\n    and rumor upon rumor.\nThey will\
      \ go searching for a vision from the prophet,\n    priestly instruction in the\

    27: "²⁷ The king will mourn,\n    the prince will be clothed with despair,\n \
      \   and the hands of the people of the land will tremble.\nI will deal with\

    1: '¹ In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting
      in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the
      Sovereign Lord came on me there. '
    2: '² I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be
      his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright
      as glowing metal. '
    3: '³ He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head.
      The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took
      me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where
      the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. '
    4: "⁴ And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision\
      \ I had seen in the plain. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and\
      \ in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly\
      \ detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me\
      \ far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole
      in the wall. '
    8: "⁸ He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall\
      \ and saw a doorway there. \n"
    9: '⁹ And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they
      are doing here.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds
      of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of\
      \ Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant\
      \ cloud of incense was rising. \n"
    12: '¹² He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are
      doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The Lord
      does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.’” '
    13: "¹³ Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the
      Lord, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz. '
    15: "¹⁵ He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that\
      \ are even more detestable than this.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and\
      \ there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were\
      \ about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the Lord and\
      \ their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter
      for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must
      they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look
      at them putting the branch to their nose! '
    18: ¹⁸ Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with
      pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them.”
  9:
    1: '¹ Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed
      to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.” '
    2: "² And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces\
      \ north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed\
      \ in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside\
      \ the bronze altar. \n"
    3: '³ Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where
      it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the Lord called
      to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side '
    4: "⁴ and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on\
      \ the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things\
      \ that are done in it.” \n"
    5: '⁵ As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill,
      without showing pity or compassion. '
    6: "⁶ Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children,\
      \ but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they\
      \ began with the old men who were in front of the temple. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain.
      Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city. '
    8: "⁸ While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out,\
      \ “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel\
      \ in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?” \n"
    9: '⁹ He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly
      great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They
      say, ‘The Lord has forsaken the land; the Lord does not see.’ '
    10: "¹⁰ So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down\
      \ on their own heads what they have done.” \n"
    11: ¹¹ Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word,
      saying, “I have done as you commanded.”
  10:
    1: '¹ I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault
      that was over the heads of the cherubim. '
    2: "² The Lord said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the wheels beneath\
      \ the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and\
      \ scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in. \n"
    3: '³ Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the
      man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. '
    4: '⁴ Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the
      threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full
      of the radiance of the glory of the Lord. '
    5: "⁵ The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the\
      \ outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. \n"
    6: '⁶ When the Lord commanded the man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels,
      from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel. '
    7: '⁷ Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among
      them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who
      took it and went out. '
    8: "⁸ (Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.)\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of
      the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz. '
    10: '¹⁰ As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like
      a wheel intersecting a wheel. '
    11: '¹¹ As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim
      faced; the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went. The cherubim went
      in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went. '
    12: '¹² Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings,
      were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels. '
    13: '¹³ I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.” '
    14: "¹⁴ Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the\
      \ second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth\
      \ the face of an eagle. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen
      by the Kebar River. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim
      spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side. '
    17: "¹⁷ When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim\
      \ rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was\
      \ in them. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple
      and stopped above the cherubim. '
    19: "¹⁹ While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground,\
      \ and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance\
      \ of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was\
      \ above them. \n"
    20: '²⁰ These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by
      the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim. '
    21: '²¹ Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked
      like human hands. '
    22: ²² Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River.
      Each one went straight ahead.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of
      the Lord that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five
      men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah,
      leaders of the people. '
    2: '² The Lord said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil
      and giving wicked advice in this city. '
    3: '³ They say, ‘Haven’t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot,
      and we are the meat in it.’ '
    4: "⁴ Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me, and he told me to say: “This is
      what the Lord says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but
      I know what is going through your mind. '
    6: "⁶ You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the\
      \ dead. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: The bodies you have thrown
      there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it. '
    8: '⁸ You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares
      the Sovereign Lord. '
    9: '⁹ I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners
      and inflict punishment on you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the
      borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I
      will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. '
    12: "¹² And you will know that I am the Lord, for you have not followed my decrees\
      \ or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around\
      \ you.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown\
      \ and cried out in a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Will you completely\
      \ destroy the remnant of Israel?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    15: "¹⁵ “Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and\
      \ all the other Israelites, ‘They are far away from the Lord; this land was\
      \ given to us as our possession.’ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Although I sent\
      \ them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet\
      \ for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where\
      \ they have gone.’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will gather you\
      \ from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been\
      \ scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.’ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable
      idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will
      remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. '
    20: '²⁰ Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They
      will be my people, and I will be their God. '
    21: "²¹ But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable\
      \ idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares\
      \ the Sovereign Lord.” \n"
    22: '²² Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and
      the glory of the God of Israel was above them. '
    23: '²³ The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the
      mountain east of it. '
    24: "²⁴ The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia in the\
      \ vision given by the Spirit of God.\nThen the vision I had seen went up from\
      \ me, "
    25: ²⁵ and I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me.
  12:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: "² “Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to\
      \ see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious\
      \ people. \n"
    3: '³ “Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime,
      as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they
      will understand, though they are a rebellious people. '
    4: '⁴ During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for
      exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go
      into exile. '
    5: '⁵ While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through
      it. '
    6: "⁶ Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk.\
      \ Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign\
      \ to the Israelites.” \n"
    7: "⁷ So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed\
      \ for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took\
      \ my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ In the morning the word of the Lord came to me: '
    9: "⁹ “Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, ‘What\
      \ are you doing?’ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This prophecy concerns
      the prince in Jerusalem and all the Israelites who are there.’ '
    11: "¹¹ Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’\n“As I have done, so it will be done\
      \ to them. They will go into exile as captives. \n"
    12: '¹² “The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and
      leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover
      his face so that he cannot see the land. '
    13: '¹³ I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will
      bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and
      there he will die. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his\
      \ troops—and I will pursue them with drawn sword. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “They will know that I am the Lord, when I disperse them among the nations
      and scatter them through the countries. '
    16: "¹⁶ But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that\
      \ in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices.\
      \ Then they will know that I am the Lord.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    18: '¹⁸ “Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you
      drink your water. '
    19: '¹⁹ Say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says about
      those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food
      in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped
      of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there. '
    20: "²⁰ The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate.\
      \ Then you will know that I am the Lord.’” \n"
    21: '²¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    22: '²² “Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: ‘The
      days go by and every vision comes to nothing’? '
    23: '²³ Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to put
      an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.’ Say to
      them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled. '
    24: '²⁴ For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among
      the people of Israel. '
    25: "²⁵ But I the Lord will speak what I will, and it shall be fulfilled without\
      \ delay. For in your days, you rebellious people, I will fulfill whatever I\
      \ say, declares the Sovereign Lord.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    27: "²⁷ “Son of man, the Israelites are saying, ‘The vision he sees is for many\
      \ years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: None of
      my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares
      the Sovereign Lord.’”'
  13:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying.
      Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: ‘Hear the word of the
      Lord! '
    3: '³ This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow
      their own spirit and have seen nothing! '
    4: '⁴ Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. '
    5: '⁵ You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall to repair it for the people
      of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. Even though the Lord
      has not sent them, they say, “The Lord declares,” and expect him to fulfill
      their words. '
    7: "⁷ Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say,\
      \ “The Lord declares,” though I have not spoken? \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because of your false
      words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    9: "⁹ My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying\
      \ divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed\
      \ in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you\
      \ will know that I am the Sovereign Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘Because they lead my people astray, saying, “Peace,” when there is no
      peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash, '
    11: '¹¹ therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall.
      Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent
      winds will burst forth. '
    12: "¹² When the wall collapses, will people not ask you, “Where is the whitewash\
      \ you covered it with?” \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: In my wrath I will unleash
      a violent wind, and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with
      destructive fury. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level
      it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you
      will be destroyed in it; and you will know that I am the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ So I will pour out my wrath against the wall and against those who covered
      it with whitewash. I will say to you, “The wall is gone and so are those who
      whitewashed it, '
    16: "¹⁶ those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of\
      \ peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Sovereign Lord.”’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who
      prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them '
    18: '¹⁸ and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to the women who sew
      magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their
      heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but
      preserve your own? '
    19: "¹⁹ You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and\
      \ scraps of bread. By lying to my people, who listen to lies, you have killed\
      \ those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against your magic
      charms with which you ensnare people like birds and I will tear them from your
      arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds. '
    21: '²¹ I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they
      will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the Lord. '
    22: '²² Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies, when I had brought
      them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their
      evil ways and so save their lives, '
    23: ²³ therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination.
      I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the
      Lord.’”
  14:
    1: '¹ Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me. '
    2: '² Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    3: '³ “Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked
      stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all? '
    4: '⁴ Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord
      says: When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked
      stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet, I the Lord will
      answer them myself in keeping with their great idolatry. '
    5: "⁵ I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have\
      \ all deserted me for their idols.’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord\

      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separate
      themselves from me and set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling
      block before their faces and then go to a prophet to inquire of me, I the Lord
      will answer them myself. '
    8: "⁸ I will set my face against them and make them an example and a byword. I\
      \ will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘And if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the Lord have enticed
      that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from
      among my people Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ They will bear their guilt—the prophet will be as guilty as the one who
      consults him. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the people of Israel will no longer stray from me, nor will they\
      \ defile themselves anymore with all their sins. They will be my people, and\

    12: '¹² The word of the Lord came to me: '
    13: '¹³ “Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch
      out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and
      kill its people and their animals, '
    14: "¹⁴ even if these three men—Noah, Daniel and Job—were in it, they could save\

  15:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from
      any of the trees in the forest? '
    3: '³ Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from
      it to hang things on? '
    4: '⁴ And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends
      and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? '
    5: "⁵ If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it\
      \ be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood
      of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat
      the people living in Jerusalem. '
    7: '⁷ I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire,
      the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will
      know that I am the Lord. '
    8: ⁸ I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares
      the Sovereign Lord.”
  16:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices '
    3: '³ and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry

      your mother a Hittite. '
    4: '⁴ On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with
      water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. '
    5: "⁵ No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these\

    6: '⁶ “‘Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay
      there in your blood I said to you, “Live!” '
    7: "⁷ I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered\

    8: "⁸ “‘Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old\

    9: '⁹ “‘I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments

    13: '¹³ So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen

    16: '¹⁶ You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried
      on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty. '
    17: '¹⁷ You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold

      with them. '
    18: '¹⁸ And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered
      my oil and incense before them. '
    19: "¹⁹ Also the food I provided for you—the flour, olive oil and honey I gave\
      \ you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened,\

    20: '²⁰ “‘And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed
      them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? '
    21: '²¹ You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. '
    22: "²² In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember\

    23: '²³ “‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign Lord. In addition to all your
      other wickedness, '
    24: '²⁴ you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public
      square. '
    25: '²⁵ At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your
      beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed
      by. '
    26: '²⁶ You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large
      genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity. '
    27: '²⁷ So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave
      you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who
      were shocked by your lewd conduct. '
    28: '²⁸ You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable;
      and even after that, you still were not satisfied. '
    29: "²⁹ Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants,\

    30: '³⁰ “‘I am filled with fury against you, declares the Sovereign Lord, when
      you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! '
    31: "³¹ When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty\
      \ shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you\
      \ scorned payment. \n"
    32: '³² “‘You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! '
    33: '³³ All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers,
      bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. '
    34: "³⁴ So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after\
      \ you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none\

    35: '³⁵ “‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the Lord! '
    36: '³⁶ This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you poured out your lust
      and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because
      of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood, '
    37: '³⁷ therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure,
      those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from
      all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see you stark
      naked. '
    38: '³⁸ I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and
      who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous

    39: '³⁹ Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear
      down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your

    40: '⁴⁰ They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to
      pieces with their swords. '
    41: '⁴¹ They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight
      of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer

    42: "⁴² Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn\

    44: '⁴⁴ “‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like

    46: '⁴⁶ Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her
      daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters,

    47: '⁴⁷ You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices,

    49: '⁴⁹ “‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were

    50: '⁵⁰ They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did
      away with them as you have seen. '
    51: '⁵¹ Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable
      things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things

    52: "⁵² Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your\

    55: '⁵⁵ And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters,

      to what you were before. '
    56: '⁵⁶ You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, '
    57: '⁵⁷ before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by
      the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all

    58: "⁵⁸ You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices,\

    60: '⁶⁰ Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth,

    61: '⁶¹ Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your
      sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will

    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as a parable. '
    3: '³ Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: A great eagle with powerful
      wings, long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking
      hold of the top of a cedar, '
    4: "⁴ he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants,\
      \ where he planted it in a city of traders. \n"
    5: '⁵ “‘He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil. He
      planted it like a willow by abundant water, '
    6: "⁶ and it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned toward\
      \ him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches\
      \ and put out leafy boughs. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage.
      The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted
      and stretched out its branches to him for water. '
    8: "⁸ It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce\
      \ branches, bear fruit and become a splendid vine.’ \n"
    9: '⁹ “Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Will it thrive? Will
      it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new

      up by the roots. '
    10: "¹⁰ It has been planted, but will it thrive? Will it not wither completely\
      \ when the east wind strikes it—wither away in the plot where it grew?’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    12: '¹² “Say to this rebellious people, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’

      and her nobles, bringing them back with him to Babylon. '
    13: '¹³ Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him,
      putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land, '
    14: '¹⁴ so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving
      only by keeping his treaty. '
    15: "¹⁵ But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get\

    23: '²³ On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it; it will produce branches
      and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in
      it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches. '
    24: "²⁴ All the trees of the forest will know that I the Lord bring down the tall\

      \ of Babylon.\nThey put him in prison,\n    so his roar was heard no longer\n\
      \    on the mountains of Israel. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard\n    planted by the water;\n\
      it was fruitful and full of branches\n    because of abundant water.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Its branches were strong,\n    fit for a ruler’s scepter.\nIt towered\
      \ high\n    above the thick foliage,\nconspicuous for its height\n    and for\

    12: "¹² But it was uprooted in fury\n    and thrown to the ground.\nThe east wind\
      \ made it shrivel,\n    it was stripped of its fruit;\nits strong branches withered\n\

    13: "¹³ Now it is planted in the desert,\n    in a dry and thirsty land.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Fire spread from one of its main branches\n    and consumed its fruit.\n\
      No strong branch is left on it\n    fit for a ruler’s scepter.’\n“This is a\

  20:
    1: "¹ In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders\
      \ of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and they sat down in front of me. \n"
    2: '² Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    3: "³ “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what\
      \ the Sovereign Lord says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live,\
      \ I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign Lord.’ \n"
    4: '⁴ “Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them
      with the detestable practices of their ancestors '
    5: '⁵ and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day I chose
      Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed
      myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, “I am the Lord your
      God.” '
    6: '⁶ On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a
      land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most
      beautiful of all lands. '
    7: "⁷ And I said to them, “Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set\
      \ your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the\
      \ Lord your God.” \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not
      get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake
      the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my
      anger against them in Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep
      my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived
      and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites. '
    10: '¹⁰ Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. '
    11: '¹¹ I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, by which the person
      who obeys them will live. '
    12: "¹² Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know\
      \ that I the Lord made them holy. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They
      did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws—by which the person who obeys
      them will live—and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour
      out my wrath on them and destroy them in the wilderness. '
    14: '¹⁴ But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned
      in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. '
    15: '¹⁵ Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would
      not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey,
      the most beautiful of all lands— '
    16: '¹⁶ because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated
      my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols. '
    17: '¹⁷ Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end
      to them in the wilderness. '
    18: '¹⁸ I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the statutes
      of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I am the Lord your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. '
    20: "²⁰ Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will\
      \ know that I am the Lord your God.” \n"
    21: '²¹ “‘But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees,
      they were not careful to keep my laws, of which I said, “The person who obeys
      them will live by them,” and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would
      pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. '
    22: '²² But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep
      it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought
      them out. '
    23: '²³ Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would
      disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries, '
    24: '²⁴ because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated
      my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents’ idols. '
    25: '²⁵ So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which
      they could not live; '
    26: "²⁶ I defiled them through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that\
      \ I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the Lord.’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them,
      ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed
      me by being unfaithful to me: '
    28: '²⁸ When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw
      any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, made offerings
      that aroused my anger, presented their fragrant incense and poured out their
      drink offerings. '
    29: "²⁹ Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?’” (It is called\
      \ Bamah to this day.) \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Therefore say to the Israelites: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
      Will you defile yourselves the way your ancestors did and lust after their vile
      images? '
    31: "³¹ When you offer your gifts—the sacrifice of your children in the fire—you\

    32: '³² “‘You say, “We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world,
      who serve wood and stone.” But what you have in mind will never happen. '
    33: '³³ As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will reign over you
      with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath. '
    34: '³⁴ I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where
      you have been scattered—with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with
      outpoured wrath. '
    35: '³⁵ I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and there, face to
      face, I will execute judgment upon you. '
    36: '³⁶ As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so
      I will judge you, declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    37: '³⁷ I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you
      into the bond of the covenant. '
    38: "³⁸ I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me. Although I\
      \ will bring them out of the land where they are living, yet they will not enter\
      \ the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    39: '³⁹ “‘As for you, people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:
      Go and serve your idols, every one of you! But afterward you will surely listen
      to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols. '
    40: '⁴⁰ For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign
      Lord, there in the land all the people of Israel will serve me, and there I
      will accept them. There I will require your offerings and your choice gifts,
      along with all your holy sacrifices. '
    41: '⁴¹ I will accept you as fragrant incense when I bring you out from the nations
      and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will
      be proved holy through you in the sight of the nations. '
    42: '⁴² Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land
      of Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your ancestors. '
    43: '⁴³ There you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you

    45: '⁴⁵ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    46: '⁴⁶ “Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south
      and prophesy against the forest of the southland. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Say to the southern forest: ‘Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the

    48: "⁴⁸ Everyone will see that I the Lord have kindled it; it will not be quenched.’”\
      \ \n"
    49: ⁴⁹ Then I said, “Sovereign Lord, they are saying of me, ‘Isn’t he just telling

      my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked. '
    4: '⁴ Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked, my sword will

    6: '⁶ “Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before them with broken heart and bitter

    7: "⁷ And when they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you shall say, ‘Because of\

      \ It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign Lord.” \n"
    8: '⁸ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    9: "⁹ “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord says:\n“‘A sword,\

    22: '²² Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set

    27: '²⁷ Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed

    5: '⁵ “Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted
      after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors '
    6: '⁶ clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men,
      and mounted horsemen. '
    7: '⁷ She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled
      herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. '
    8: "⁸ She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her\
      \ youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust\

    9: '⁹ “Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians,

    10: "¹⁰ They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her\

    11: '¹¹ “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was
      more depraved than her sister. '
    12: '¹² She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors

    13: "¹³ I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed
      on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red, '

      of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. '
    16: '¹⁶ As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to
      them in Chaldea. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust
      they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them

    18: '¹⁸ When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body,
      I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. '
    19: '¹⁹ Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her
      youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys
      and whose emission was like that of horses. '
    21: "²¹ So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom\
      \ was caressed and your young breasts fondled. \n"
    22: '²² “Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will stir

    14: '¹⁴ And if I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but they then
      turn away from their sin and do what is just and right— '
    15: '¹⁵ if they give back what they took in pledge for a loan, return what they
      have stolen, follow the decrees that give life, and do no evil—that person will
      surely live; they will not die. '
    16: "¹⁶ None of the sins that person has committed will be remembered against\
      \ them. They have done what is just and right; they will surely live. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But it is their
      way that is not just. '
    18: '¹⁸ If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, they
      will die for it. '
    19: '¹⁹ And if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what
      is just and right, they will live by doing so. '
    20: "²⁰ Yet you Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But I will\
      \ judge each of you according to your own ways.” \n"
    21: '²¹ In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day,
      a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has fallen!” '
    22: "²² Now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the Lord was on me,\
      \ and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth\
      \ was opened and I was no longer silent. \n"
    23: '²³ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    24: '²⁴ “Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are
      saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many;
      surely the land has been given to us as our possession.’ '
    25: '²⁵ Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Since you
      eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should
      you then possess the land? '
    26: "²⁶ You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles\
      \ his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Say this to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: As surely as
      I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in
      the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds
      and caves will die of a plague. '
    28: '²⁸ I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come
      to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will
      cross them. '
    29: "²⁹ Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desolate\
      \ waste because of all the detestable things they have done.’ \n"
    30: '³⁰ “As for you, son of man, your people are talking together about you by
      the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, ‘Come and hear
      the message that has come from the Lord.’ '
    31: '³¹ My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear
      your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love,
      but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain. '
    32: "³² Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with\
      \ a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but\
      \ do not put them into practice. \n"
    33: ³³ “When all this comes true—and it surely will—then they will know that a
      prophet has been among them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say
      to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel
      who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? '
    3: '³ You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice
      animals, but you do not take care of the flock. '
    4: '⁴ You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.
      You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled
      them harshly and brutally. '
    5: '⁵ So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were
      scattered they became food for all the wild animals. '
    6: "⁶ My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were\
      \ scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    8: '⁸ As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because my flock lacks
      a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals,
      and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves
      rather than for my flock, '
    9: '⁹ therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: '
    10: "¹⁰ This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against the shepherds and will\
      \ hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock\
      \ so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock\
      \ from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “‘For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my
      sheep and look after them. '
    12: '¹² As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so
      will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they
      were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries,
      and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains
      of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel
      will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and
      there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. '
    15: '¹⁵ I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign
      Lord. '
    16: "¹⁶ I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the\
      \ injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy.\
      \ I will shepherd the flock with justice. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “‘As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will judge
      between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats. '
    18: '¹⁸ Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample
      the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear
      water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? '
    19: "¹⁹ Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied\
      \ with your feet? \n"
    20: '²⁰ “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says to them: See, I myself
      will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. '
    21: '²¹ Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep
      with your horns until you have driven them away, '
    22: '²² I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge
      between one sheep and another. '
    23: '²³ I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend
      them; he will tend them and be their shepherd. '
    24: "²⁴ I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among\
      \ them. I the Lord have spoken. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “‘I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of savage
      beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. I will
      send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing. '
    27: '²⁷ The trees will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops;
      the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the Lord,
      when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those
      who enslaved them. '
    28: '²⁸ They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals
      devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid. '
    29: '²⁹ I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no
      longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations. '
    30: '³⁰ Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them and that
      they, the Israelites, are my people, declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    31: ³¹ You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares
      the Sovereign Lord.’”
  35:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it '
    3: '³ and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Mount
      Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste. '
    4: "⁴ I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will\
      \ know that I am the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ “‘Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites
      over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached
      its climax, '
    6: '⁶ therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will give
      you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed,
      bloodshed will pursue you. '
    7: '⁷ I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come
      and go. '
    8: '⁸ I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will
      fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. '
    9: "⁹ I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then\
      \ you will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “‘Because you have said, “These two nations and countries will be ours
      and we will take possession of them,” even though I the Lord was there, '
    11: '¹¹ therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will treat
      you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them
      and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. '
    12: '¹² Then you will know that I the Lord have heard all the contemptible things
      you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, “They have been laid
      waste and have been given over to us to devour.” '
    13: '¹³ You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard
      it. '
    14: '¹⁴ This is what the Sovereign Lord says: While the whole earth rejoices,
      I will make you desolate. '
    15: ¹⁵ Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that
      is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom.
      Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”
  36:
    1: '¹ “Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of
      Israel, hear the word of the Lord. '
    2: '² This is what the Sovereign Lord says: The enemy said of you, “Aha! The ancient
      heights have become our possession.”’ '
    3: '³ Therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because
      they ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession
      of the rest of the nations and the object of people’s malicious talk and slander, '
    4: '⁴ therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord: This
      is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and
      valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered
      and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you— '
    5: '⁵ this is what the Sovereign Lord says: In my burning zeal I have spoken against
      the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, for with glee and with malice
      in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder
      its pastureland.’ '
    6: '⁶ Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains
      and hills, to the ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
      I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations. '
    7: "⁷ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I swear with uplifted hand\
      \ that the nations around you will also suffer scorn. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people
      Israel, for they will soon come home. '
    9: '⁹ I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed
      and sown, '
    10: '¹⁰ and I will cause many people to live on you—yes, all of Israel. The towns
      will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. '
    11: '¹¹ I will increase the number of people and animals living on you, and they
      will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the
      past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am
      the Lord. '
    12: "¹² I will cause people, my people Israel, to live on you. They will possess\
      \ you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them\
      \ of their children. \n"
    13: '¹³ “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because some say to you, “You
      devour people and deprive your nation of its children,” '
    14: '¹⁴ therefore you will no longer devour people or make your nation childless,
      declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    15: "¹⁵ No longer will I make you hear the taunts of the nations, and no longer\
      \ will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall, declares\
      \ the Sovereign Lord.’” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Again the word of the Lord came to me: '
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land,
      they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a
      woman’s monthly uncleanness in my sight. '
    18: '¹⁸ So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land
      and because they had defiled it with their idols. '
    19: '¹⁹ I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the
      countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions. '
    20: '²⁰ And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for
      it was said of them, ‘These are the Lord’s people, and yet they had to leave
      his land.’ '
    21: "²¹ I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among\
      \ the nations where they had gone. \n"
    22: '²² “Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
      It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to do these things,
      but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations
      where you have gone. '
    23: "²³ I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among\
      \ the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will\
      \ know that I am the Lord, declares the Sovereign Lord, when I am proved holy\
      \ through you before their eyes. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “‘For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the
      countries and bring you back into your own land. '
    25: '²⁵ I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse
      you from all your impurities and from all your idols. '
    26: '²⁶ I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove
      from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. '
    27: '²⁷ And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and
      be careful to keep my laws. '
    28: '²⁸ Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people,
      and I will be your God. '
    29: '²⁹ I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and
      make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you. '
    30: '³⁰ I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so
      that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine. '
    31: '³¹ Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe
      yourselves for your sins and detestable practices. '
    32: "³² I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the\
      \ Sovereign Lord. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel!\
      \ \n"
    33: '³³ “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day I cleanse you from
      all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt. '
    34: '³⁴ The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the
      sight of all who pass through it. '
    35: '³⁵ They will say, “This land that was laid waste has become like the garden
      of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now
      fortified and inhabited.” '
    36: "³⁶ Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the Lord have\
      \ rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the Lord\
      \ have spoken, and I will do it.’ \n"
    37: '³⁷ “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Once again I will yield to Israel’s
      plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep, '
    38: ³⁸ as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed
      festivals. So will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they
      will know that I am the Lord.”
  37:
    1: '¹ The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the
      Lord and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. '
    2: '² He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the
      floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. '
    3: "³ He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”\nI said, “Sovereign Lord,\
      \ you alone know.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones,
      hear the word of the Lord! '
    5: '⁵ This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath
      enter you, and you will come to life. '
    6: "⁶ I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you\
      \ with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will\
      \ know that I am the Lord.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was
      a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. '
    8: "⁸ I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them,\
      \ but there was no breath in them. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say
      to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, breath, from the four winds
      and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’” '
    10: "¹⁰ So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came\
      \ to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel.
      They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’ '
    12: '¹² Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
      My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will
      bring you back to the land of Israel. '
    13: '¹³ Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves
      and bring you up from them. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in\
      \ your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have\
      \ done it, declares the Lord.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    16: '¹⁶ “Son of man, take a stick of wood and write on it, ‘Belonging to Judah
      and the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick of wood, and
      write on it, ‘Belonging to Joseph (that is, to Ephraim) and all the Israelites
      associated with him.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your\
      \ hand. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’ '
    19: '¹⁹ say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to take
      the stick of Joseph—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and of the Israelite tribes associated
      with him, and join it to Judah’s stick. I will make them into a single stick
      of wood, and they will become one in my hand.’ '
    20: '²⁰ Hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on '
    21: '²¹ and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will take the
      Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from
      all around and bring them back into their own land. '
    22: '²² I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. There
      will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or
      be divided into two kingdoms. '
    23: "²³ They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile images\
      \ or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all their sinful\

    24: '²⁴ “‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one
      shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees. '
    25: '²⁵ They will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where
      your ancestors lived. They and their children and their children’s children
      will live there forever, and David my servant will be their prince forever. '
    26: '²⁶ I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant.
      I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary
      among them forever. '
    27: '²⁷ My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will
      be my people. '
    28: ²⁸ Then the nations will know that I the Lord make Israel holy, when my sanctuary
      is among them forever.’”
  38:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief
      prince of Meshek and Tubal; prophesy against him '
    3: '³ and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Gog, chief
      prince of Meshek and Tubal. '
    4: '⁴ I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your
      whole army—your horses, your horsemen fully armed, and a great horde with large
      and small shields, all of them brandishing their swords. '
    5: '⁵ Persia, Cush and Put will be with them, all with shields and helmets, '
    6: "⁶ also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth Togarmah from the far north with\

    7: '⁷ “‘Get ready; be prepared, you and all the hordes gathered about you, and

      out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety. '
    9: "⁹ You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing\

    10: '¹⁰ “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On that day thoughts will come

      \ much plunder?”’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: ‘This is what the Sovereign
      Lord says: In that day, when my people Israel are living in safety, will you
      not take notice of it? '
    15: '¹⁵ You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with
      you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army. '
    16: "¹⁶ You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the\
      \ land. In days to come, Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the\
      \ nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You are the one I spoke of in
      former days by my servants the prophets of Israel. At that time they prophesied
      for years that I would bring you against them. '
    18: '¹⁸ This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel,
      my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    19: '¹⁹ In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be
      a great earthquake in the land of Israel. '
    20: '²⁰ The fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, every
      creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the
      earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs
      will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground. '
    21: '²¹ I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign
      Lord. Every man’s sword will be against his brother. '
    22: '²² I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour
      down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops
      and on the many nations with him. '
    23: ²³ And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself
      known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’
  39:
    1: '¹ “Son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord
      says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal. '
    2: '² I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far
      north and send you against the mountains of Israel. '
    3: '³ Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop
      from your right hand. '
    4: '⁴ On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the
      nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and
      to the wild animals. '
    5: '⁵ You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign
      Lord. '
    6: "⁶ I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands,\
      \ and they will know that I am the Lord. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer
      let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I the Lord am the
      Holy One in Israel. '
    8: "⁸ It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign Lord. This\
      \ is the day I have spoken of. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons
      for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows,
      the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel. '
    10: "¹⁰ They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests,\
      \ because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who\
      \ plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign Lord.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ “‘On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley\
      \ of those who travel east of the Sea. It will block the way of travelers, because\
      \ Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley\
      \ of Hamon Gog. \n"
    12: '¹² “‘For seven months the Israelites will be burying them in order to cleanse
      the land. '
    13: '¹³ All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory
      will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    14: "¹⁴ People will be continually employed in cleansing the land. They will spread\
      \ out across the land and, along with others, they will bury any bodies that\
      \ are lying on the ground.\n“‘After the seven months they will carry out a more\
      \ detailed search. "
    15: '¹⁵ As they go through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will leave a
      marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog, '
    16: "¹⁶ near a town called Hamonah. And so they will cleanse the land.’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Call out to every kind
      of bird and all the wild animals: ‘Assemble and come together from all around
      to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains
      of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood. '
    18: '¹⁸ You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes
      of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and bulls—all of them fattened
      animals from Bashan. '
    19: '¹⁹ At the sacrifice I am preparing for you, you will eat fat till you are
      glutted and drink blood till you are drunk. '
    20: "²⁰ At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, mighty men and\
      \ soldiers of every kind,’ declares the Sovereign Lord. \n"
    21: '²¹ “I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see
      the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay on them. '
    22: '²² From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord
      their God. '
    23: '²³ And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for
      their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and
      handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. '
    24: "²⁴ I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and\
      \ I hid my face from them. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will now restore the
      fortunes of Jacob and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, and
      I will be zealous for my holy name. '
    26: '²⁶ They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward
      me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid. '
    27: '²⁷ When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them
      from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the
      sight of many nations. '
    28: '²⁸ Then they will know that I am the Lord their God, for though I sent them
      into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving
      any behind. '
    29: ²⁹ I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit
      on the people of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
  40:
    1: '¹ In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on
      the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city—on
      that very day the hand of the Lord was on me and he took me there. '
    2: '² In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very
      high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. '
    3: '³ He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was
      standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. '
    4: "⁴ The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay\
      \ attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been\
      \ brought here. Tell the people of Israel everything you see.” \n"
    5: "⁵ I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring\
      \ rod in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each of which was a cubit and a\
      \ handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one\
      \ rod high. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he went to the east gate. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold
      of the gate; it was one rod deep. '
    7: "⁷ The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting\
      \ walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the\
      \ gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then he measured the portico of the gateway; '
    9: "⁹ it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico\
      \ of the gateway faced the temple. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the
      same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the
      same measurements. '
    11: '¹¹ Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gateway; it was ten
      cubits and its length was thirteen cubits. '
    12: '¹² In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were
      six cubits square. '
    13: '¹³ Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove
      to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one
      parapet opening to the opposite one. '
    14: '¹⁴ He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside
      of the gateway—sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the
      courtyard. '
    15: '¹⁵ The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico
      was fifty cubits. '
    16: "¹⁶ The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted\
      \ by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all\
      \ around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with\
      \ palm trees. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a
      pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms
      along the pavement. '
    18: '¹⁸ It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long;
      this was the lower pavement. '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to\
      \ the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as\
      \ well as on the north. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then he measured the length and width of the north gate, leading into
      the outer court. '
    21: '²¹ Its alcoves—three on each side—its projecting walls and its portico had
      the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long
      and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    22: '²² Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements
      as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico
      opposite them. '
    23: "²³ There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there\
      \ was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred\
      \ cubits. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then he led me to the south side and I saw the south gate. He measured
      its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. '
    25: '²⁵ The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings
      of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    26: '²⁶ Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm
      tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side. '
    27: "²⁷ The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this\
      \ gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he
      measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. '
    29: '²⁹ Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements
      as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty
      cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    30: '³⁰ (The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five
      cubits wide and five cubits deep.) '
    31: "³¹ Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and\
      \ eight steps led up to it. \n"
    32: '³² Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured
      the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. '
    33: '³³ Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements
      as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty
      cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    34: "³⁴ Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either\
      \ side, and eight steps led up to it. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same
      measurements as the others, '
    36: '³⁶ as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings
      all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. '
    37: "³⁷ Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either\
      \ side, and eight steps led up to it. \n"
    38: '³⁸ A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways,
      where the burnt offerings were washed. '
    39: '³⁹ In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the
      burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered. '
    40: '⁴⁰ By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the
      entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the
      steps were two tables. '
    41: '⁴¹ So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight
      tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. '
    42: '⁴² There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings,
      each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. On them
      were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other
      sacrifices. '
    43: "⁴³ And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the\
      \ wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one at
      the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the
      south gate and facing north. '
    45: '⁴⁵ He said to me, “The room facing south is for the priests who guard the
      temple, '
    46: "⁴⁶ and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These\
      \ are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the Lord\
      \ to minister before him.” \n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Then he measured the court: It was square—a hundred cubits long and a\
      \ hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple. \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the
      portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance
      was fourteen cubits and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either
      side. '
    49: ⁴⁹ The portico was twenty cubits wide, and twelve cubits from front to back.
      It was reached by a flight of stairs, and there were pillars on each side of
      the jambs.
  41:
    1: '¹ Then the man brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; the width
      of the jambs was six cubits on each side. '
    2: "² The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side\
      \ of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the main hall; it was forty\
      \ cubits long and twenty cubits wide. \n"
    3: '³ Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance;
      each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting
      walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide. '
    4: "⁴ And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits,\
      \ and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to\
      \ me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each
      side room around the temple was four cubits wide. '
    6: '⁶ The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level.
      There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for
      the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the
      temple. '
    7: "⁷ The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level.\
      \ The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that\
      \ the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor\
      \ to the top floor through the middle floor. \n"
    8: '⁸ I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation
      of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. '
    9: '⁹ The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between
      the side rooms of the temple '
    10: '¹⁰ and the priests’ rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. '
    11: "¹¹ There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the\
      \ north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five\
      \ cubits wide all around. \n"
    12: "¹² The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy\
      \ cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and\
      \ its length was ninety cubits. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits long, and the temple
      courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long. '
    14: "¹⁴ The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of\
      \ the temple, was a hundred cubits. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the\
      \ rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred\
      \ cubits.\nThe main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, "
    16: '¹⁶ as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around
      the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered
      with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. '
    17: '¹⁷ In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary
      and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary '
    18: '¹⁸ were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim.
      Each cherub had two faces: '
    19: '¹⁹ the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face
      of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the
      whole temple. '
    20: "²⁰ From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees\
      \ were carved on the wall of the main hall. \n"
    21: '²¹ The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of
      the Most Holy Place was similar. '
    22: '²² There was a wooden altar three cubits high and two cubits square; its
      corners, its base and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, “This is the
      table that is before the Lord.” '
    23: '²³ Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors. '
    24: '²⁴ Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door. '
    25: '²⁵ And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees
      like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front
      of the portico. '
    26: ²⁶ On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved
      on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the
      rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north
      side. '
    2: '² The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty
      cubits wide. '
    3: '³ Both in the section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section
      opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three
      levels. '
    4: '⁴ In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred
      cubits long. Their doors were on the north. '
    5: '⁵ Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from
      them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building. '
    6: '⁶ The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were
      smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors. '
    7: '⁷ There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended
      in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. '
    8: '⁸ While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits
      long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. '
    9: "⁹ The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from\
      \ the outer court. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining
      the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms '
    11: '¹¹ with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north;
      they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar
      to the doorways on the north '
    12: "¹² were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the\
      \ beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending\
      \ eastward, by which one enters the rooms. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard
      are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the
      most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings,
      the sin offerings and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy. '
    14: "¹⁴ Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the\
      \ outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for\
      \ these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places\
      \ that are for the people.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led
      me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: '
    16: '¹⁶ He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred
      cubits. '
    17: '¹⁷ He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring
      rod. '
    18: '¹⁸ He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring
      rod. '
    19: '¹⁹ Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits
      by the measuring rod. '
    20: ²⁰ So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five
      hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from
      the common.
  43:
    1: '¹ Then the man brought me to the gate facing east, '
    2: '² and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice
      was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory. '
    3: '³ The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came to destroy
      the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. '
    4: '⁴ The glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east. '
    5: "⁵ Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the\
      \ glory of the Lord filled the temple. \n"
    6: '⁶ While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from
      inside the temple. '
    7: '⁷ He said: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the
      soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The
      people of Israel will never again defile my holy name—neither they nor their
      kings—by their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings at their
      death. '
    8: '⁸ When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts
      beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy
      name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger. '
    9: "⁹ Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the funeral offerings\
      \ for their kings, and I will live among them forever. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may
      be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection, '
    11: "¹¹ and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the\
      \ design of the temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design\
      \ and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so that they\
      \ may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations. \n"
    12: "¹² “This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the\
      \ mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple. \n"
    13: '¹³ “These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, that cubit being
      a cubit and a handbreadth: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with
      a rim of one span around the edge. And this is the height of the altar: '
    14: '¹⁴ From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge that goes around the
      altar it is two cubits high, and the ledge is a cubit wide. From this lower
      ledge to the upper ledge that goes around the altar it is four cubits high,
      and that ledge is also a cubit wide. '
    15: '¹⁵ Above that, the altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project
      upward from the hearth. '
    16: '¹⁶ The altar hearth is square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide. '
    17: "¹⁷ The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits\
      \ wide. All around the altar is a gutter of one cubit with a rim of half a cubit.\
      \ The steps of the altar face east.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:
      These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and splashing
      blood against the altar when it is built: '
    19: '¹⁹ You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the Levitical priests
      of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign
      Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the
      altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and
      so purify the altar and make atonement for it. '
    21: "²¹ You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated\
      \ part of the temple area outside the sanctuary. \n"
    22: '²² “On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin
      offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull. '
    23: '²³ When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and
      a ram from the flock, both without defect. '
    24: "²⁴ You are to offer them before the Lord, and the priests are to sprinkle\
      \ salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the Lord. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering;
      you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without
      defect. '
    26: '²⁶ For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it;
      thus they will dedicate it. '
    27: ²⁷ At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present
      your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept
      you, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
  44:
    1: '¹ Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one
      facing east, and it was shut. '
    2: '² The Lord said to me, “This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened;
      no one may enter through it. It is to remain shut because the Lord, the God
      of Israel, has entered through it. '
    3: "³ The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat\
      \ in the presence of the Lord. He is to enter by way of the portico of the gateway\
      \ and go out the same way.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple.\
      \ I looked and saw the glory of the Lord filling the temple of the Lord, and\
      \ I fell facedown. \n"
    5: '⁵ The Lord said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give
      attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations and instructions
      regarding the temple of the Lord. Give attention to the entrance to the temple
      and all the exits of the sanctuary. '
    6: '⁶ Say to rebellious Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Enough
      of your detestable practices, people of Israel! '
    7: '⁷ In addition to all your other detestable practices, you brought foreigners
      uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while
      you offered me food, fat and blood, and you broke my covenant. '
    8: '⁸ Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things, you put others
      in charge of my sanctuary. '
    9: "⁹ This is what the Sovereign Lord says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart\

    10: '¹⁰ “‘The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered
      from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin. '
    11: '¹¹ They may serve in my sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple
      and serving in it; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for
      the people and stand before the people and serve them. '
    12: '¹² But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the
      people of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that
      they must bear the consequences of their sin, declares the Sovereign Lord. '
    13: '¹³ They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my
      holy things or my most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable
      practices. '
    14: "¹⁴ And I will appoint them to guard the temple for all the work that is to\

    15: '¹⁵ “‘But the Levitical priests, who are descendants of Zadok and who guarded
      my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, are to come near to minister

    17: '¹⁷ “‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen
      clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while ministering at the gates
      of the inner court or inside the temple. '
    18: '¹⁸ They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments
      around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire. '
    19: "¹⁹ When they go out into the outer court where the people are, they are to\
      \ take off the clothes they have been ministering in and are to leave them in\
      \ the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that the people are not consecrated\

    20: '²⁰ “‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they
      are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed. '

    22: '²² They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may marry only virgins
      of Israelite descent or widows of priests. '
    23: "²³ They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common\

    25: '²⁵ “‘A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however,
      if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried
      sister, then he may defile himself. '
    26: '²⁶ After he is cleansed, he must wait seven days. '
    27: "²⁷ On the day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister in\
      \ the sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering for himself, declares the Sovereign\
      \ Lord. \n"
    28: '²⁸ “‘I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them
      no possession in Israel; I will be their possession. '
    29: '²⁹ They will eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings;
      and everything in Israel devoted to the Lord will belong to them. '
    30: '³⁰ The best of all the firstfruits and of all your special gifts will belong
      to the priests. You are to give them the first portion of your ground meal so
      that a blessing may rest on your household. '

    2: '² Of this, a section 500 cubits square is to be for the sanctuary, with 50

    3: '³ On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the

    13: '¹³ “‘Every day you are to provide a year-old lamb without defect for a burnt

    21: '²¹ He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners,

  47:
    1: '¹ The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming
      out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced
      east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south
      of the altar. '
    2: "² He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside\

    3: '³ As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured
      off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankle-deep. '
    4: '⁴ He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was
      knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was
      up to the waist. '
    5: '⁵ He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not
      cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that
      no one could cross. '
    6: "⁶ He asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?”\nThen he led me back to the\
      \ bank of the river. "
    7: '⁷ When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the
      river. '
    8: '⁸ He said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down
      into the Arabah, where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea,
      the salty water there becomes fresh. '
    9: '⁹ Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will
      be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt
      water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live. '
    10: '¹⁰ Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there
      will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish
      of the Mediterranean Sea. '
    11: '¹¹ But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for
      salt. '
    12: "¹² Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves\
      \ will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit,\
