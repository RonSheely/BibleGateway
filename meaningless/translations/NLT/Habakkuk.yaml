Habakkuk:
  1:
    1: "¹ This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision. \n"
    2: "² How long, O Lord, must I call for help?\n    But you do not listen!\n“Violence\
      \ is everywhere!” I cry,\n    but you do not come to save.\n"
    3: "³ Must I forever see these evil deeds?\n    Why must I watch all this misery?\n\
      Wherever I look,\n    I see destruction and violence.\nI am surrounded by people\n\
      \    who love to argue and fight.\n"
    4: "⁴ The law has become paralyzed,\n    and there is no justice in the courts.\n\
      The wicked far outnumber the righteous,\n    so that justice has become perverted.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord replied, \n“Look around at the nations;\n    look and be amazed!\n\
      For I am doing something in your own day,\n    something you wouldn’t believe\n\
      \    even if someone told you about it.\n"
    6: "⁶ I am raising up the Babylonians,\n    a cruel and violent people.\nThey\
      \ will march across the world\n    and conquer other lands.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are notorious for their cruelty\n    and do whatever they like.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their horses are swifter than cheetahs\n    and fiercer than wolves at dusk.\n\
      Their charioteers charge from far away.\n    Like eagles, they swoop down to\
      \ devour their prey. \n"
    9: "⁹ “On they come, all bent on violence.\n    Their hordes advance like a desert\
      \ wind,\n    sweeping captives ahead of them like sand.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They scoff at kings and princes\n    and scorn all their fortresses.\n\
      They simply pile ramps of earth\n    against their walls and capture them!\n"
    11: "¹¹ They sweep past like the wind\n    and are gone.\nBut they are deeply\
      \ guilty,\n    for their own strength is their god.” \n"
    12: "¹² O Lord my God, my Holy One, you who are eternal—\n    surely you do not\
      \ plan to wipe us out?\nO Lord, our Rock, you have sent these Babylonians to\
      \ correct us,\n    to punish us for our many sins.\n"
    13: "¹³ But you are pure and cannot stand the sight of evil.\n    Will you wink\
      \ at their treachery?\nShould you be silent while the wicked\n    swallow up\
      \ people more righteous than they? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Are we only fish to be caught and killed?\n    Are we only sea creatures\
      \ that have no leader?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Must we be strung up on their hooks\n    and caught in their nets while\
      \ they rejoice and celebrate?\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then they will worship their nets\n    and burn incense in front of them.\n\
      “These nets are the gods who have made us rich!”\n    they will claim.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Will you let them get away with this forever?\n    Will they succeed forever\
      \ in their heartless conquests?"
  2:
    1: "¹ I will climb up to my watchtower\n    and stand at my guardpost.\nThere\
      \ I will wait to see what the Lord says\n    and how he will answer my complaint.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Then the Lord said to me,\n“Write my answer plainly on tablets,\n    so\
      \ that a runner can carry the correct message to others.\n"
    3: "³ This vision is for a future time.\n    It describes the end, and it will\
      \ be fulfilled.\nIf it seems slow in coming, wait patiently,\n    for it will\
      \ surely take place.\n    It will not be delayed. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Look at the proud!\n    They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked.\n\
      \    But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God.\n"
    5: "⁵ Wealth is treacherous,\n    and the arrogant are never at rest.\nThey open\
      \ their mouths as wide as the grave,\n    and like death, they are never satisfied.\n\
      In their greed they have gathered up many nations\n    and swallowed many peoples.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ “But soon their captives will taunt them.\n    They will mock them, saying,\n\
      ‘What sorrow awaits you thieves!\n    Now you will get what you deserve!\nYou’ve\
      \ become rich by extortion,\n    but how much longer can this go on?’\n"
    7: "⁷ Suddenly, your debtors will take action.\n    They will turn on you and\
      \ take all you have,\n    while you stand trembling and helpless.\n"
    8: "⁸ Because you have plundered many nations,\n    now all the survivors will\
      \ plunder you.\nYou committed murder throughout the countryside\n    and filled\
      \ the towns with violence. \n"
    9: "⁹ “What sorrow awaits you who build big houses\n    with money gained dishonestly!\n\
      You believe your wealth will buy security,\n    putting your family’s nest beyond\
      \ the reach of danger.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But by the murders you committed,\n    you have shamed your name and forfeited\
      \ your lives.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The very stones in the walls cry out against you,\n    and the beams in\
      \ the ceilings echo the complaint. \n"
    12: "¹² “What sorrow awaits you who build cities\n    with money gained through\
      \ murder and corruption!\n"
    13: "¹³ Has not the Lord of Heaven’s Armies promised\n    that the wealth of nations\
      \ will turn to ashes?\nThey work so hard,\n    but all in vain!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For as the waters fill the sea,\n    the earth will be filled with an\
      \ awareness\n    of the glory of the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “What sorrow awaits you who make your neighbors drunk!\n    You force\
      \ your cup on them\n    so you can gloat over their shameful nakedness.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced.\n    Come, drink and be\
      \ exposed!\nDrink from the cup of the Lord’s judgment,\n    and all your glory\
      \ will be turned to shame.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ You cut down the forests of Lebanon.\n    Now you will be cut down.\n\
      You destroyed the wild animals,\n    so now their terror will be yours.\nYou\
      \ committed murder throughout the countryside\n    and filled the towns with\
      \ violence. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “What good is an idol carved by man,\n    or a cast image that deceives\
      \ you?\nHow foolish to trust in your own creation—\n    a god that can’t even\
      \ talk!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ What sorrow awaits you who say to wooden idols,\n    ‘Wake up and save\
      \ us!’\nTo speechless stone images you say,\n    ‘Rise up and teach us!’\n \
      \   Can an idol tell you what to do?\nThey may be overlaid with gold and silver,\n\
      \    but they are lifeless inside.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord is in his holy Temple.\n    Let all the earth be silent before\
      \ him.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ This prayer was sung by the prophet Habakkuk: \n"
    2: "² I have heard all about you, Lord.\n    I am filled with awe by your amazing\
      \ works.\nIn this time of our deep need,\n    help us again as you did in years\
      \ gone by.\nAnd in your anger,\n    remember your mercy. \n"
    3: "³ I see God moving across the deserts from Edom,\n    the Holy One coming\
      \ from Mount Paran.\nHis brilliant splendor fills the heavens,\n    and the\
      \ earth is filled with his praise.\n"
    4: "⁴ His coming is as brilliant as the sunrise.\n    Rays of light flash from\
      \ his hands,\n    where his awesome power is hidden.\n"
    5: "⁵ Pestilence marches before him;\n    plague follows close behind.\n"
    6: "⁶ When he stops, the earth shakes.\n    When he looks, the nations tremble.\n\
      He shatters the everlasting mountains\n    and levels the eternal hills.\n \
      \   He is the Eternal One!\n"
    7: "⁷ I see the people of Cushan in distress,\n    and the nation of Midian trembling\
      \ in terror. \n"
    8: "⁸ Was it in anger, Lord, that you struck the rivers\n    and parted the sea?\n\
      Were you displeased with them?\n    No, you were sending your chariots of salvation!\n"
    9: "⁹ You brandished your bow\n    and your quiver of arrows.\n    You split open\
      \ the earth with flowing rivers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The mountains watched and trembled.\n    Onward swept the raging waters.\n\
      The mighty deep cried out,\n    lifting its hands in submission.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The sun and moon stood still in the sky\n    as your brilliant arrows\
      \ flew\n    and your glittering spear flashed. \n"
    12: "¹² You marched across the land in anger\n    and trampled the nations in\
      \ your fury.\n"
    13: "¹³ You went out to rescue your chosen people,\n    to save your anointed\
      \ ones.\nYou crushed the heads of the wicked\n    and stripped their bones from\
      \ head to toe.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With his own weapons,\n    you destroyed the chief of those\nwho rushed\
      \ out like a whirlwind,\n    thinking Israel would be easy prey.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You trampled the sea with your horses,\n    and the mighty waters piled\
      \ high. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I trembled inside when I heard this;\n    my lips quivered with fear.\n\
      My legs gave way beneath me,\n    and I shook in terror.\nI will wait quietly\
      \ for the coming day\n    when disaster will strike the people who invade us.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Even though the fig trees have no blossoms,\n    and there are no grapes\
      \ on the vines;\neven though the olive crop fails,\n    and the fields lie empty\
      \ and barren;\neven though the flocks die in the fields,\n    and the cattle\
      \ barns are empty,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ yet I will rejoice in the Lord!\n    I will be joyful in the God of my\
      \ salvation!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Sovereign Lord is my strength!\n    He makes me as surefooted as a\
      \ deer,\n    able to tread upon the heights.\n(For the choir director: This\
      \ prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)"
