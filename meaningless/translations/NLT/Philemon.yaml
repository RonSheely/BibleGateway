Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ This letter is from Paul, a prisoner for preaching the Good News about Christ\
      \ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.\nI am writing to Philemon, our beloved\
      \ co-worker, "
    2: "² and to our sister Apphia, and to our fellow soldier Archippus, and to the\
      \ church that meets in your house. \n"
    3: "³ May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. \n"
    4: '⁴ I always thank my God when I pray for you, Philemon, '
    5: '⁵ because I keep hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love
      for all of God’s people. '
    6: '⁶ And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes
      from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have
      in Christ. '
    7: "⁷ Your love has given me much joy and comfort, my brother, for your kindness\
      \ has often refreshed the hearts of God’s people. \n"
    8: '⁸ That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you. I could demand it in the
      name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do. '
    9: "⁹ But because of our love, I prefer simply to ask you. Consider this as a\
      \ request from me—Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ\
      \ Jesus. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I appeal to you to show kindness to my child, Onesimus. I became his father
      in the faith while here in prison. '
    11: '¹¹ Onesimus hasn’t been of much use to you in the past, but now he is very
      useful to both of us. '
    12: "¹² I am sending him back to you, and with him comes my own heart. \n"
    13: '¹³ I wanted to keep him here with me while I am in these chains for preaching
      the Good News, and he would have helped me on your behalf. '
    14: '¹⁴ But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent. I wanted you to
      help because you were willing, not because you were forced. '
    15: '¹⁵ It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him
      back forever. '
    16: "¹⁶ He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is\
      \ a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he will mean much more to you, both\
      \ as a man and as a brother in the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. '
    18: '¹⁸ If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me. '
    19: "¹⁹ I, PAUL, WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND: I WILL REPAY IT. AND I WON’T MENTION\
      \ THAT YOU OWE ME YOUR VERY SOUL! \n"
    20: "²⁰ Yes, my brother, please do me this favor for the Lord’s sake. Give me\
      \ this encouragement in Christ. \n"
    21: '²¹ I am confident as I write this letter that you will do what I ask and
      even more! '
    22: "²² One more thing—please prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that\
      \ God will answer your prayers and let me return to you soon. \n"
    23: '²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. '
    24: "²⁴ So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
