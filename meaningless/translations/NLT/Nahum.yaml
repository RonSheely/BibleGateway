Nahum:
  1:
    1: "¹ This message concerning Nineveh came as a vision to Nahum, who lived in\
      \ Elkosh. \n"
    2: "² The Lord is a jealous God,\n    filled with vengeance and rage.\nHe takes\
      \ revenge on all who oppose him\n    and continues to rage against his enemies!\n"
    3: "³ The Lord is slow to get angry, but his power is great,\n    and he never\
      \ lets the guilty go unpunished.\nHe displays his power in the whirlwind and\
      \ the storm.\n    The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ At his command the oceans dry up,\n    and the rivers disappear.\nThe lush\
      \ pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade,\n    and the green forests of Lebanon\
      \ wither.\n"
    5: "⁵ In his presence the mountains quake,\n    and the hills melt away;\nthe\
      \ earth trembles,\n    and its people are destroyed.\n"
    6: "⁶ Who can stand before his fierce anger?\n    Who can survive his burning\
      \ fury?\nHis rage blazes forth like fire,\n    and the mountains crumble to\
      \ dust in his presence. \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord is good,\n    a strong refuge when trouble comes.\n    He is close\
      \ to those who trust in him.\n"
    8: "⁸ But he will sweep away his enemies\n    in an overwhelming flood.\nHe will\
      \ pursue his foes\n    into the darkness of night. \n"
    9: "⁹ Why are you scheming against the Lord?\n    He will destroy you with one\
      \ blow;\n    he won’t need to strike twice!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ His enemies, tangled like thornbushes\n    and staggering like drunks,\n\
      \    will be burned up like dry stubble in a field.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Who is this wicked counselor of yours\n    who plots evil against the\
      \ Lord? \n"
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“Though the Assyrians have many allies,\n\
      \    they will be destroyed and disappear.\nO my people, I have punished you\
      \ before,\n    but I will not punish you again.\n"
    13: "¹³ Now I will break the yoke of bondage from your neck\n    and tear off\
      \ the chains of Assyrian oppression.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ And this is what the Lord says concerning the Assyrians in Nineveh:\n\
      “You will have no more children to carry on your name.\n    I will destroy all\
      \ the idols in the temples of your gods.\nI am preparing a grave for you\n \
      \   because you are despicable!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Look! A messenger is coming over the mountains with good news!\n    He\
      \ is bringing a message of peace.\nCelebrate your festivals, O people of Judah,\n\
      \    and fulfill all your vows,\nfor your wicked enemies will never invade your\
      \ land again.\n    They will be completely destroyed!"
  2:
    1: "¹ Your enemy is coming to crush you, Nineveh.\n    Man the ramparts! Watch\
      \ the roads!\n    Prepare your defenses! Call out your forces! \n"
    2: "² Even though the destroyer has destroyed Judah,\n    the Lord will restore\
      \ its honor.\nIsrael’s vine has been stripped of branches,\n    but he will\
      \ restore its splendor. \n"
    3: "³ Shields flash red in the sunlight!\n    See the scarlet uniforms of the\
      \ valiant troops!\nWatch as their glittering chariots move into position,\n\
      \    with a forest of spears waving above them.\n"
    4: "⁴ The chariots race recklessly along the streets\n    and rush wildly through\
      \ the squares.\nThey flash like firelight\n    and move as swiftly as lightning.\n"
    5: "⁵ The king shouts to his officers;\n    they stumble in their haste,\n   \
      \ rushing to the walls to set up their defenses.\n"
    6: "⁶ The river gates have been torn open!\n    The palace is about to collapse!\n"
    7: "⁷ Nineveh’s exile has been decreed,\n    and all the servant girls mourn its\
      \ capture.\nThey moan like doves\n    and beat their breasts in sorrow.\n"
    8: "⁸ Nineveh is like a leaking water reservoir!\n    The people are slipping\
      \ away.\n“Stop, stop!” someone shouts,\n    but no one even looks back.\n"
    9: "⁹ Loot the silver!\n    Plunder the gold!\nThere’s no end to Nineveh’s treasures—\n\
      \    its vast, uncounted wealth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Soon the city is plundered, empty, and ruined.\n    Hearts melt and knees\
      \ shake.\nThe people stand aghast,\n    their faces pale and trembling. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Where now is that great Nineveh,\n    that den filled with young lions?\n\
      It was a place where people—like lions and their cubs—\n    walked freely and\
      \ without fear.\n"
    12: "¹² The lion tore up meat for his cubs\n    and strangled prey for his mate.\n\
      He filled his den with prey,\n    his caverns with his plunder. \n"
    13: "¹³ “I am your enemy!”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n“Your chariots\
      \ will soon go up in smoke.\n    Your young men will be killed in battle.\n\
      Never again will you plunder conquered nations.\n    The voices of your proud\
      \ messengers will be heard no more.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ What sorrow awaits Nineveh,\n    the city of murder and lies!\nShe is crammed\
      \ with wealth\n    and is never without victims.\n"
    2: "² Hear the crack of whips,\n    the rumble of wheels!\nHorses’ hooves pound,\n\
      \    and chariots clatter wildly.\n"
    3: "³ See the flashing swords and glittering spears\n    as the charioteers charge\
      \ past!\nThere are countless casualties,\n    heaps of bodies—\nso many bodies\
      \ that\n    people stumble over them.\n"
    4: "⁴ All this because Nineveh,\n    the beautiful and faithless city,\nmistress\
      \ of deadly charms,\n    enticed the nations with her beauty.\nShe taught them\
      \ all her magic,\n    enchanting people everywhere. \n"
    5: "⁵ “I am your enemy!”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n“And now I will\
      \ lift your skirts\n    and show all the earth your nakedness and shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will cover you with filth\n    and show the world how vile you really\
      \ are.\n"
    7: "⁷ All who see you will shrink back and say,\n    ‘Nineveh lies in ruins.\n\
      Where are the mourners?’\n    Does anyone regret your destruction?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Are you any better than the city of Thebes,\n    situated on the Nile River,\
      \ surrounded by water?\nShe was protected by the river on all sides,\n    walled\
      \ in by water.\n"
    9: "⁹ Ethiopia and the land of Egypt\n    gave unlimited assistance.\nThe nations\
      \ of Put and Libya\n    were among her allies.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet Thebes fell,\n    and her people were led away as captives.\nHer babies\
      \ were dashed to death\n    against the stones of the streets.\nSoldiers threw\
      \ dice to get Egyptian officers as servants.\n    All their leaders were bound\
      \ in chains. \n"
    11: "¹¹ And you, Nineveh, will also stagger like a drunkard.\n    You will hide\
      \ for fear of the attacking enemy.\n"
    12: "¹² All your fortresses will fall.\n    They will be devoured like the ripe\
      \ figs\nthat fall into the mouths\n    of those who shake the trees.\n"
    13: "¹³ Your troops will be as weak\n    and helpless as women.\nThe gates of\
      \ your land will be opened wide to the enemy\n    and set on fire and burned.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Get ready for the siege!\n    Store up water!\n    Strengthen the defenses!\n\
      Go into the pits to trample clay,\n    and pack it into molds,\n    making bricks\
      \ to repair the walls. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But the fire will devour you;\n    the sword will cut you down.\nThe enemy\
      \ will consume you like locusts,\n    devouring everything they see.\nThere\
      \ will be no escape,\n    even if you multiply like swarming locusts.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Your merchants have multiplied\n    until they outnumber the stars.\n\
      But like a swarm of locusts,\n    they strip the land and fly away.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your guards and officials are also like swarming locusts\n    that crowd\
      \ together in the hedges on a cold day.\nBut like locusts that fly away when\
      \ the sun comes up,\n    all of them will fly away and disappear. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your shepherds are asleep, O Assyrian king;\n    your princes lie dead\
      \ in the dust.\nYour people are scattered across the mountains\n    with no\
      \ one to gather them together.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ There is no healing for your wound;\n    your injury is fatal.\nAll who\
      \ hear of your destruction\n    will clap their hands for joy.\nWhere can anyone\
      \ be found\n    who has not suffered from your continual cruelty?"
