Job:
  1:
    1: '¹ There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless—a
      man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil. '
    2: '² He had seven sons and three daughters. '
    3: "³ He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys.\
      \ He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire\
      \ area. \n"
    4: '⁴ Job’s sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would
      also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them. '
    5: "⁵ When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify\
      \ his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering\
      \ for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned\
      \ and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice. \n"
    6: '⁶ One day the members of the heavenly court came to present themselves before
      the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them. '
    7: "⁷ “Where have you come from?” the Lord asked Satan.\nSatan answered the Lord,\
      \ “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then the Lord asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest\
      \ man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears\
      \ God and stays away from evil.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Satan replied to the Lord, “Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God. '
    10: '¹⁰ You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his
      property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he
      is! '
    11: "¹¹ But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse\
      \ you to your face!” \n"
    12: "¹² “All right, you may test him,” the Lord said to Satan. “Do whatever you\
      \ want with everything he possesses, but don’t harm him physically.” So Satan\
      \ left the Lord’s presence. \n"
    13: '¹³ One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother’s
      house, '
    14: '¹⁴ a messenger arrived at Job’s home with this news: “Your oxen were plowing,
      with the donkeys feeding beside them, '
    15: "¹⁵ when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all\
      \ the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news:\
      \ “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the\
      \ shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news:\
      \ “Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants.\
      \ I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news:
      “Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother’s home. '
    19: "¹⁹ Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house\
      \ on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the\
      \ only one who escaped to tell you.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell
      to the ground to worship. '
    21: "²¹ He said, \n“I came naked from my mother’s womb,\n    and I will be naked\
      \ when I leave.\nThe Lord gave me what I had,\n    and the Lord has taken it\
      \ away.\nPraise the name of the Lord!” \n"
    22: ²² In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God.
  2:
    1: '¹ One day the members of the heavenly court came again to present themselves
      before the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them. '
    2: "² “Where have you come from?” the Lord asked Satan.\nSatan answered the Lord,\
      \ “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.” \n"
    3: "³ Then the Lord asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest\
      \ man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears\
      \ God and stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though\
      \ you urged me to harm him without cause.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Satan replied to the Lord, “Skin for skin! A man will give up everything
      he has to save his life. '
    5: "⁵ But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to\
      \ your face!” \n"
    6: '⁶ “All right, do with him as you please,” the Lord said to Satan. “But spare
      his life.” '
    7: "⁷ So Satan left the Lord’s presence, and he struck Job with terrible boils\
      \ from head to foot. \n"
    8: '⁸ Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the
      ashes. '
    9: "⁹ His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to maintain your integrity?\
      \ Curse God and die.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ But Job replied, “You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only\
      \ good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?” So in all this,\
      \ Job said nothing wrong. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When three of Job’s friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they
      got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him. Their
      names were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. '
    12: '¹² When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognized him. Wailing
      loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to
      show their grief. '
    13: ¹³ Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one
      said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words.
  3:
    1: '¹ At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth. '
    2: "² He said: \n"
    3: "³ “Let the day of my birth be erased,\n    and the night I was conceived.\n"
    4: "⁴ Let that day be turned to darkness.\n    Let it be lost even to God on high,\n\
      \    and let no light shine on it.\n"
    5: "⁵ Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own.\n    Let a\
      \ black cloud overshadow it,\n    and let the darkness terrify it.\n"
    6: "⁶ Let that night be blotted off the calendar,\n    never again to be counted\
      \ among the days of the year,\n    never again to appear among the months.\n"
    7: "⁷ Let that night be childless.\n    Let it have no joy.\n"
    8: "⁸ Let those who are experts at cursing—\n    whose cursing could rouse Leviathan—\n\
      \    curse that day.\n"
    9: "⁹ Let its morning stars remain dark.\n    Let it hope for light, but in vain;\n\
      \    may it never see the morning light.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Curse that day for failing to shut my mother’s womb,\n    for letting\
      \ me be born to see all this trouble. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Why wasn’t I born dead?\n    Why didn’t I die as I came from the womb?\n"
    12: "¹² Why was I laid on my mother’s lap?\n    Why did she nurse me at her breasts?\n"
    13: "¹³ Had I died at birth, I would now be at peace.\n    I would be asleep and\
      \ at rest.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I would rest with the world’s kings and prime ministers,\n    whose great\
      \ buildings now lie in ruins.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I would rest with princes, rich in gold,\n    whose palaces were filled\
      \ with silver.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Why wasn’t I buried like a stillborn child,\n    like a baby who never\
      \ lives to see the light?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For in death the wicked cause no trouble,\n    and the weary are at rest.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Even captives are at ease in death,\n    with no guards to curse them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Rich and poor are both there,\n    and the slave is free from his master.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Oh, why give light to those in misery,\n    and life to those who are\
      \ bitter?\n"
    21: "²¹ They long for death, and it won’t come.\n    They search for death more\
      \ eagerly than for hidden treasure.\n"
    22: "²² They’re filled with joy when they finally die,\n    and rejoice when they\
      \ find the grave.\n"
    23: "²³ Why is life given to those with no future,\n    those God has surrounded\
      \ with difficulties?\n"
    24: "²⁴ I cannot eat for sighing;\n    my groans pour out like water.\n"
    25: "²⁵ What I always feared has happened to me.\n    What I dreaded has come\
      \ true.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I have no peace, no quietness.\n    I have no rest; only trouble comes.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied to Job: \n"
    2: "² “Will you be patient and let me say a word?\n    For who could keep from\
      \ speaking out? \n"
    3: "³ “In the past you have encouraged many people;\n    you have strengthened\
      \ those who were weak.\n"
    4: "⁴ Your words have supported those who were falling;\n    you encouraged those\
      \ with shaky knees.\n"
    5: "⁵ But now when trouble strikes, you lose heart.\n    You are terrified when\
      \ it touches you.\n"
    6: "⁶ Doesn’t your reverence for God give you confidence?\n    Doesn’t your life\
      \ of integrity give you hope? \n"
    7: "⁷ “Stop and think! Do the innocent die?\n    When have the upright been destroyed?\n"
    8: "⁸ My experience shows that those who plant trouble\n    and cultivate evil\
      \ will harvest the same.\n"
    9: "⁹ A breath from God destroys them.\n    They vanish in a blast of his anger.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The lion roars and the wildcat snarls,\n    but the teeth of strong lions\
      \ will be broken.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The fierce lion will starve for lack of prey,\n    and the cubs of the\
      \ lioness will be scattered. \n"
    12: "¹² “This truth was given to me in secret,\n    as though whispered in my\
      \ ear.\n"
    13: "¹³ It came to me in a disturbing vision at night,\n    when people are in\
      \ a deep sleep.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Fear gripped me,\n    and my bones trembled.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ A spirit swept past my face,\n    and my hair stood on end.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The spirit stopped, but I couldn’t see its shape.\n    There was a form\
      \ before my eyes.\nIn the silence I heard a voice say,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘Can a mortal be innocent before God?\n    Can anyone be pure before the\
      \ Creator?’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “If God does not trust his own angels\n    and has charged his messengers\
      \ with foolishness,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ how much less will he trust people made of clay!\n    They are made of\
      \ dust, crushed as easily as a moth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They are alive in the morning but dead by evening,\n    gone forever without\
      \ a trace.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their tent-cords are pulled and the tent collapses,\n    and they die\
      \ in ignorance."
  5:
    1: "¹ “Cry for help, but will anyone answer you?\n    Which of the angels will\
      \ help you?\n"
    2: "² Surely resentment destroys the fool,\n    and jealousy kills the simple.\n"
    3: "³ I have seen that fools may be successful for the moment,\n    but then comes\
      \ sudden disaster.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their children are abandoned far from help;\n    they are crushed in court\
      \ with no one to defend them.\n"
    5: "⁵ The hungry devour their harvest,\n    even when it is guarded by brambles.\n\
      \    The thirsty pant after their wealth.\n"
    6: "⁶ But evil does not spring from the soil,\n    and trouble does not sprout\
      \ from the earth.\n"
    7: "⁷ People are born for trouble\n    as readily as sparks fly up from a fire.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “If I were you, I would go to God\n    and present my case to him.\n"
    9: "⁹ He does great things too marvelous to understand.\n    He performs countless\
      \ miracles.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He gives rain for the earth\n    and water for the fields.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He gives prosperity to the poor\n    and protects those who suffer.\n"
    12: "¹² He frustrates the plans of schemers\n    so the work of their hands will\
      \ not succeed.\n"
    13: "¹³ He traps the wise in their own cleverness\n    so their cunning schemes\
      \ are thwarted.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They find it is dark in the daytime,\n    and they grope at noon as if\
      \ it were night.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He rescues the poor from the cutting words of the strong,\n    and rescues\
      \ them from the clutches of the powerful.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And so at last the poor have hope,\n    and the snapping jaws of the wicked\
      \ are shut. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “But consider the joy of those corrected by God!\n    Do not despise the\
      \ discipline of the Almighty when you sin.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For though he wounds, he also bandages.\n    He strikes, but his hands\
      \ also heal.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ From six disasters he will rescue you;\n    even in the seventh, he will\
      \ keep you from evil.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He will save you from death in time of famine,\n    from the power of\
      \ the sword in time of war.\n"
    21: "²¹ You will be safe from slander\n    and have no fear when destruction comes.\n"
    22: "²² You will laugh at destruction and famine;\n    wild animals will not terrify\
      \ you.\n"
    23: "²³ You will be at peace with the stones of the field,\n    and its wild animals\
      \ will be at peace with you.\n"
    24: "²⁴ You will know that your home is safe.\n    When you survey your possessions,\
      \ nothing will be missing.\n"
    25: "²⁵ You will have many children;\n    your descendants will be as plentiful\
      \ as grass!\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will go to the grave at a ripe old age,\n    like a sheaf of grain\
      \ harvested at the proper time! \n"
    27: "²⁷ “We have studied life and found all this to be true.\n    Listen to my\
      \ counsel, and apply it to yourself.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Then Job spoke again: \n"
    2: "² “If my misery could be weighed\n    and my troubles be put on the scales,\n"
    3: "³ they would outweigh all the sands of the sea.\n    That is why I spoke impulsively.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the Almighty has struck me down with his arrows.\n    Their poison infects\
      \ my spirit.\n    God’s terrors are lined up against me.\n"
    5: "⁵ Don’t I have a right to complain?\n    Don’t wild donkeys bray when they\
      \ find no grass,\n    and oxen bellow when they have no food?\n"
    6: "⁶ Don’t people complain about unsalted food?\n    Does anyone want the tasteless\
      \ white of an egg?\n"
    7: "⁷ My appetite disappears when I look at it;\n    I gag at the thought of eating\
      \ it! \n"
    8: "⁸ “Oh, that I might have my request,\n    that God would grant my desire.\n"
    9: "⁹ I wish he would crush me.\n    I wish he would reach out his hand and kill\
      \ me.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ At least I can take comfort in this:\n    Despite the pain,\n    I have\
      \ not denied the words of the Holy One.\n"
    11: "¹¹ But I don’t have the strength to endure.\n    I have nothing to live for.\n"
    12: "¹² Do I have the strength of a stone?\n    Is my body made of bronze?\n"
    13: "¹³ No, I am utterly helpless,\n    without any chance of success. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “One should be kind to a fainting friend,\n    but you accuse me without\
      \ any fear of the Almighty.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ My brothers, you have proved as unreliable as a seasonal brook\n    that\
      \ overflows its banks in the spring\n"
    16: "¹⁶     when it is swollen with ice and melting snow.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ But when the hot weather arrives, the water disappears.\n    The brook\
      \ vanishes in the heat.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The caravans turn aside to be refreshed,\n    but there is nothing to\
      \ drink, so they die.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The caravans from Tema search for this water;\n    the travelers from\
      \ Sheba hope to find it.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They count on it but are disappointed.\n    When they arrive, their hopes\
      \ are dashed.\n"
    21: "²¹ You, too, have given no help.\n    You have seen my calamity, and you\
      \ are afraid.\n"
    22: "²² But why? Have I ever asked you for a gift?\n    Have I begged for anything\
      \ of yours for myself?\n"
    23: "²³ Have I asked you to rescue me from my enemies,\n    or to save me from\
      \ ruthless people?\n"
    24: "²⁴ Teach me, and I will keep quiet.\n    Show me what I have done wrong.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Honest words can be painful,\n    but what do your criticisms amount to?\n"
    26: "²⁶ Do you think your words are convincing\n    when you disregard my cry\
      \ of desperation?\n"
    27: "²⁷ You would even send an orphan into slavery\n    or sell a friend.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Look at me!\n    Would I lie to your face?\n"
    29: "²⁹ Stop assuming my guilt,\n    for I have done no wrong.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Do you think I am lying?\n    Don’t I know the difference between right\
      \ and wrong?"
  7:
    1: "¹ “Is not all human life a struggle?\n    Our lives are like that of a hired\
      \ hand,\n"
    2: "² like a worker who longs for the shade,\n    like a servant waiting to be\
      \ paid.\n"
    3: "³ I, too, have been assigned months of futility,\n    long and weary nights\
      \ of misery.\n"
    4: "⁴ Lying in bed, I think, ‘When will it be morning?’\n    But the night drags\
      \ on, and I toss till dawn.\n"
    5: "⁵ My body is covered with maggots and scabs.\n    My skin breaks open, oozing\
      \ with pus. \n"
    6: "⁶ “My days fly faster than a weaver’s shuttle.\n    They end without hope.\n"
    7: "⁷ O God, remember that my life is but a breath,\n    and I will never again\
      \ feel happiness.\n"
    8: "⁸ You see me now, but not for long.\n    You will look for me, but I will\
      \ be gone.\n"
    9: "⁹ Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes,\n    those who die will not come\
      \ back.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They are gone forever from their home—\n    never to be seen again. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “I cannot keep from speaking.\n    I must express my anguish.\n    My\
      \ bitter soul must complain.\n"
    12: "¹² Am I a sea monster or a dragon\n    that you must place me under guard?\n"
    13: "¹³ I think, ‘My bed will comfort me,\n    and sleep will ease my misery,’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ but then you shatter me with dreams\n    and terrify me with visions.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I would rather be strangled—\n    rather die than suffer like this.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I hate my life and don’t want to go on living.\n    Oh, leave me alone\
      \ for my few remaining days. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “What are people, that you should make so much of us,\n    that you should\
      \ think of us so often?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For you examine us every morning\n    and test us every moment.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Why won’t you leave me alone,\n    at least long enough for me to swallow!\n"
    20: "²⁰ If I have sinned, what have I done to you,\n    O watcher of all humanity?\n\
      Why make me your target?\n    Am I a burden to you?\n"
    21: "²¹ Why not just forgive my sin\n    and take away my guilt?\nFor soon I will\
      \ lie down in the dust and die.\n    When you look for me, I will be gone.”"
  8:
    1: "¹ Then Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job: \n"
    2: "² “How long will you go on like this?\n    You sound like a blustering wind.\n"
    3: "³ Does God twist justice?\n    Does the Almighty twist what is right?\n"
    4: "⁴ Your children must have sinned against him,\n    so their punishment was\
      \ well deserved.\n"
    5: "⁵ But if you pray to God\n    and seek the favor of the Almighty,\n"
    6: "⁶ and if you are pure and live with integrity,\n    he will surely rise up\
      \ and restore your happy home.\n"
    7: "⁷ And though you started with little,\n    you will end with much. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Just ask the previous generation.\n    Pay attention to the experience\
      \ of our ancestors.\n"
    9: "⁹ For we were born but yesterday and know nothing.\n    Our days on earth\
      \ are as fleeting as a shadow.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But those who came before us will teach you.\n    They will teach you\
      \ the wisdom of old. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Can papyrus reeds grow tall without a marsh?\n    Can marsh grass flourish\
      \ without water?\n"
    12: "¹² While they are still flowering, not ready to be cut,\n    they begin to\
      \ wither more quickly than grass.\n"
    13: "¹³ The same happens to all who forget God.\n    The hopes of the godless\
      \ evaporate.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Their confidence hangs by a thread.\n    They are leaning on a spider’s\
      \ web.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ They cling to their home for security, but it won’t last.\n    They try\
      \ to hold it tight, but it will not endure.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine,\n    its branches\
      \ spreading across the garden.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Its roots grow down through a pile of stones;\n    it takes hold on a\
      \ bed of rocks.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But when it is uprooted,\n    it’s as though it never existed!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ That’s the end of its life,\n    and others spring up from the earth to\
      \ replace it. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “But look, God will not reject a person of integrity,\n    nor will he\
      \ lend a hand to the wicked.\n"

    10: "¹⁰ If God comes and puts a person in prison\n    or calls the court to order,\

    19: "¹⁹ “‘Well,’ you say, ‘at least God will punish their children!’\n    But\

    20: "²⁰ Let them see their destruction with their own eyes.\n    Let them drink\

    1: "¹ Job’s three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting\

    2: '² Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became angry.
      He was angry because Job refused to admit that he had sinned and that God was
      right in punishing him. '
    3: '³ He was also angry with Job’s three friends, for they made God appear to
      be wrong by their inability to answer Job’s arguments. '
    4: '⁴ Elihu had waited for the others to speak to Job because they were older
      than he. '
    5: '⁵ But when he saw that they had no further reply, he spoke out angrily. '
    6: "⁶ Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said, \n“I am young and you are old,\n \

    7: "⁷ I thought, ‘Those who are older should speak,\n    for wisdom comes with\

    17: "¹⁷ No, I will say my piece.\n    I will speak my mind.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For I am full of pent-up words,\n    and the spirit within me urges me\

    13: "¹³ So why are you bringing a charge against him?\n    Why say he does not\

    14: "¹⁴ For God speaks again and again,\n    though people do not recognize it.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He speaks in dreams, in visions of the night,\n    when deep sleep falls\

    16: "¹⁶ He whispers in their ears\n    and terrifies them with warnings.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He makes them turn from doing wrong;\n    he keeps them from pride.\n"

    19: "¹⁹ “Or God disciplines people with pain on their sickbeds,\n    with ceaseless\

    20: "²⁰ They lose their appetite\n    for even the most delicious food.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their flesh wastes away,\n    and their bones stick out.\n"

    24: "²⁴ he will be gracious and say,\n‘Rescue him from the grave,\n    for I have\

    25: "²⁵ Then his body will become as healthy as a child’s,\n    firm and youthful\

    26: "²⁶ When he prays to God,\n    he will be accepted.\nAnd God will receive\

    27: "²⁷ He will declare to his friends,\n‘I sinned and twisted the truth,\n  \

    28: "²⁸ God rescued me from the grave,\n    and now my life is filled with light.’\

    29: "²⁹ “Yes, God does these things\n    again and again for people.\n"
    30: "³⁰ He rescues them from the grave\n    so they may enjoy the light of life.\n"
    31: "³¹ Mark this well, Job. Listen to me,\n    for I have more to say.\n"
    32: "³² But if you have anything to say, go ahead.\n    Speak, for I am anxious\

    33: "³³ But if not, then listen to me.\n    Keep silent and I will teach you wisdom!”"
  34:
    1: "¹ Then Elihu said: \n"

    4: "⁴ So let us discern for ourselves what is right;\n    let us learn together\

    5: "⁵ For Job also said, ‘I am innocent,\n    but God has taken away my rights.\n"

    12: "¹² Truly, God will not do wrong.\n    The Almighty will not twist justice.\n"
    13: "¹³ Did someone else put the world in his care?\n    Who set the whole world\
      \ in place?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ If God were to take back his spirit\n    and withdraw his breath,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ all life would cease,\n    and humanity would turn again to dust. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Now listen to me if you are wise.\n    Pay attention to what I say.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Could God govern if he hated justice?\n    Are you going to condemn the\
      \ almighty judge?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For he says to kings, ‘You are wicked,’\n    and to nobles, ‘You are unjust.’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He doesn’t care how great a person may be,\n    and he pays no more attention\
      \ to the rich than to the poor.\n    He made them all.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In a moment they die.\n    In the middle of the night they pass away;\n\
      \    the mighty are removed without human hand. \n"
    21: "²¹ “For God watches how people live;\n    he sees everything they do.\n"
    22: "²² No darkness is thick enough\n    to hide the wicked from his eyes.\n"
    23: "²³ We don’t set the time\n    when we will come before God in judgment.\n"
    24: "²⁴ He brings the mighty to ruin without asking anyone,\n    and he sets up\

    25: "²⁵ He knows what they do,\n    and in the night he overturns and destroys\
      \ them.\n"
    26: "²⁶ He strikes them down because they are wicked,\n    doing it openly for\
      \ all to see.\n"
    27: "²⁷ For they turned away from following him.\n    They have no respect for\
      \ any of his ways.\n"
    28: "²⁸ They cause the poor to cry out, catching God’s attention.\n    He hears\
      \ the cries of the needy.\n"
    29: "²⁹ But if he chooses to remain quiet,\n    who can criticize him?\nWhen he\
      \ hides his face, no one can find him,\n    whether an individual or a nation.\n"
    30: "³⁰ He prevents the godless from ruling\n    so they cannot be a snare to\
      \ the people. \n"
    31: "³¹ “Why don’t people say to God, ‘I have sinned,\n    but I will sin no more’?\n"
    32: "³² Or ‘I don’t know what evil I have done—tell me.\n    If I have done wrong,\

    33: "³³ “Must God tailor his justice to your demands?\n    But you have rejected\

    34: "³⁴ After all, bright people will tell me,\n    and wise people will hear\

    35: "³⁵ ‘Job speaks out of ignorance;\n    his words lack insight.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ Job, you deserve the maximum penalty\n    for the wicked way you have\
      \ talked.\n"
    37: "³⁷ For you have added rebellion to your sin;\n    you show no respect,\n\
      \    and you speak many angry words against God.”"
  35:
    1: "¹ Then Elihu said: \n"
    2: "² “Do you think it is right for you to claim,\n    ‘I am righteous before\

    6: "⁶ If you sin, how does that affect God?\n    Even if you sin again and again,\n\
      \    what effect will it have on him?\n"
    7: "⁷ If you are good, is this some great gift to him?\n    What could you possibly\
      \ give him?\n"
    8: "⁸ No, your sins affect only people like yourself,\n    and your good deeds\

    9: "⁹ “People cry out when they are oppressed.\n    They groan beneath the power\

    10: "¹⁰ Yet they don’t ask, ‘Where is God my Creator,\n    the one who gives songs\
      \ in the night?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Where is the one who makes us smarter than the animals\n    and wiser\
      \ than the birds of the sky?’\n"
    12: "¹² And when they cry out, God does not answer\n    because of their pride.\n"
    13: "¹³ But it is wrong to say God doesn’t listen,\n    to say the Almighty isn’t\
      \ concerned.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You say you can’t see him,\n    but he will bring justice if you will\
      \ only wait.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You say he does not respond to sinners with anger\n    and is not greatly\
      \ concerned about wickedness.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But you are talking nonsense, Job.\n    You have spoken like a fool.”"
  36:
    1: "¹ Elihu continued speaking: \n"

    7: "⁷ He never takes his eyes off the innocent,\n    but he sets them on thrones\

    8: "⁸ If they are bound in chains\n    and caught up in a web of trouble,\n"
    9: "⁹ he shows them the reason.\n    He shows them their sins of pride.\n"
