      \ season.\nTheir leaves never wither,\n    and they prosper in all they do.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁴ But not the wicked!\n    They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the\

    6: "⁵ They will be condemned at the time of judgment.\n    Sinners will have no\
      \ place among the godly.\n"
    7: "⁶ For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,\n    but the path of the\
      \ wicked leads to destruction."

      \ in Jerusalem, on my holy mountain.” \n"
    7: "⁷ The king proclaims the Lord’s decree:\n“The Lord said to me, ‘You are my\
      \ son.\n    Today I have become your Father.\n"
    8: "⁸ Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,\n    the\
      \ whole earth as your possession.\n"
    9: "⁹ You will break them with an iron rod\n    and smash them like clay pots.’”\
