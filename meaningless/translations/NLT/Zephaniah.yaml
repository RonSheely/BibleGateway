Zephaniah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The Lord gave this message to Zephaniah when Josiah son of Amon was king\
      \ of Judah. Zephaniah was the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah,\
      \ son of Hezekiah. \n"
    2: "² “I will sweep away everything\n    from the face of the earth,” says the\
      \ Lord.\n"
    3: "³ “I will sweep away people and animals alike.\n    I will sweep away the\
      \ birds of the sky and the fish in the sea.\nI will reduce the wicked to heaps\
      \ of rubble,\n    and I will wipe humanity from the face of the earth,” says\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ “I will crush Judah and Jerusalem with my fist\n    and destroy every last\
      \ trace of their Baal worship.\nI will put an end to all the idolatrous priests,\n\
      \    so that even the memory of them will disappear.\n"
    5: "⁵ For they go up to their roofs\n    and bow down to the sun, moon, and stars.\n\
      They claim to follow the Lord,\n    but then they worship Molech, too.\n"
    6: "⁶ And I will destroy those who used to worship me\n    but now no longer do.\n\
      They no longer ask for the Lord’s guidance\n    or seek my blessings.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Stand in silence in the presence of the Sovereign Lord,\n    for the awesome\
      \ day of the Lord’s judgment is near.\nThe Lord has prepared his people for\
      \ a great slaughter\n    and has chosen their executioners.\n"
    8: "⁸ “On that day of judgment,”\n    says the Lord,\n“I will punish the leaders\
      \ and princes of Judah\n    and all those following pagan customs.\n"
    9: "⁹ Yes, I will punish those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies,\n\
      \    and those who fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “On that day,” says the Lord,\n    “a cry of alarm will come from the\
      \ Fish Gate\nand echo throughout the New Quarter of the city.\n    And a great\
      \ crash will sound from the hills.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Wail in sorrow, all you who live in the market area,\n    for all the\
      \ merchants and traders will be destroyed. \n"
    12: "¹² “I will search with lanterns in Jerusalem’s darkest corners\n    to punish\
      \ those who sit complacent in their sins.\nThey think the Lord will do nothing\
      \ to them,\n    either good or bad.\n"
    13: "¹³ So their property will be plundered,\n    their homes will be ransacked.\n\
      They will build new homes\n    but never live in them.\nThey will plant vineyards\n\
      \    but never drink wine from them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “That terrible day of the Lord is near.\n    Swiftly it comes—\na day\
      \ of bitter tears,\n    a day when even strong men will cry out.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ It will be a day when the Lord’s anger is poured out—\n    a day of terrible\
      \ distress and anguish,\na day of ruin and desolation,\n    a day of darkness\
      \ and gloom,\na day of clouds and blackness,\n"
    16: "¹⁶     a day of trumpet calls and battle cries.\nDown go the walled cities\n\
      \    and the strongest battlements! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Because you have sinned against the Lord,\n    I will make you grope\
      \ around like the blind.\nYour blood will be poured into the dust,\n    and\
      \ your bodies will lie rotting on the ground.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your silver and gold will not save you\n    on that day of the Lord’s\
      \ anger.\nFor the whole land will be devoured\n    by the fire of his jealousy.\n\
      He will make a terrifying end\n    of all the people on earth."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather together—yes, gather together,\n    you shameless nation.\n"
    2: "² Gather before judgment begins,\n    before your time to repent is blown\
      \ away like chaff.\nAct now, before the fierce fury of the Lord falls\n    and\
      \ the terrible day of the Lord’s anger begins.\n"
    3: "³ Seek the Lord, all who are humble,\n    and follow his commands.\nSeek to\
      \ do what is right\n    and to live humbly.\nPerhaps even yet the Lord will\
      \ protect you—\n    protect you from his anger on that day of destruction. \n"
    4: "⁴ Gaza and Ashkelon will be abandoned,\n    Ashdod and Ekron torn down.\n"
    5: "⁵ And what sorrow awaits you Philistines\n    who live along the coast and\
      \ in the land of Canaan,\n    for this judgment is against you, too!\nThe Lord\
      \ will destroy you\n    until not one of you is left.\n"
    6: "⁶ The Philistine coast will become a wilderness pasture,\n    a place of shepherd\
      \ camps\n    and enclosures for sheep and goats.\n"
    7: "⁷ The remnant of the tribe of Judah will pasture there.\n    They will rest\
      \ at night in the abandoned houses in Ashkelon.\nFor the Lord their God will\
      \ visit his people in kindness\n    and restore their prosperity again. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I have heard the taunts of the Moabites\n    and the insults of the Ammonites,\n\
      mocking my people\n    and invading their borders.\n"
    9: "⁹ Now, as surely as I live,”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God\
      \ of Israel,\n“Moab and Ammon will be destroyed—\n    destroyed as completely\
      \ as Sodom and Gomorrah.\nTheir land will become a place of stinging nettles,\n\
      \    salt pits, and eternal desolation.\nThe remnant of my people will plunder\
      \ them\n    and take their land.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ They will receive the wages of their pride,\n    for they have scoffed\
      \ at the people of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will terrify them\n    as he destroys all the gods in the land.\n\
      Then nations around the world will worship the Lord,\n    each in their own\
      \ land. \n"
    12: "¹² “You Ethiopians will also be slaughtered\n    by my sword,” says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Lord will strike the lands of the north with his fist,\n    destroying\
      \ the land of Assyria.\nHe will make its great capital, Nineveh, a desolate\
      \ wasteland,\n    parched like a desert.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The proud city will become a pasture for flocks and herds,\n    and all\
      \ sorts of wild animals will settle there.\nThe desert owl and screech owl will\
      \ roost on its ruined columns,\n    their calls echoing through the gaping windows.\n\
      Rubble will block all the doorways,\n    and the cedar paneling will be exposed\
      \ to the weather.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is the boisterous city,\n    once so secure.\n“I am the greatest!”\
      \ it boasted.\n    “No other city can compare with me!”\nBut now, look how it\
      \ has become an utter ruin,\n    a haven for wild animals.\nEveryone passing\
      \ by will laugh in derision\n    and shake a defiant fist."
  3:
    1: "¹ What sorrow awaits rebellious, polluted Jerusalem,\n    the city of violence\
      \ and crime!\n"
    2: "² No one can tell it anything;\n    it refuses all correction.\nIt does not\
      \ trust in the Lord\n    or draw near to its God.\n"
    3: "³ Its leaders are like roaring lions\n    hunting for their victims.\nIts\
      \ judges are like ravenous wolves at evening time,\n    who by dawn have left\
      \ no trace of their prey.\n"
    4: "⁴ Its prophets are arrogant liars seeking their own gain.\n    Its priests\
      \ defile the Temple by disobeying God’s instructions.\n"
    5: "⁵ But the Lord is still there in the city,\n    and he does no wrong.\nDay\
      \ by day he hands down justice,\n    and he does not fail.\n    But the wicked\
      \ know no shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I have wiped out many nations,\n    devastating their fortress walls and\
      \ towers.\nTheir streets are now deserted;\n    their cities lie in silent ruin.\n\
      There are no survivors—\n    none at all.\n"
    7: "⁷ I thought, ‘Surely they will have reverence for me now!\n    Surely they\
      \ will listen to my warnings.\nThen I won’t need to strike again,\n    destroying\
      \ their homes.’\nBut no, they get up early\n    to continue their evil deeds.\n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore, be patient,” says the Lord.\n    “Soon I will stand and accuse\
      \ these evil nations.\nFor I have decided to gather the kingdoms of the earth\n\
      \    and pour out my fiercest anger and fury on them.\nAll the earth will be\
      \ devoured\n    by the fire of my jealousy. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Then I will purify the speech of all people,\n    so that everyone can\
      \ worship the Lord together.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ My scattered people who live beyond the rivers of Ethiopia\n    will come\
      \ to present their offerings.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On that day you will no longer need to be ashamed,\n    for you will no\
      \ longer be rebels against me.\nI will remove all proud and arrogant people\
      \ from among you.\n    There will be no more haughtiness on my holy mountain.\n"
    12: "¹² Those who are left will be the lowly and humble,\n    for it is they who\
      \ trust in the name of the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ The remnant of Israel will do no wrong;\n    they will never tell lies\
      \ or deceive one another.\nThey will eat and sleep in safety,\n    and no one\
      \ will make them afraid.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sing, O daughter of Zion;\n    shout aloud, O Israel!\nBe glad and rejoice\
      \ with all your heart,\n    O daughter of Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For the Lord will remove his hand of judgment\n    and will disperse the\
      \ armies of your enemy.\nAnd the Lord himself, the King of Israel,\n    will\
      \ live among you!\nAt last your troubles will be over,\n    and you will never\
      \ again fear disaster.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ On that day the announcement to Jerusalem will be,\n    “Cheer up, Zion!\
      \ Don’t be afraid!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the Lord your God is living among you.\n    He is a mighty savior.\n\
      He will take delight in you with gladness.\n    With his love, he will calm\
      \ all your fears.\n    He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I will gather you who mourn for the appointed festivals;\n    you will\
      \ be disgraced no more.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ And I will deal severely with all who have oppressed you.\n    I will\
      \ save the weak and helpless ones;\nI will bring together\n    those who were\
      \ chased away.\nI will give glory and fame to my former exiles,\n    wherever\
      \ they have been mocked and shamed.\n"
    20: "²⁰ On that day I will gather you together\n    and bring you home again.\n\
      I will give you a good name, a name of distinction,\n    among all the nations\
      \ of the earth,\nas I restore your fortunes before their very eyes.\n    I,\
      \ the Lord, have spoken!”"
