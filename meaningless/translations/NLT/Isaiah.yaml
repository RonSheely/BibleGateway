Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ These are the visions that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.\
      \ He saw these visions during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah\
      \ were kings of Judah. \n"
    2: "² Listen, O heavens! Pay attention, earth!\n    This is what the Lord says:\n\
      “The children I raised and cared for\n    have rebelled against me.\n"
    3: "³ Even an ox knows its owner,\n    and a donkey recognizes its master’s care—\n\
      but Israel doesn’t know its master.\n    My people don’t recognize my care for\
      \ them.”\n"
    4: "⁴ Oh, what a sinful nation they are—\n    loaded down with a burden of guilt.\n\
      They are evil people,\n    corrupt children who have rejected the Lord.\nThey\
      \ have despised the Holy One of Israel\n    and turned their backs on him. \n"
    5: "⁵ Why do you continue to invite punishment?\n    Must you rebel forever?\n\
      Your head is injured,\n    and your heart is sick.\n"
    6: "⁶ You are battered from head to foot—\n    covered with bruises, welts, and\
      \ infected wounds—\n    without any soothing ointments or bandages.\n"
    7: "⁷ Your country lies in ruins,\n    and your towns are burned.\nForeigners\
      \ plunder your fields before your eyes\n    and destroy everything they see.\n"
    8: "⁸ Beautiful Jerusalem stands abandoned\n    like a watchman’s shelter in a\
      \ vineyard,\nlike a lean-to in a cucumber field after the harvest,\n    like\
      \ a helpless city under siege.\n"
    9: "⁹ If the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    had not spared a few of us,\nwe would\
      \ have been wiped out like Sodom,\n    destroyed like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Listen to the Lord, you leaders of “Sodom.”\n    Listen to the law of\
      \ our God, people of “Gomorrah.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ “What makes you think I want all your sacrifices?”\n    says the Lord.\n\
      “I am sick of your burnt offerings of rams\n    and the fat of fattened cattle.\n\
      I get no pleasure from the blood\n    of bulls and lambs and goats.\n"
    12: "¹² When you come to worship me,\n    who asked you to parade through my courts\
      \ with all your ceremony?\n"
    13: "¹³ Stop bringing me your meaningless gifts;\n    the incense of your offerings\
      \ disgusts me!\nAs for your celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbath\n \
      \   and your special days for fasting—\nthey are all sinful and false.\n   \
      \ I want no more of your pious meetings.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I hate your new moon celebrations and your annual festivals.\n    They\
      \ are a burden to me. I cannot stand them!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ When you lift up your hands in prayer, I will not look.\n    Though you\
      \ offer many prayers, I will not listen,\n    for your hands are covered with\
      \ the blood of innocent victims.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wash yourselves and be clean!\n    Get your sins out of my sight.\n  \
      \  Give up your evil ways.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Learn to do good.\n    Seek justice.\nHelp the oppressed.\n    Defend\
      \ the cause of orphans.\n    Fight for the rights of widows. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Come now, let’s settle this,”\n    says the Lord.\n“Though your sins\
      \ are like scarlet,\n    I will make them as white as snow.\nThough they are\
      \ red like crimson,\n    I will make them as white as wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you will only obey me,\n    you will have plenty to eat.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But if you turn away and refuse to listen,\n    you will be devoured by\
      \ the sword of your enemies.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!” \n"
    21: "²¹ See how Jerusalem, once so faithful,\n    has become a prostitute.\nOnce\
      \ the home of justice and righteousness,\n    she is now filled with murderers.\n"
    22: "²² Once like pure silver,\n    you have become like worthless slag.\nOnce\
      \ so pure,\n    you are now like watered-down wine.\n"
    23: "²³ Your leaders are rebels,\n    the companions of thieves.\nAll of them\
      \ love bribes\n    and demand payoffs,\nbut they refuse to defend the cause\
      \ of orphans\n    or fight for the rights of widows. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    the Mighty One\
      \ of Israel, says,\n“I will take revenge on my enemies\n    and pay back my\
      \ foes!\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will raise my fist against you.\n    I will melt you down and skim off\
      \ your slag.\n    I will remove all your impurities.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Then I will give you good judges again\n    and wise counselors like you\
      \ used to have.\nThen Jerusalem will again be called the Home of Justice\n \
      \   and the Faithful City.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion will be restored by justice;\n    those who repent will be revived\
      \ by righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But rebels and sinners will be completely destroyed,\n    and those who\
      \ desert the Lord will be consumed. \n"
    29: "²⁹ You will be ashamed of your idol worship\n    in groves of sacred oaks.\n\
      You will blush because you worshiped\n    in gardens dedicated to idols.\n"
    30: "³⁰ You will be like a great tree with withered leaves,\n    like a garden\
      \ without water.\n"
    31: "³¹ The strongest among you will disappear like straw;\n    their evil deeds\
      \ will be the spark that sets it on fire.\nThey and their evil works will burn\
      \ up together,\n    and no one will be able to put out the fire."
  2:
    1: "¹ This is a vision that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:\
      \ \n"
    2: "² In the last days, the mountain of the Lord’s house\n    will be the highest\
      \ of all—\n    the most important place on earth.\nIt will be raised above the\
      \ other hills,\n    and people from all over the world will stream there to\
      \ worship.\n"
    3: "³ People from many nations will come and say,\n“Come, let us go up to the\
      \ mountain of the Lord,\n    to the house of Jacob’s God.\nThere he will teach\
      \ us his ways,\n    and we will walk in his paths.”\nFor the Lord’s teaching\
      \ will go out from Zion;\n    his word will go out from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord will mediate between nations\n    and will settle international\
      \ disputes.\nThey will hammer their swords into plowshares\n    and their spears\
      \ into pruning hooks.\nNation will no longer fight against nation,\n    nor\
      \ train for war anymore. \n"
    5: "⁵ Come, descendants of Jacob,\n    let us walk in the light of the Lord!\n"
    6: "⁶ For the Lord has rejected his people,\n    the descendants of Jacob,\nbecause\
      \ they have filled their land with practices from the East\n    and with sorcerers,\
      \ as the Philistines do.\n    They have made alliances with pagans.\n"
    7: "⁷ Israel is full of silver and gold;\n    there is no end to its treasures.\n\
      Their land is full of warhorses;\n    there is no end to its chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land is full of idols;\n    the people worship things they have made\n\
      \    with their own hands.\n"
    9: "⁹ So now they will be humbled,\n    and all will be brought low—\n    do not\
      \ forgive them.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Crawl into caves in the rocks.\n    Hide in the dust\nfrom the terror\
      \ of the Lord\n    and the glory of his majesty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Human pride will be brought down,\n    and human arrogance will be humbled.\n\
      Only the Lord will be exalted\n    on that day of judgment. \n"
    12: "¹² For the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    has a day of reckoning.\nHe will\
      \ punish the proud and mighty\n    and bring down everything that is exalted.\n"
    13: "¹³ He will cut down the tall cedars of Lebanon\n    and all the mighty oaks\
      \ of Bashan.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He will level all the high mountains\n    and all the lofty hills.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He will break down every high tower\n    and every fortified wall.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He will destroy all the great trading ships\n    and every magnificent\
      \ vessel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Human pride will be humbled,\n    and human arrogance will be brought\
      \ down.\nOnly the Lord will be exalted\n    on that day of judgment. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Idols will completely disappear.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ When the Lord rises to shake the earth,\n    his enemies will crawl into\
      \ holes in the ground.\nThey will hide in caves in the rocks\n    from the terror\
      \ of the Lord\n    and the glory of his majesty.\n"
    20: "²⁰ On that day of judgment they will abandon the gold and silver idols\n\
      \    they made for themselves to worship.\nThey will leave their gods to the\
      \ rodents and bats,\n"
    21: "²¹     while they crawl away into caverns\n    and hide among the jagged\
      \ rocks in the cliffs.\nThey will try to escape the terror of the Lord\n   \
      \ and the glory of his majesty\n    as he rises to shake the earth.\n"
    22: "²² Don’t put your trust in mere humans.\n    They are as frail as breath.\n\
      \    What good are they?"
  3:
    1: "¹ The Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    will take away from Jerusalem\
      \ and Judah\neverything they depend on:\n    every bit of bread\n    and every\
      \ drop of water,\n"
    2: "² all their heroes and soldiers,\n    judges and prophets,\n    fortune-tellers\
      \ and elders,\n"
    3: "³ army officers and high officials,\n    advisers, skilled sorcerers, and\
      \ astrologers. \n"
    4: "⁴ I will make boys their leaders,\n    and toddlers their rulers.\n"
    5: "⁵ People will oppress each other—\n    man against man,\n    neighbor against\
      \ neighbor.\nYoung people will insult their elders,\n    and vulgar people will\
      \ sneer at the honorable. \n"
    6: "⁶ In those days a man will say to his brother,\n“Since you have a coat, you\
      \ be our leader!\n    Take charge of this heap of ruins!”\n"
    7: "⁷ But he will reply,\n    “No! I can’t help.\nI don’t have any extra food\
      \ or clothes.\n    Don’t put me in charge!” \n"
    8: "⁸ For Jerusalem will stumble,\n    and Judah will fall,\nbecause they speak\
      \ out against the Lord and refuse to obey him.\n    They provoke him to his\
      \ face.\n"
    9: "⁹ The very look on their faces gives them away.\n    They display their sin\
      \ like the people of Sodom\n    and don’t even try to hide it.\nThey are doomed!\n\
      \    They have brought destruction upon themselves. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell the godly that all will be well for them.\n    They will enjoy the\
      \ rich reward they have earned!\n"
    11: "¹¹ But the wicked are doomed,\n    for they will get exactly what they deserve.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Childish leaders oppress my people,\n    and women rule over them.\nO\
      \ my people, your leaders mislead you;\n    they send you down the wrong road.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ The Lord takes his place in court\n    and presents his case against his\
      \ people.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord comes forward to pronounce judgment\n    on the elders and rulers\
      \ of his people:\n“You have ruined Israel, my vineyard.\n    Your houses are\
      \ filled with things stolen from the poor.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ How dare you crush my people,\n    grinding the faces of the poor into\
      \ the dust?”\n    demands the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord says, “Beautiful Zion is haughty:\ncraning her elegant neck,\n\
      \    flirting with her eyes,\nwalking with dainty steps,\n    tinkling her ankle\
      \ bracelets.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ So the Lord will send scabs on her head;\n    the Lord will make beautiful\
      \ Zion bald.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ On that day of judgment\n    the Lord will strip away everything that\
      \ makes her beautiful:\nornaments, headbands, crescent necklaces,\n"
    19: "¹⁹     earrings, bracelets, and veils;\n"
    20: "²⁰ scarves, ankle bracelets, sashes,\n    perfumes, and charms;\n"
    21: "²¹ rings, jewels,\n"
    22: "²²     party clothes, gowns, capes, and purses;\n"
    23: "²³ mirrors, fine linen garments,\n    head ornaments, and shawls. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Instead of smelling of sweet perfume, she will stink.\n    She will wear\
      \ a rope for a sash,\n    and her elegant hair will fall out.\nShe will wear\
      \ rough burlap instead of rich robes.\n    Shame will replace her beauty.\n"
    25: "²⁵ The men of the city will be killed with the sword,\n    and her warriors\
      \ will die in battle.\n"
    26: "²⁶ The gates of Zion will weep and mourn.\n    The city will be like a ravaged\
      \ woman,\n    huddled on the ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ In that day so few men will be left that seven women will fight for each\
      \ man, saying, “Let us all marry you! We will provide our own food and clothing.\
      \ Only let us take your name so we won’t be mocked as old maids.” \n"
    2: "² But in that day, the branch of the Lord\n    will be beautiful and glorious;\n\
      the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory\n    of all who survive in\
      \ Israel.\n"
    3: "³ All who remain in Zion\n    will be a holy people—\nthose who survive the\
      \ destruction of Jerusalem\n    and are recorded among the living.\n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord will wash the filth from beautiful Zion\n    and cleanse Jerusalem\
      \ of its bloodstains\n    with the hot breath of fiery judgment.\n"
    5: "⁵ Then the Lord will provide shade for Mount Zion\n    and all who assemble\
      \ there.\nHe will provide a canopy of cloud during the day\n    and smoke and\
      \ flaming fire at night,\n    covering the glorious land.\n"
    6: "⁶ It will be a shelter from daytime heat\n    and a hiding place from storms\
      \ and rain."
  5:
    1: "¹ Now I will sing for the one I love\n    a song about his vineyard:\nMy beloved\
      \ had a vineyard\n    on a rich and fertile hill.\n"
    2: "² He plowed the land, cleared its stones,\n    and planted it with the best\
      \ vines.\nIn the middle he built a watchtower\n    and carved a winepress in\
      \ the nearby rocks.\nThen he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes,\n    but\
      \ the grapes that grew were bitter. \n"
    3: "³ Now, you people of Jerusalem and Judah,\n    you judge between me and my\
      \ vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What more could I have done for my vineyard\n    that I have not already\
      \ done?\nWhen I expected sweet grapes,\n    why did my vineyard give me bitter\
      \ grapes? \n"
    5: "⁵ Now let me tell you\n    what I will do to my vineyard:\nI will tear down\
      \ its hedges\n    and let it be destroyed.\nI will break down its walls\n  \
      \  and let the animals trample it.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will make it a wild place\n    where the vines are not pruned and the\
      \ ground is not hoed,\n    a place overgrown with briers and thorns.\nI will\
      \ command the clouds\n    to drop no rain on it. \n"
    7: "⁷ The nation of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n \
      \   The people of Judah are his pleasant garden.\nHe expected a crop of justice,\n\
      \    but instead he found oppression.\nHe expected to find righteousness,\n\
      \    but instead he heard cries of violence. \n"
    8: "⁸ What sorrow for you who buy up house after house and field after field,\n\
      \    until everyone is evicted and you live alone in the land.\n"
    9: "⁹ But I have heard the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    swear a solemn oath:\n\
      “Many houses will stand deserted;\n    even beautiful mansions will be empty.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Ten acres of vineyard will not produce even six gallons of wine.\n   \
      \ Ten baskets of seed will yield only one basket of grain.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ What sorrow for those who get up early in the morning\n    looking for\
      \ a drink of alcohol\nand spend long evenings drinking wine\n    to make themselves\
      \ flaming drunk.\n"
    12: "¹² They furnish wine and lovely music at their grand parties—\n    lyre and\
      \ harp, tambourine and flute—\nbut they never think about the Lord\n    or notice\
      \ what he is doing. \n"
    13: "¹³ So my people will go into exile far away\n    because they do not know\
      \ me.\nThose who are great and honored will starve,\n    and the common people\
      \ will die of thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The grave is licking its lips in anticipation,\n    opening its mouth\
      \ wide.\nThe great and the lowly\n    and all the drunken mob will be swallowed\
      \ up.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Humanity will be destroyed, and people brought down;\n    even the arrogant\
      \ will lower their eyes in humiliation.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will be exalted by his justice.\n    The\
      \ holiness of God will be displayed by his righteousness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ In that day lambs will find good pastures,\n    and fattened sheep and\
      \ young goats will feed among the ruins. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ What sorrow for those who drag their sins behind them\n    with ropes\
      \ made of lies,\n    who drag wickedness behind them like a cart!\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They even mock God and say,\n    “Hurry up and do something!\n    We want\
      \ to see what you can do.\nLet the Holy One of Israel carry out his plan,\n\
      \    for we want to know what it is.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ What sorrow for those who say\n    that evil is good and good is evil,\n\
      that dark is light and light is dark,\n    that bitter is sweet and sweet is\
      \ bitter.\n"
    21: "²¹ What sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyes\n    and think themselves\
      \ so clever.\n"
    22: "²² What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wine\n    and boast about\
      \ all the alcohol they can hold.\n"
    23: "²³ They take bribes to let the wicked go free,\n    and they punish the innocent.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, just as fire licks up stubble\n    and dry grass shrivels in\
      \ the flame,\nso their roots will rot\n    and their flowers wither.\nFor they\
      \ have rejected the law of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies;\n    they have despised\
      \ the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ That is why the Lord’s anger burns against his people,\n    and why he\
      \ has raised his fist to crush them.\nThe mountains tremble,\n    and the corpses\
      \ of his people litter the streets like garbage.\nBut even then the Lord’s anger\
      \ is not satisfied.\n    His fist is still poised to strike! \n"
    26: "²⁶ He will send a signal to distant nations far away\n    and whistle to\
      \ those at the ends of the earth.\n    They will come racing toward Jerusalem.\n"
    27: "²⁷ They will not get tired or stumble.\n    They will not stop for rest or\
      \ sleep.\nNot a belt will be loose,\n    not a sandal strap broken.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Their arrows will be sharp\n    and their bows ready for battle.\nSparks\
      \ will fly from their horses’ hooves,\n    and the wheels of their chariots\
      \ will spin like a whirlwind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ They will roar like lions,\n    like the strongest of lions.\nGrowling,\
      \ they will pounce on their victims and carry them off,\n    and no one will\
      \ be there to rescue them.\n"
    30: "³⁰ They will roar over their victims on that day of destruction\n    like\
      \ the roaring of the sea.\nIf someone looks across the land,\n    only darkness\
      \ and distress will be seen;\n    even the light will be darkened by clouds."

    1: '¹ It was in the year King Uzziah died that I saw the Lord. He was sitting
      on a lofty throne, and the train of his robe filled the Temple. '
    2: '² Attending him were mighty seraphim, each having six wings. With two wings
      they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they
      flew. '
    3: "³ They were calling out to each other,\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven’s\
      \ Armies!\n    The whole earth is filled with his glory!” \n"
    4: "⁴ Their voices shook the Temple to its foundations, and the entire building\
      \ was filled with smoke. \n"
    5: "⁵ Then I said, “It’s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have\
      \ filthy lips, and I live among a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the\
      \ King, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from
      the altar with a pair of tongs. '
    7: "⁷ He touched my lips with it and said, “See, this coal has touched your lips.\
      \ Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then I heard the Lord asking, “Whom should I send as a messenger to this\
      \ people? Who will go for us?”\nI said, “Here I am. Send me.” \n"
    9: "⁹ And he said, “Yes, go, and say to this people, \n‘Listen carefully, but\
      \ do not understand.\n    Watch closely, but learn nothing.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Harden the hearts of these people.\n    Plug their ears and shut their\
      \ eyes.\nThat way, they will not see with their eyes,\n    nor hear with their\
      \ ears,\nnor understand with their hearts\n    and turn to me for healing.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “Lord, how long will this go on?”\nAnd he replied,\n“Until\
      \ their towns are empty,\n    their houses are deserted,\n    and the whole\
      \ country is a wasteland;\n"
    12: "¹² until the Lord has sent everyone away,\n    and the entire land of Israel\
      \ lies deserted.\n"
    13: "¹³ If even a tenth—a remnant—survive,\n    it will be invaded again and burned.\n\
      But as a terebinth or oak tree leaves a stump when it is cut down,\n    so Israel’s\
      \ stump will be a holy seed.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ When Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King\
      \ Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, set out to attack\
      \ Jerusalem. However, they were unable to carry out their plan. \n"
    2: "² The news had come to the royal court of Judah: “Syria is allied with Israel\
      \ against us!” So the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear,\
      \ like trees shaking in a storm. \n"
    3: '³ Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Take your son Shear-jashub and go out to
      meet King Ahaz. You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water
      into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed. '
    4: '⁴ Tell him to stop worrying. Tell him he doesn’t need to fear the fierce anger
      of those two burned-out embers, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Yes, the kings of Syria and Israel are plotting against him, saying, '
    6: '⁶ ‘We will attack Judah and capture it for ourselves. Then we will install
      the son of Tabeel as Judah’s king.’ '
    7: "⁷ But this is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n“This invasion will never happen;\n\
      \    it will never take place;\n"
    8: "⁸ for Syria is no stronger than its capital, Damascus,\n    and Damascus is\
      \ no stronger than its king, Rezin.\nAs for Israel, within sixty-five years\n\
      \    it will be crushed and completely destroyed.\n"
    9: "⁹ Israel is no stronger than its capital, Samaria,\n    and Samaria is no\
      \ stronger than its king, Pekah son of Remaliah.\nUnless your faith is firm,\n\
      \    I cannot make you stand firm.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Later, the Lord sent this message to King Ahaz: '
    11: "¹¹ “Ask the Lord your God for a sign of confirmation, Ahaz. Make it as difficult\
      \ as you want—as high as heaven or as deep as the place of the dead.” \n"
    12: "¹² But the king refused. “No,” he said, “I will not test the Lord like that.”\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Isaiah said, “Listen well, you royal family of David! Isn’t it enough
      to exhaust human patience? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well? '
    14: '¹⁴ All right then, the Lord himself will give you the sign. Look! The virgin
      will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel
      (which means ‘God is with us’). '
    15: '¹⁵ By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject
      what is wrong, he will be eating yogurt and honey. '
    16: "¹⁶ For before the child is that old, the lands of the two kings you fear\
      \ so much will both be deserted. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Then the Lord will bring things on you, your nation, and your family\
      \ unlike anything since Israel broke away from Judah. He will bring the king\
      \ of Assyria upon you!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ In that day the Lord will whistle for the army of southern Egypt and for
      the army of Assyria. They will swarm around you like flies and bees. '
    19: '¹⁹ They will come in vast hordes and settle in the fertile areas and also
      in the desolate valleys, caves, and thorny places. '
    20: "²⁰ In that day the Lord will hire a “razor” from beyond the Euphrates River—the\
      \ king of Assyria—and use it to shave off everything: your land, your crops,\
      \ and your people. \n"
    21: '²¹ In that day a farmer will be fortunate to have a cow and two sheep or
      goats left. '
    22: '²² Nevertheless, there will be enough milk for everyone because so few people
      will be left in the land. They will eat their fill of yogurt and honey. '
    23: '²³ In that day the lush vineyards, now worth 1,000 pieces of silver, will
      become patches of briers and thorns. '
    24: '²⁴ The entire land will become a vast expanse of briers and thorns, a hunting
      ground overrun by wildlife. '
    25: ²⁵ No one will go to the fertile hillsides where the gardens once grew, for
      briers and thorns will cover them. Cattle, sheep, and goats will graze there.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Make a large signboard and clearly write this
      name on it: Maher-shalal-hash-baz.” '
    2: "² I asked Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah, both known as\
      \ honest men, to witness my doing this. \n"
    3: '³ Then I slept with my wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
      And the Lord said, “Call him Maher-shalal-hash-baz. '
    4: "⁴ For before this child is old enough to say ‘Papa’ or ‘Mama,’ the king of\
      \ Assyria will carry away both the abundance of Damascus and the riches of Samaria.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord spoke to me again and said, '
    6: '⁶ “My care for the people of Judah is like the gently flowing waters of Shiloah,
      but they have rejected it. They are rejoicing over what will happen to King
      Rezin and King Pekah. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore, the Lord will overwhelm them with a mighty flood from the Euphrates
      River—the king of Assyria and all his glory. This flood will overflow all its
      channels '
    8: "⁸ and sweep into Judah until it is chin deep. It will spread its wings, submerging\
      \ your land from one end to the other, O Immanuel. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Huddle together, you nations, and be terrified.\n    Listen, all you distant\
      \ lands.\nPrepare for battle, but you will be crushed!\n    Yes, prepare for\
      \ battle, but you will be crushed!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Call your councils of war, but they will be worthless.\n    Develop your\
      \ strategies, but they will not succeed.\n    For God is with us!” \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else\
      \ does. He said, \n"
    12: "¹² “Don’t call everything a conspiracy, like they do,\n    and don’t live\
      \ in dread of what frightens them.\n"
    13: "¹³ Make the Lord of Heaven’s Armies holy in your life.\n    He is the one\
      \ you should fear.\nHe is the one who should make you tremble.\n"
    14: "¹⁴     He will keep you safe.\nBut to Israel and Judah\n    he will be a\
      \ stone that makes people stumble,\n    a rock that makes them fall.\nAnd for\
      \ the people of Jerusalem\n    he will be a trap and a snare.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Many will stumble and fall,\n    never to rise again.\n    They will be\
      \ snared and captured.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Preserve the teaching of God;\n    entrust his instructions to those who\
      \ follow me.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I will wait for the Lord,\n    who has turned away from the descendants\
      \ of Jacob.\n    I will put my hope in him. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ I and the children the Lord has given me serve as signs and warnings to\
      \ Israel from the Lord of Heaven’s Armies who dwells in his Temple on Mount\
      \ Zion. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Someone may say to you, “Let’s ask the mediums and those who consult the\
      \ spirits of the dead. With their whisperings and mutterings, they will tell\
      \ us what to do.” But shouldn’t people ask God for guidance? Should the living\
      \ seek guidance from the dead? \n"
    20: '²⁰ Look to God’s instructions and teachings! People who contradict his word
      are completely in the dark. '
    21: '²¹ They will go from one place to another, weary and hungry. And because
      they are hungry, they will rage and curse their king and their God. They will
      look up to heaven '
    22: ²² and down at the earth, but wherever they look, there will be trouble and
      anguish and dark despair. They will be thrown out into the darkness.
  9:
    1: "¹ Nevertheless, that time of darkness and despair will not go on forever.\
      \ The land of Zebulun and Naphtali will be humbled, but there will be a time\
      \ in the future when Galilee of the Gentiles, which lies along the road that\
      \ runs between the Jordan and the sea, will be filled with glory. \n"
    2: "² The people who walk in darkness\n    will see a great light.\nFor those\
      \ who live in a land of deep darkness,\n    a light will shine.\n"
    3: "³ You will enlarge the nation of Israel,\n    and its people will rejoice.\n\
      They will rejoice before you\n    as people rejoice at the harvest\n    and\
      \ like warriors dividing the plunder.\n"
    4: "⁴ For you will break the yoke of their slavery\n    and lift the heavy burden\
      \ from their shoulders.\nYou will break the oppressor’s rod,\n    just as you\
      \ did when you destroyed the army of Midian.\n"
    5: "⁵ The boots of the warrior\n    and the uniforms bloodstained by war\nwill\
      \ all be burned.\n    They will be fuel for the fire. \n"
    6: "⁶ For a child is born to us,\n    a son is given to us.\nThe government will\
      \ rest on his shoulders.\n    And he will be called:\nWonderful Counselor, Mighty\
      \ God,\n    Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n"
    7: "⁷ His government and its peace\n    will never end.\nHe will rule with fairness\
      \ and justice from the throne of his ancestor David\n    for all eternity.\n\
      The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    will make this\
      \ happen! \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord has spoken out against Jacob;\n    his judgment has fallen upon\
      \ Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ And the people of Israel and Samaria,\n    who spoke with such pride and\
      \ arrogance,\n    will soon know it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They said, “We will replace the broken bricks of our ruins with finished\
      \ stone,\n    and replant the felled sycamore-fig trees with cedars.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the Lord will bring Rezin’s enemies against Israel\n    and stir up\
      \ all their foes.\n"
    12: "¹² The Syrians from the east and the Philistines from the west\n    will\
      \ bare their fangs and devour Israel.\nBut even then the Lord’s anger will not\
      \ be satisfied.\n    His fist is still poised to strike. \n"
    13: "¹³ For after all this punishment, the people will still not repent.\n   \
      \ They will not seek the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore, in a single day the Lord will destroy both the head and the\
      \ tail,\n    the noble palm branch and the lowly reed.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The leaders of Israel are the head,\n    and the lying prophets are the\
      \ tail.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For the leaders of the people have misled them.\n    They have led them\
      \ down the path of destruction.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ That is why the Lord takes no pleasure in the young men\n    and shows\
      \ no mercy even to the widows and orphans.\nFor they are all wicked hypocrites,\n\
      \    and they all speak foolishness.\nBut even then the Lord’s anger will not\
      \ be satisfied.\n    His fist is still poised to strike. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ This wickedness is like a brushfire.\n    It burns not only briers and\
      \ thorns\nbut also sets the forests ablaze.\n    Its burning sends up clouds\
      \ of smoke.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The land will be blackened\n    by the fury of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.\n\
      The people will be fuel for the fire,\n    and no one will spare even his own\
      \ brother.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They will attack their neighbor on the right\n    but will still be hungry.\n\
      They will devour their neighbor on the left\n    but will not be satisfied.\n\
      In the end they will even eat their own children.\n"
    21: "²¹ Manasseh will feed on Ephraim,\n    Ephraim will feed on Manasseh,\n \
      \   and both will devour Judah.\nBut even then the Lord’s anger will not be\
      \ satisfied.\n    His fist is still poised to strike."
  10:
    1: "¹ What sorrow awaits the unjust judges\n    and those who issue unfair laws.\n"
    2: "² They deprive the poor of justice\n    and deny the rights of the needy among\
      \ my people.\nThey prey on widows\n    and take advantage of orphans.\n"
    3: "³ What will you do when I punish you,\n    when I send disaster upon you from\
      \ a distant land?\nTo whom will you turn for help?\n    Where will your treasures\
      \ be safe?\n"
    4: "⁴ You will stumble along as prisoners\n    or lie among the dead.\nBut even\
      \ then the Lord’s anger will not be satisfied.\n    His fist is still poised\
      \ to strike. \n"
    5: "⁵ “What sorrow awaits Assyria, the rod of my anger.\n    I use it as a club\
      \ to express my anger.\n"
    6: "⁶ I am sending Assyria against a godless nation,\n    against a people with\
      \ whom I am angry.\nAssyria will plunder them,\n    trampling them like dirt\
      \ beneath its feet.\n"
    7: "⁷ But the king of Assyria will not understand that he is my tool;\n    his\
      \ mind does not work that way.\nHis plan is simply to destroy,\n    to cut down\
      \ nation after nation.\n"
    8: "⁸ He will say,\n    ‘Each of my princes will soon be a king.\n"
    9: "⁹ We destroyed Calno just as we did Carchemish.\n    Hamath fell before us\
      \ as Arpad did.\n    And we destroyed Samaria just as we did Damascus.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yes, we have finished off many a kingdom\n    whose gods were greater\
      \ than those in Jerusalem and Samaria.\n"
    11: "¹¹ So we will defeat Jerusalem and her gods,\n    just as we destroyed Samaria\
      \ with hers.’” \n"
    12: '¹² After the Lord has used the king of Assyria to accomplish his purposes
      on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he will turn against the king of Assyria and
      punish him—for he is proud and arrogant. '
    13: "¹³ He boasts, \n“By my own powerful arm I have done this.\n    With my own\
      \ shrewd wisdom I planned it.\nI have broken down the defenses of nations\n\
      \    and carried off their treasures.\n    I have knocked down their kings like\
      \ a bull.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have robbed their nests of riches\n    and gathered up kingdoms as a\
      \ farmer gathers eggs.\nNo one can even flap a wing against me\n    or utter\
      \ a peep of protest.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But can the ax boast greater power than the person who uses it?\n    Is\
      \ the saw greater than the person who saws?\nCan a rod strike unless a hand\
      \ moves it?\n    Can a wooden cane walk by itself?\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    will send a plague\
      \ among Assyria’s proud troops,\n    and a flaming fire will consume its glory.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord, the Light of Israel, will be a fire;\n    the Holy One will\
      \ be a flame.\nHe will devour the thorns and briers with fire,\n    burning\
      \ up the enemy in a single night.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord will consume Assyria’s glory\n    like a fire consumes a forest\
      \ in a fruitful land;\n    it will waste away like sick people in a plague.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Of all that glorious forest, only a few trees will survive—\n    so few\
      \ that a child could count them! \n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day the remnant left in Israel,\n    the survivors in the house\
      \ of Jacob,\nwill no longer depend on allies\n    who seek to destroy them.\n\
      But they will faithfully trust the Lord,\n    the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    21: "²¹ A remnant will return;\n    yes, the remnant of Jacob will return to the\
      \ Mighty God.\n"
    22: "²² But though the people of Israel are as numerous\n    as the sand of the\
      \ seashore,\nonly a remnant of them will return.\n    The Lord has rightly decided\
      \ to destroy his people.\n"
    23: "²³ Yes, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    has already decided to\
      \ destroy the entire land. \n"
    24: '²⁴ So this is what the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, says: “O my people
      in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians when they oppress you with rod and
      club as the Egyptians did long ago. '
    25: '²⁵ In a little while my anger against you will end, and then my anger will
      rise up to destroy them.” '
    26: "²⁶ The Lord of Heaven’s Armies will lash them with his whip, as he did when\
      \ Gideon triumphed over the Midianites at the rock of Oreb, or when the Lord’s\
      \ staff was raised to drown the Egyptian army in the sea. \n"
    27: "²⁷ In that day the Lord will end the bondage of his people.\n    He will\
      \ break the yoke of slavery\n    and lift it from their shoulders. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Look, the Assyrians are now at Aiath.\n    They are passing through Migron\n\
      \    and are storing their equipment at Micmash.\n"
    29: "²⁹ They are crossing the pass\n    and are camping at Geba.\nFear strikes\
      \ the town of Ramah.\n    All the people of Gibeah, the hometown of Saul,\n\
      \    are running for their lives.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Scream in terror,\n    you people of Gallim!\nShout out a warning to Laishah.\n\
      \    Oh, poor Anathoth!\n"
    31: "³¹ There go the people of Madmenah, all fleeing.\n    The citizens of Gebim\
      \ are trying to hide.\n"
    32: "³² The enemy stops at Nob for the rest of that day.\n    He shakes his fist\
      \ at beautiful Mount Zion, the mountain of Jerusalem. \n"
    33: "³³ But look! The Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    will chop down the\
      \ mighty tree of Assyria with great power!\nHe will cut down the proud.\n  \
      \  That lofty tree will be brought down.\n"
    34: "³⁴ He will cut down the forest trees with an ax.\n    Lebanon will fall to\
      \ the Mighty One."
  11:
    1: "¹ Out of the stump of David’s family will grow a shoot—\n    yes, a new Branch\
      \ bearing fruit from the old root.\n"
    2: "² And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—\n    the Spirit of wisdom and\
      \ understanding,\nthe Spirit of counsel and might,\n    the Spirit of knowledge\
      \ and the fear of the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ He will delight in obeying the Lord.\n    He will not judge by appearance\n\
      \    nor make a decision based on hearsay.\n"
    4: "⁴ He will give justice to the poor\n    and make fair decisions for the exploited.\n\
      The earth will shake at the force of his word,\n    and one breath from his\

    6: "⁶ In that day the wolf and the lamb will live together;\n    the leopard will\
      \ lie down with the baby goat.\nThe calf and the yearling will be safe with\

    7: "⁷ The cow will graze near the bear.\n    The cub and the calf will lie down\

    8: "⁸ The baby will play safely near the hole of a cobra.\n    Yes, a little child\
      \ will put its hand in a nest of deadly snakes without harm.\n"
    9: "⁹ Nothing will hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,\n    for as the waters\
      \ fill the sea,\n    so the earth will be filled with people who know the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ In that day the heir to David’s throne\n    will be a banner of salvation\
      \ to all the world.\nThe nations will rally to him,\n    and the land where\
      \ he lives will be a glorious place.\n"
    11: "¹¹ In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time\n    to bring\
      \ back the remnant of his people—\nthose who remain in Assyria and northern\
      \ Egypt;\n    in southern Egypt, Ethiopia, and Elam;\n    in Babylonia, Hamath,\

    12: "¹² He will raise a flag among the nations\n    and assemble the exiles of\
      \ Israel.\nHe will gather the scattered people of Judah\n    from the ends of\

    13: "¹³ Then at last the jealousy between Israel and Judah will end.\n    They\
      \ will not be rivals anymore.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They will join forces to swoop down on Philistia to the west.\n    Together\
      \ they will attack and plunder the nations to the east.\nThey will occupy the\
      \ lands of Edom and Moab,\n    and Ammon will obey them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord will make a dry path through the gulf of the Red Sea.\n    He\
      \ will wave his hand over the Euphrates River,\nsending a mighty wind to divide\
      \ it into seven streams\n    so it can easily be crossed on foot.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He will make a highway for the remnant of his people,\n    the remnant\

  12:

    10: "¹⁰ Why? Because you have turned from the God who can save you.\n    You have\

      I will make an end\n    to all the groaning Babylon caused.\n"
    3: "³ My stomach aches and burns with pain.\n    Sharp pangs of anguish are upon\

    5: "⁵ Look! They are preparing a great feast.\n    They are spreading rugs for\
      \ people to sit on.\n    Everyone is eating and drinking.\nBut quick! Grab your\
      \ shields and prepare for battle.\n    You are being attacked! \n"
    6: "⁶ Meanwhile, the Lord said to me,\n“Put a watchman on the city wall.\n   \
      \ Let him shout out what he sees.\n"
    7: "⁷ He should look for chariots\n    drawn by pairs of horses,\nand for riders\
      \ on donkeys and camels.\n    Let the watchman be fully alert.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then the watchman called out,\n“Day after day I have stood on the watchtower,\
      \ my lord.\n    Night after night I have remained at my post.\n"
    9: "⁹ Now at last—look!\nHere comes a man in a chariot\n    with a pair of horses!”\n\
      Then the watchman said,\n    “Babylon is fallen, fallen!\nAll the idols of Babylon\n\
      \    lie broken on the ground!”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ O my people, threshed and winnowed,\n    I have told you everything the\

    12: "¹² The watchman replies,\n“Morning is coming, but night will soon return.\n\

  22:
    1: "¹ This message came to me concerning Jerusalem—the Valley of Vision:\nWhat\

    2: "² The whole city is in a terrible uproar.\n    What do I see in this reveling\

    3: "³ All your leaders have fled.\n    They surrendered without resistance.\n\
      The people tried to slip away,\n    but they were captured, too.\n"
    4: "⁴ That’s why I said, “Leave me alone to weep;\n    do not try to comfort me.\n\
      Let me cry for my people\n    as I watch them being destroyed.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Oh, what a day of crushing defeat!\n    What a day of confusion and terror\n\

    10: "¹⁰ You survey the houses and tear some down\n    for stone to strengthen\
      \ the walls.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Between the city walls, you build a reservoir\n    for water from the\
      \ old pool.\nBut you never ask for help from the One who did all this.\n   \
      \ You never considered the One who planned this long ago. \n"
    12: "¹² At that time the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    called you to\
      \ weep and mourn.\nHe told you to shave your heads in sorrow for your sins\n\

    13: "¹³ But instead, you dance and play;\n    you slaughter cattle and kill sheep.\n\

      \   for tomorrow we die!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord of Heaven’s Armies has revealed this to me: “Till the day you\
      \ die, you will never be forgiven for this sin.” That is the judgment of the\

    15: "¹⁵ This is what the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, said to me: “Confront\

    19: '¹⁹ “Yes, I will drive you out of office,” says the Lord. “I will pull you

    20: '²⁰ And then I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah to replace you. '
    21: '²¹ I will dress him in your royal robes and will give him your title and
      your authority. And he will be a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah. '
    22: '²² I will give him the key to the house of David—the highest position in

      he closes doors, no one will be able to open them. '
    23: '²³ He will bring honor to his family name, for I will drive him firmly in

    2: "² Mourn in silence, you people of the coast\n    and you merchants of Sidon.\n\

    11: "¹¹ The Lord held out his hand over the sea\n    and shook the kingdoms of\

    12: "¹² He says, “Never again will you rejoice,\n    O daughter of Sidon, for\

      \ rest.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Look at the land of Babylonia—\n    the people of that land are gone!\n\
      The Assyrians have handed Babylon over\n    to the wild animals of the desert.\n\
      They have built siege ramps against its walls,\n    torn down its palaces,\n\
      \    and turned it to a heap of rubble. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wail, you ships of Tarshish,\n    for your harbor is destroyed! \n"

    3: "³ The proud city of Samaria—\n    the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel—\n\

    4: "⁴ It sits at the head of a fertile valley,\n    but its glorious beauty will\
      \ fade like a flower.\nWhoever sees it will snatch it up,\n    as an early fig\

    5: "⁵ Then at last the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    will himself be Israel’s glorious\
      \ crown.\nHe will be the pride and joy\n    of the remnant of his people.\n"
    6: "⁶ He will give a longing for justice\n    to their judges.\nHe will give great\

    7: "⁷ Now, however, Israel is led by drunks\n    who reel with wine and stagger\
      \ with alcohol.\nThe priests and prophets stagger with alcohol\n    and lose\

    11: "¹¹ So now God will have to speak to his people\n    through foreign oppressors\

    12: "¹² God has told his people,\n“Here is a place of rest;\n    let the weary\

    14: "¹⁴ Therefore, listen to this message from the Lord,\n    you scoffing rulers\
      \ in Jerusalem.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You boast, “We have struck a bargain to cheat death\n    and have made\
      \ a deal to dodge the grave.\nThe coming destruction can never touch us,\n \

    17: "¹⁷ I will test you with the measuring line of justice\n    and the plumb\

    18: "¹⁸ I will cancel the bargain you made to cheat death,\n    and I will overturn\

    19: "¹⁹ Again and again that flood will come,\n    morning after morning,\nday\

    24: "²⁴ Does a farmer always plow and never sow?\n    Is he forever cultivating\

    25: "²⁵ Does he not finally plant his seeds—\n    black cumin, cumin, wheat, barley,\
      \ and emmer wheat—\neach in its proper way,\n    and each in its proper place?\n"
    26: "²⁶ The farmer knows just what to do,\n    for God has given him understanding.\n"
    27: "²⁷ A heavy sledge is never used to thresh black cumin;\n    rather, it is\
      \ beaten with a light stick.\nA threshing wheel is never rolled on cumin;\n\
      \    instead, it is beaten lightly with a flail.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Grain for bread is easily crushed,\n    so he doesn’t keep on pounding\

    3: "³ I will be your enemy,\n    surrounding Jerusalem and attacking its walls.\n\

    3: "³ But by trusting Pharaoh, you will be humiliated,\n    and by depending on\

    19: "¹⁹ You will no longer see these fierce, violent people\n    with their strange,\

    20: "²⁰ Instead, you will see Zion as a place of holy festivals.\n    You will\
      \ see Jerusalem, a city quiet and secure.\nIt will be like a tent whose ropes\

    8: "⁸ For it is the day of the Lord’s revenge,\n    the year when Edom will be\

    14: "¹⁴ Desert animals will mingle there with hyenas,\n    their howls filling\

  35:
    1: "¹ Even the wilderness and desert will be glad in those days.\n    The wasteland\

    2: "² Yes, there will be an abundance of flowers\n    and singing and joy!\nThe\

    3: "³ With this news, strengthen those who have tired hands,\n    and encourage\

  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, King Sennacherib of Assyria
      came to attack the fortified towns of Judah and conquered them. '
    2: "² Then the king of Assyria sent his chief of staff from Lachish with a huge\
      \ army to confront King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The Assyrians took up a position\
      \ beside the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading\
      \ to the field where cloth is washed. \n"
    3: "³ These are the officials who went out to meet with them: Eliakim son of Hilkiah,\
      \ the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph,\
      \ the royal historian. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the Assyrian king’s chief of staff told them to give this message to\
      \ Hezekiah:\n“This is what the great king of Assyria says: What are you trusting\
      \ in that makes you so confident? "
    5: '⁵ Do you think that mere words can substitute for military skill and strength?
      Who are you counting on, that you have rebelled against me? '
    6: "⁶ On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath\
      \ your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely\
      \ unreliable! \n"
    7: "⁷ “But perhaps you will say to me, ‘We are trusting in the Lord our God!’\
      \ But isn’t he the one who was insulted by Hezekiah? Didn’t Hezekiah tear down\
      \ his shrines and altars and make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem worship only\
      \ at the altar here in Jerusalem? \n"
    8: '⁸ “I’ll tell you what! Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria.
      I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them! '
    9: '⁹ With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent
      of my master’s troops, even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and charioteers? '
    10: "¹⁰ What’s more, do you think we have invaded your land without the Lord’s\
      \ direction? The Lord himself told us, ‘Attack this land and destroy it!’” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, “Please\
      \ speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don’t speak in Hebrew,\
      \ for the people on the wall will hear.” \n"
    12: "¹² But Sennacherib’s chief of staff replied, “Do you think my master sent\
      \ this message only to you and your master? He wants all the people to hear\
      \ it, for when we put this city under siege, they will suffer along with you.\
      \ They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink\
      \ their own urine.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the
      wall, “Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria! '
    14: '¹⁴ This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never
      be able to rescue you. '
    15: "¹⁵ Don’t let him fool you into trusting in the Lord by saying, ‘The Lord\
      \ will surely rescue us. This city will never fall into the hands of the Assyrian\
      \ king!’ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Don’t listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is
      offering: Make peace with me—open the gates and come out. Then each of you can
      continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your
      own well. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one—a land of\
      \ grain and new wine, bread and vineyards. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, ‘The Lord will rescue us!’
      Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of
      Assyria? '
    19: '¹⁹ What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods
      of Sepharvaim? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power? '
    20: "²⁰ What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power?\
      \ So what makes you think that the Lord can rescue Jerusalem from me?” \n"
    21: "²¹ But the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had\
      \ commanded them, “Do not answer him.” \n"
    22: ²² Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court
      secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went back to Hezekiah.
      They tore their clothes in despair, and they went in to see the king and told
      him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said.
  37:
    1: '¹ When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes and put on burlap
      and went into the Temple of the Lord. '
    2: '² And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the court secretary,
      and the leading priests, all dressed in burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of
      Amoz. '
    3: '³ They told him, “This is what King Hezekiah says: Today is a day of trouble,
      insults, and disgrace. It is like when a child is ready to be born, but the
      mother has no strength to deliver the baby. '
    4: "⁴ But perhaps the Lord your God has heard the Assyrian chief of staff, sent\
      \ by the king to defy the living God, and will punish him for his words. Oh,\
      \ pray for those of us who are left!” \n"
    5: '⁵ After King Hezekiah’s officials delivered the king’s message to Isaiah, '
    6: '⁶ the prophet replied, “Say to your master, ‘This is what the Lord says: Do
      not be disturbed by this blasphemous speech against me from the Assyrian king’s
      messengers. '
    7: "⁷ Listen! I myself will move against him, and the king will receive a message\
      \ that he is needed at home. So he will return to his land, where I will have\
      \ him killed with a sword.’” \n"
    8: "⁸ Meanwhile, the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult\
      \ the king of Assyria, who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah. \n"
    9: "⁹ Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia\
      \ was leading an army to fight against him. Before leaving to meet the attack,\
      \ he sent messengers back to Hezekiah in Jerusalem with this message: \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don’t let your God, in whom
      you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by
      the king of Assyria. '
    11: '¹¹ You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they
      have gone. They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way! Why
      should you be any different? '
    12: '¹² Have the gods of other nations rescued them—such nations as Gozan, Haran,
      Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? My predecessors destroyed
      them all! '
    13: "¹³ What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad? What happened\
      \ to the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he
      went up to the Lord’s Temple and spread it out before the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the Lord: '
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the
      mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone
      created the heavens and the earth. '
    17: "¹⁷ Bend down, O Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, O Lord, and see! Listen\
      \ to Sennacherib’s words of defiance against the living God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these
      nations. '
    19: '¹⁹ And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned
      them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at
      all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. '
    20: "²⁰ Now, O Lord our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of\
      \ the earth will know that you alone, O Lord, are God.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the
      Lord, the God of Israel, says: Because you prayed about King Sennacherib of
      Assyria, '
    22: "²² the Lord has spoken this word against him:\n“The virgin daughter of Zion\n\
      \    despises you and laughs at you.\nThe daughter of Jerusalem\n    shakes\
      \ her head in derision as you flee. \n"
    23: "²³ “Whom have you been defying and ridiculing?\n    Against whom did you\
      \ raise your voice?\nAt whom did you look with such haughty eyes?\n    It was\
      \ the Holy One of Israel!\n"
    24: "²⁴ By your messengers you have defied the Lord.\n    You have said, ‘With\
      \ my many chariots\nI have conquered the highest mountains—\n    yes, the remotest\
      \ peaks of Lebanon.\nI have cut down its tallest cedars\n    and its finest\
      \ cypress trees.\nI have reached its farthest heights\n    and explored its\
      \ deepest forests.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I have dug wells in many foreign lands\n    and refreshed myself with\
      \ their water.\nWith the sole of my foot,\n    I stopped up all the rivers of\
      \ Egypt!’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “But have you not heard?\n    I decided this long ago.\nLong ago I planned\
      \ it,\n    and now I am making it happen.\nI planned for you to crush fortified\
      \ cities\n    into heaps of rubble.\n"
    27: "²⁷ That is why their people have so little power\n    and are so frightened\
      \ and confused.\nThey are as weak as grass,\n    as easily trampled as tender\
      \ green shoots.\nThey are like grass sprouting on a housetop,\n    scorched\
      \ before it can grow lush and tall. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “But I know you well—\n    where you stay\nand when you come and go.\n\
      \    I know the way you have raged against me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ And because of your raging against me\n    and your arrogance, which I\
      \ have heard for myself,\nI will put my hook in your nose\n    and my bit in\
      \ your mouth.\nI will make you return\n    by the same road on which you came.”\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Here is the proof that what I say is true:\n\
      “This year you will eat only what grows up by itself,\n    and next year you\
      \ will eat what springs up from that.\nBut in the third year you will plant\
      \ crops and harvest them;\n    you will tend vineyards and eat their fruit.\n"
    31: "³¹ And you who are left in Judah,\n    who have escaped the ravages of the\
      \ siege,\nwill put roots down in your own soil\n    and grow up and flourish.\n"
    32: "³² For a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem,\n    a group\
      \ of survivors from Mount Zion.\nThe passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven’s\
      \ Armies\n    will make this happen! \n"
    33: "³³ “And this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria:\n“‘His armies\

    34: "³⁴ The king will return to his own country\n    by the same road on which\

    35: "³⁵ ‘For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David,\n    I will defend\

    36: '³⁶ That night the angel of the Lord went out to the Assyrian camp and killed
      185,000 Assyrian soldiers. When the surviving Assyrians woke up the next morning,
      they found corpses everywhere. '
    37: "³⁷ Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land.\
      \ He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there. \n"
    38: ³⁸ One day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons
      Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords. They then escaped to
      the land of Ararat, and another son, Esarhaddon, became the next king of Assyria.
  38:
    1: "¹ About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill, and the prophet Isaiah son\
      \ of Amoz went to visit him. He gave the king this message: “This is what the\
      \ Lord says: ‘Set your affairs in order, for you are going to die. You will\
      \ not recover from this illness.’” \n"
    2: '² When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the
      Lord, '
    3: "³ “Remember, O Lord, how I have always been faithful to you and have served\
      \ you single-mindedly, always doing what pleases you.” Then he broke down and\
      \ wept bitterly. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then this message came to Isaiah from the Lord: '
    5: '⁵ “Go back to Hezekiah and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your
      ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will add
      fifteen years to your life, '
    6: "⁶ and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. Yes, I will\
      \ defend this city. \n"
    7: '⁷ “‘And this is the sign from the Lord to prove that he will do as he promised: '
    8: "⁸ I will cause the sun’s shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial\
      \ of Ahaz!’” So the shadow on the sundial moved backward ten steps. \n"
    9: "⁹ When King Hezekiah was well again, he wrote this poem: \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I said, “In the prime of my life,\n    must I now enter the place of the\
      \ dead?\n    Am I to be robbed of the rest of my years?”\n"
    11: "¹¹ I said, “Never again will I see the Lord God\n    while still in the land\

      \ live in this world.\n"
    12: "¹² My life has been blown away\n    like a shepherd’s tent in a storm.\n\
      It has been cut short,\n    as when a weaver cuts cloth from a loom.\n    Suddenly,\
      \ my life was over.\n"
    13: "¹³ I waited patiently all night,\n    but I was torn apart as though by lions.\n\
      \    Suddenly, my life was over.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Delirious, I chattered like a swallow or a crane,\n    and then I moaned\
      \ like a mourning dove.\nMy eyes grew tired of looking to heaven for help.\n\
      \    I am in trouble, Lord. Help me!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ But what could I say?\n    For he himself sent this sickness.\nNow I will\
      \ walk humbly throughout my years\n    because of this anguish I have felt.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Lord, your discipline is good,\n    for it leads to life and health.\n\

    18: "¹⁸ For the dead cannot praise you;\n    they cannot raise their voices in\
      \ praise.\nThose who go down to the grave\n    can no longer hope in your faithfulness.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Only the living can praise you as I do today.\n    Each generation tells\
      \ of your faithfulness to the next.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Think of it—the Lord is ready to heal me!\n    I will sing his praises\
      \ with instruments\nevery day of my life\n    in the Temple of the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ Isaiah had said to Hezekiah’s servants, “Make an ointment from figs and\
      \ spread it over the boil, and Hezekiah will recover.” \n"
    22: ²² And Hezekiah had asked, “What sign will prove that I will go to the Temple
      of the Lord?”
  39:
    1: '¹ Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
      Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been very
      sick and that he had recovered. '
    2: "² Hezekiah was delighted with the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything\
      \ in his treasure-houses—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic\
      \ oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his\
      \ royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah\
      \ did not show them. \n"
    3: "³ Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did those\
      \ men want? Where were they from?”\nHezekiah replied, “They came from the distant\
      \ land of Babylon.” \n"
    4: "⁴ “What did they see in your palace?” asked Isaiah.\n“They saw everything,”\
      \ Hezekiah replied. “I showed them everything I own—all my royal treasuries.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to this message from the Lord of Heaven’s
      Armies: '
    6: '⁶ ‘The time is coming when everything in your palace—all the treasures stored
      up by your ancestors until now—will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will
      be left,’ says the Lord. '
    7: "⁷ ‘Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become\
      \ eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon’s king.’” \n"
    8: ⁸ Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “This message you have given me from the Lord
      is good.” For the king was thinking, “At least there will be peace and security
      during my lifetime.”
  40:
    1: "¹ “Comfort, comfort my people,”\n    says your God.\n"
    2: "² “Speak tenderly to Jerusalem.\nTell her that her sad days are gone\n   \
      \ and her sins are pardoned.\nYes, the Lord has punished her twice over\n  \

    3: "³ Listen! It’s the voice of someone shouting,\n“Clear the way through the\

      \    for our God!\n"
    4: "⁴ Fill in the valleys,\n    and level the mountains and hills.\nStraighten\

    5: "⁵ Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed,\n    and all people will see\

    6: "⁶ A voice said, “Shout!”\n    I asked, “What should I shout?”\n“Shout that\

      \ flowers in a field.\n"
    7: "⁷ The grass withers and the flowers fade\n    beneath the breath of the Lord.\n\
      \    And so it is with people.\n"
    8: "⁸ The grass withers and the flowers fade,\n    but the word of our God stands\

    9: "⁹ O Zion, messenger of good news,\n    shout from the mountaintops!\nShout\

    10: "¹⁰ Yes, the Sovereign Lord is coming in power.\n    He will rule with a powerful\
      \ arm.\n    See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He will feed his flock like a shepherd.\n    He will carry the lambs in\

    13: "¹³ Who is able to advise the Spirit of the Lord?\n    Who knows enough to\

    14: "¹⁴ Has the Lord ever needed anyone’s advice?\n    Does he need instruction\

      \ the path of justice? \n"
    15: "¹⁵ No, for all the nations of the world\n    are but a drop in the bucket.\n\
      They are nothing more\n    than dust on the scales.\nHe picks up the whole earth\n\
      \    as though it were a grain of sand.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ All the wood in Lebanon’s forests\n    and all Lebanon’s animals would\

    17: "¹⁷ The nations of the world are worth nothing to him.\n    In his eyes they\

    18: "¹⁸ To whom can you compare God?\n    What image can you find to resemble\
      \ him?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Can he be compared to an idol formed in a mold,\n    overlaid with gold,\
      \ and decorated with silver chains?\n"
    20: "²⁰ Or if people are too poor for that,\n    they might at least choose wood\
      \ that won’t decay\nand a skilled craftsman\n    to carve an image that won’t\
      \ fall down! \n"
    21: "²¹ Haven’t you heard? Don’t you understand?\n    Are you deaf to the words\
      \ of God—\nthe words he gave before the world began?\n    Are you so ignorant?\n"
    22: "²² God sits above the circle of the earth.\n    The people below seem like\
      \ grasshoppers to him!\nHe spreads out the heavens like a curtain\n    and makes\
      \ his tent from them.\n"
    23: "²³ He judges the great people of the world\n    and brings them all to nothing.\n"
    24: "²⁴ They hardly get started, barely taking root,\n    when he blows on them\

    27: "²⁷ O Jacob, how can you say the Lord does not see your troubles?\n    O Israel,\

    28: "²⁸ Have you never heard?\n    Have you never understood?\nThe Lord is the\

    29: "²⁹ He gives power to the weak\n    and strength to the powerless.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Even youths will become weak and tired,\n    and young men will fall in\

  44:
    1: "¹ “But now, listen to me, Jacob my servant,\n    Israel my chosen one.\n"
    2: "² The Lord who made you and helps you says:\nDo not be afraid, O Jacob, my\

    3: "³ For I will pour out water to quench your thirst\n    and to irrigate your\

      \ my blessing on your children.\n"
    4: "⁴ They will thrive like watered grass,\n    like willows on a riverbank.\n"
    5: "⁵ Some will proudly claim, ‘I belong to the Lord.’\n    Others will say, ‘I\

    6: "⁶ This is what the Lord says—Israel’s King and Redeemer, the Lord of Heaven’s\

    7: "⁷ Who is like me?\n    Let him step forward and prove to you his power.\n\
      Let him do as I have done since ancient times\n    when I established a people\

    8: "⁸ Do not tremble; do not be afraid.\n    Did I not proclaim my purposes for\
      \ you long ago?\nYou are my witnesses—is there any other God?\n    No! There\
      \ is no other Rock—not one!” \n"
    9: "⁹ How foolish are those who manufacture idols.\n    These prized objects are\
      \ really worthless.\nThe people who worship idols don’t know this,\n    so they\
      \ are all put to shame.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who but a fool would make his own god—\n    an idol that cannot help him\

    12: "¹² The blacksmith stands at his forge to make a sharp tool,\n    pounding\

      \    It makes him thirsty and faint.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then the wood-carver measures a block of wood\n    and draws a pattern\

      He gives it human beauty\n    and puts it in a little shrine.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He cuts down cedars;\n    he selects the cypress and the oak;\nhe plants\

    15: "¹⁵ Then he uses part of the wood to make a fire.\n    With it he warms himself\

      \ makes himself a god to worship!\nHe makes an idol\n    and bows down in front\
      \ of it!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He burns part of the tree to roast his meat\n    and to keep himself warm.\n\
      \    He says, “Ah, that fire feels good.”\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then he takes what’s left\n    and makes his god: a carved idol!\nHe falls\

      \    “You are my god!” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Such stupidity and ignorance!\n    Their eyes are closed, and they cannot\

    19: "¹⁹ The person who made the idol never stops to reflect,\n    “Why, it’s just\
      \ a block of wood!\nI burned half of it for heat\n    and used it to bake my\
      \ bread and roast my meat.\nHow can the rest of it be a god?\n    Should I bow\

    20: "²⁰ The poor, deluded fool feeds on ashes.\n    He trusts something that can’t\

    21: "²¹ “Pay attention, O Jacob,\n    for you are my servant, O Israel.\nI, the\

    22: "²² I have swept away your sins like a cloud.\n    I have scattered your offenses\

    23: "²³ Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done this wondrous thing.\n    Shout\
      \ for joy, O depths of the earth!\nBreak into song,\n    O mountains and forests\

      \ with me\n    when I made the earth?\n"
    25: "²⁵ I expose the false prophets as liars\n    and make fools of fortune-tellers.\n\
      I cause the wise to give bad advice,\n    thus proving them to be fools.\n"
    26: "²⁶ But I carry out the predictions of my prophets!\n    By them I say to\

    27: "²⁷ When I speak to the rivers and say, ‘Dry up!’\n    they will be dry.\n"
    28: "²⁸ When I say of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,’\n    he will certainly do as\
      \ I say.\nHe will command, ‘Rebuild Jerusalem’;\n    he will say, ‘Restore the\
      \ Temple.’”"
  45:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, his anointed one,\n    whose right\

      \    Their fortress gates will be opened,\n    never to shut again.\n"
    2: "² This is what the Lord says:\n“I will go before you, Cyrus,\n    and level\

      \ of iron.\n"
    3: "³ And I will give you treasures hidden in the darkness—\n    secret riches.\n\
      I will do this so you may know that I am the Lord,\n    the God of Israel, the\

    4: "⁴ “And why have I called you for this work?\n    Why did I call you by name\

    5: "⁵ I am the Lord;\n    there is no other God.\nI have equipped you for battle,\n\

      \  I, the Lord, created them. \n"
    9: "⁹ “What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.\n    Does a clay\
      \ pot argue with its maker?\nDoes the clay dispute with the one who shapes it,\
      \ saying,\n    ‘Stop, you’re doing it wrong!’\nDoes the pot exclaim,\n    ‘How\

    10: "¹⁰ How terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father,\n    ‘Why\
      \ was I born?’\nor if it said to its mother,\n    ‘Why did you make me this\

    19: "¹⁹ I publicly proclaim bold promises.\n    I do not whisper obscurities in\

    21: "²¹ Consult together, argue your case.\n    Get together and decide what to\

  46:

    2: "² Both the idols and their owners are bowed down.\n    The gods cannot protect\

    3: "³ “Listen to me, descendants of Jacob,\n    all you who remain in Israel.\n\

    17: "¹⁷ He put on righteousness as his body armor\n    and placed the helmet of\

      \ I, the Lord, who has the power to save!” \n"
    2: "² Why are your clothes so red,\n    as if you have been treading out grapes?\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “I have been treading the winepress alone;\n    no one was there to help\
      \ me.\nIn my anger I have trampled my enemies\n    as if they were grapes.\n\
      In my fury I have trampled my foes.\n    Their blood has stained my clothes.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the time has come for me to avenge my people,\n    to ransom them from\
      \ their oppressors.\n"
    5: "⁵ I was amazed to see that no one intervened\n    to help the oppressed.\n\
      So I myself stepped in to save them with my strong arm,\n    and my wrath sustained\
      \ me.\n"
    6: "⁶ I crushed the nations in my anger\n    and made them stagger and fall to\
      \ the ground,\n    spilling their blood upon the earth.” \n"
    7: "⁷ I will tell of the Lord’s unfailing love.\n    I will praise the Lord for\
      \ all he has done.\nI will rejoice in his great goodness to Israel,\n    which\
      \ he has granted according to his mercy and love.\n"
    8: "⁸ He said, “They are my very own people.\n    Surely they will not betray\
      \ me again.”\n    And he became their Savior.\n"
    9: "⁹ In all their suffering he also suffered,\n    and he personally rescued\
      \ them.\nIn his love and mercy he redeemed them.\n    He lifted them up and\
      \ carried them\n    through all the years.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But they rebelled against him\n    and grieved his Holy Spirit.\nSo he\
      \ became their enemy\n    and fought against them. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then they remembered those days of old\n    when Moses led his people\
      \ out of Egypt.\nThey cried out, “Where is the one who brought Israel through\
      \ the sea,\n    with Moses as their shepherd?\nWhere is the one who sent his\
      \ Holy Spirit\n    to be among his people?\n"
    12: "¹² Where is the one whose power was displayed\n    when Moses lifted up his\
      \ hand—\nthe one who divided the sea before them,\n    making himself famous\
      \ forever?\n"
    13: "¹³ Where is the one who led them through the bottom of the sea?\n    They\
      \ were like fine stallions\n    racing through the desert, never stumbling.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ As with cattle going down into a peaceful valley,\n    the Spirit of the\
      \ Lord gave them rest.\nYou led your people, Lord,\n    and gained a magnificent\
      \ reputation.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Lord, look down from heaven;\n    look from your holy, glorious home,\
      \ and see us.\nWhere is the passion and the might\n    you used to show on our\
      \ behalf?\n    Where are your mercy and compassion now?\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Surely you are still our Father!\n    Even if Abraham and Jacob would\
      \ disown us,\nLord, you would still be our Father.\n    You are our Redeemer\
      \ from ages past.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Lord, why have you allowed us to turn from your path?\n    Why have you\
      \ given us stubborn hearts so we no longer fear you?\nReturn and help us, for\
      \ we are your servants,\n    the tribes that are your special possession.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ How briefly your holy people possessed your holy place,\n    and now our\
      \ enemies have destroyed it.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Sometimes it seems as though we never belonged to you,\n    as though\
      \ we had never been known as your people."
  64:
    1: "¹ Oh, that you would burst from the heavens and come down!\n    How the mountains\
      \ would quake in your presence!\n"
    2: "² As fire causes wood to burn\n    and water to boil,\nyour coming would make\
      \ the nations tremble.\n    Then your enemies would learn the reason for your\
      \ fame!\n"
    3: "³ When you came down long ago,\n    you did awesome deeds beyond our highest\
      \ expectations.\n    And oh, how the mountains quaked!\n"
    4: "⁴ For since the world began,\n    no ear has heard\nand no eye has seen a\
      \ God like you,\n    who works for those who wait for him!\n"
    5: "⁵ You welcome those who gladly do good,\n    who follow godly ways.\nBut you\
      \ have been very angry with us,\n    for we are not godly.\nWe are constant\
      \ sinners;\n    how can people like us be saved?\n"
    6: "⁶ We are all infected and impure with sin.\n    When we display our righteous\
      \ deeds,\n    they are nothing but filthy rags.\nLike autumn leaves, we wither\
      \ and fall,\n    and our sins sweep us away like the wind.\n"
    7: "⁷ Yet no one calls on your name\n    or pleads with you for mercy.\nTherefore,\
      \ you have turned away from us\n    and turned us over to our sins. \n"
    8: "⁸ And yet, O Lord, you are our Father.\n    We are the clay, and you are the\
      \ potter.\n    We all are formed by your hand.\n"
    9: "⁹ Don’t be so angry with us, Lord.\n    Please don’t remember our sins forever.\n\
      Look at us, we pray,\n    and see that we are all your people.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Your holy cities are destroyed.\n    Zion is a wilderness;\n    yes, Jerusalem\
      \ is a desolate ruin.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The holy and beautiful Temple\n    where our ancestors praised you\nhas\
      \ been burned down,\n    and all the things of beauty are destroyed.\n"
    12: "¹² After all this, Lord, must you still refuse to help us?\n    Will you\
      \ continue to be silent and punish us?"
  65:
    1: "¹ The Lord says,\n“I was ready to respond, but no one asked for help.\n  \
      \  I was ready to be found, but no one was looking for me.\nI said, ‘Here I\
      \ am, here I am!’\n    to a nation that did not call on my name.\n"
    2: "² All day long I opened my arms to a rebellious people.\n    But they follow\
      \ their own evil paths\n    and their own crooked schemes.\n"
    3: "³ All day long they insult me to my face\n    by worshiping idols in their\
      \ sacred gardens.\n    They burn incense on pagan altars.\n"
    4: "⁴ At night they go out among the graves,\n    worshiping the dead.\nThey eat\
      \ the flesh of pigs\n    and make stews with other forbidden foods.\n"
    5: "⁵ Yet they say to each other,\n    ‘Don’t come too close or you will defile\
      \ me!\n    I am holier than you!’\nThese people are a stench in my nostrils,\n\
      \    an acrid smell that never goes away. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Look, my decree is written out in front of me:\n    I will not stand silent;\n\
      I will repay them in full!\n    Yes, I will repay them—\n"
    7: "⁷ both for their own sins\n    and for those of their ancestors,”\n    says\
      \ the Lord.\n“For they also burned incense on the mountains\n    and insulted\
      \ me on the hills.\n    I will pay them back in full! \n"
    8: "⁸ “But I will not destroy them all,”\n    says the Lord.\n“For just as good\
      \ grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones\n    (and someone will say, ‘Don’t\
      \ throw them all away—\n    some of those grapes are good!’),\nso I will not\
      \ destroy all Israel.\n    For I still have true servants there.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will preserve a remnant of the people of Israel\n    and of Judah to possess\
      \ my land.\nThose I choose will inherit it,\n    and my servants will live there.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The plain of Sharon will again be filled with flocks\n    for my people\
      \ who have searched for me,\n    and the valley of Achor will be a place to\
      \ pasture herds. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “But because the rest of you have forsaken the Lord\n    and have forgotten\
      \ his Temple,\nand because you have prepared feasts to honor the god of Fate\n\
      \    and have offered mixed wine to the god of Destiny,\n"
    12: "¹² now I will ‘destine’ you for the sword.\n    All of you will bow down\
      \ before the executioner.\nFor when I called, you did not answer.\n    When\
      \ I spoke, you did not listen.\nYou deliberately sinned—before my very eyes—\n\
      \    and chose to do what you know I despise.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n“My servants will eat,\n\
      \    but you will starve.\nMy servants will drink,\n    but you will be thirsty.\n\
      My servants will rejoice,\n    but you will be sad and ashamed.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ My servants will sing for joy,\n    but you will cry in sorrow and despair.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Your name will be a curse word among my people,\n    for the Sovereign\
      \ Lord will destroy you\n    and will call his true servants by another name.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ All who invoke a blessing or take an oath\n    will do so by the God of\
      \ truth.\nFor I will put aside my anger\n    and forget the evil of earlier\
      \ days. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth,\n    and no one will\
      \ even think about the old ones anymore.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Be glad; rejoice forever in my creation!\n    And look! I will create\
      \ Jerusalem as a place of happiness.\n    Her people will be a source of joy.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will rejoice over Jerusalem\n    and delight in my people.\nAnd the\
      \ sound of weeping and crying\n    will be heard in it no more. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “No longer will babies die when only a few days old.\n    No longer will\
      \ adults die before they have lived a full life.\nNo longer will people be considered\
      \ old at one hundred!\n    Only the cursed will die that young!\n"
    21: "²¹ In those days people will live in the houses they build\n    and eat the\
      \ fruit of their own vineyards.\n"
    22: "²² Unlike the past, invaders will not take their houses\n    and confiscate\
      \ their vineyards.\nFor my people will live as long as trees,\n    and my chosen\
      \ ones will have time to enjoy their hard-won gains.\n"
    23: "²³ They will not work in vain,\n    and their children will not be doomed\
      \ to misfortune.\nFor they are people blessed by the Lord,\n    and their children,\
      \ too, will be blessed.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I will answer them before they even call to me.\n    While they are still\
      \ talking about their needs,\n    I will go ahead and answer their prayers!\n"
    25: "²⁵ The wolf and the lamb will feed together.\n    The lion will eat hay like\
      \ a cow.\n    But the snakes will eat dust.\nIn those days no one will be hurt\
      \ or destroyed on my holy mountain.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!”"
  66:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says: \n“Heaven is my throne,\n    and the earth is\
      \ my footstool.\nCould you build me a temple as good as that?\n    Could you\
      \ build me such a resting place?\n"
    2: "² My hands have made both heaven and earth;\n    they and everything in them\
      \ are mine.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!\n“I will bless those who have humble\
      \ and contrite hearts,\n    who tremble at my word.\n"
    3: "³ But those who choose their own ways—\n    delighting in their detestable\
      \ sins—\n    will not have their offerings accepted.\nWhen such people sacrifice\
      \ a bull,\n    it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice.\nWhen they sacrifice\
      \ a lamb,\n    it’s as though they had sacrificed a dog!\nWhen they bring an\
      \ offering of grain,\n    they might as well offer the blood of a pig.\nWhen\
      \ they burn frankincense,\n    it’s as if they had blessed an idol.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will send them great trouble—\n    all the things they feared.\nFor when\
      \ I called, they did not answer.\n    When I spoke, they did not listen.\nThey\
      \ deliberately sinned before my very eyes\n    and chose to do what they know\
      \ I despise.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Hear this message from the Lord,\n    all you who tremble at his words:\n\
      “Your own people hate you\n    and throw you out for being loyal to my name.\n\
      ‘Let the Lord be honored!’ they scoff.\n    ‘Be joyful in him!’\n    But they\
      \ will be put to shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ What is all the commotion in the city?\n    What is that terrible noise\
      \ from the Temple?\nIt is the voice of the Lord\n    taking vengeance against\
      \ his enemies. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Before the birth pains even begin,\n    Jerusalem gives birth to a son.\n"
    8: "⁸ Who has ever seen anything as strange as this?\n    Who ever heard of such\
      \ a thing?\nHas a nation ever been born in a single day?\n    Has a country\
      \ ever come forth in a mere moment?\nBut by the time Jerusalem’s birth pains\
      \ begin,\n    her children will be born.\n"
    9: "⁹ Would I ever bring this nation to the point of birth\n    and then not deliver\
      \ it?” asks the Lord.\n“No! I would never keep this nation from being born,”\n\
      \    says your God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Rejoice with Jerusalem!\n    Be glad with her, all you who love her\n\

    11: "¹¹ Drink deeply of her glory\n    even as an infant drinks at its mother’s\

    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“I will give Jerusalem a river of peace and\

    13: "¹³ I will comfort you there in Jerusalem\n    as a mother comforts her child.”\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ When you see these things, your heart will rejoice.\n    You will flourish\
      \ like the grass!\nEveryone will see the Lord’s hand of blessing on his servants—\n\
      \    and his anger against his enemies.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ See, the Lord is coming with fire,\n    and his swift chariots roar like\
      \ a whirlwind.\nHe will bring punishment with the fury of his anger\n    and\
      \ the flaming fire of his hot rebuke.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord will punish the world by fire\n    and by his sword.\nHe will\

    17: "¹⁷ “Those who ‘consecrate’ and ‘purify’ themselves in a sacred garden with\

    18: '¹⁸ “I can see what they are doing, and I know what they are thinking. So
      I will gather all nations and peoples together, and they will see my glory. '
    19: '¹⁹ I will perform a sign among them. And I will send those who survive to
      be messengers to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (who are
      famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to all the lands beyond the sea
      that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. There they will declare my
      glory to the nations. '
    20: '²⁰ They will bring the remnant of your people back from every nation. They
      will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord.

      says the Lord. '
    21: "²¹ “And I will appoint some of them to be my priests and Levites. I, the\

    22: "²² “As surely as my new heavens and earth will remain,\n    so will you always\

    24: "²⁴ And as they go out, they will see\n    the dead bodies of those who have\
