      \ Kedar,\n    dark as the curtains of Solomon’s tents.\n"
    6: "⁶ Don’t stare at me because I am dark—\n    the sun has darkened my skin.\n\
      My brothers were angry with me;\n    they forced me to care for their vineyards,\n\
      \    so I couldn’t care for myself—my own vineyard. \n"
    7: "⁷ Tell me, my love, where are you leading your flock today?\n    Where will\

      henna with nard,\n"
    14: "¹⁴     nard and saffron,\n    fragrant calamus and cinnamon,\nwith all the\
      \ trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes,\n    and every other lovely spice.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You are a garden fountain,\n    a well of fresh water\n    streaming down\
      \ from Lebanon’s mountains.  \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Awake, north wind!\n    Rise up, south wind!\nBlow on my garden\n    and\

    8: "⁸ Even among sixty queens\n    and eighty concubines\n    and countless young\
      \ women,\n"
    9: "⁹ I would still choose my dove, my perfect one—\n    the favorite of her mother,\n\
      \    dearly loved by the one who bore her.\nThe young women see her and praise\
      \ her;\n    even queens and royal concubines sing her praises:\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Who is this, arising like the dawn,\n    as fair as the moon,\nas bright\
      \ as the sun,\n    as majestic as an army with billowing banners?” \n"
    11: "¹¹ I went down to the grove of walnut trees\n    and out to the valley to\
      \ see the new spring growth,\nto see whether the grapevines had budded\n   \
      \ or the pomegranates were in bloom.\n"

      \ of a noble man. \n"
    13: "¹³ Return, return to us, O maid of Shulam.\n    Come back, come back, that\
      \ we may see you again.\nWhy do you stare at this young woman of Shulam,\n \
      \   as she moves so gracefully between two lines of dancers?"
  7:
    1: "¹ How beautiful are your sandaled feet,\n    O queenly maiden.\nYour rounded\
      \ thighs are like jewels,\n    the work of a skilled craftsman.\n"

    10: "¹⁰ I am my lover’s,\n    and he claims me as his own.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Come, my love, let us go out to the fields\n    and spend the night among\
      \ the wildflowers.\n"
    12: "¹² Let us get up early and go to the vineyards\n    to see if the grapevines\
      \ have budded,\nif the blossoms have opened,\n    and if the pomegranates have\
      \ bloomed.\n    There I will give you my love.\n"
    13: "¹³ There the mandrakes give off their fragrance,\n    and the finest fruits\
      \ are at our door,\nnew delights as well as old,\n    which I have saved for\
      \ you, my lover."
  8:
    1: "¹ Oh, I wish you were my brother,\n    who nursed at my mother’s breasts.\n\
      Then I could kiss you no matter who was watching,\n    and no one would criticize\
      \ me.\n"
    2: "² I would bring you to my childhood home,\n    and there you would teach me.\n\

      \ is right. \n"
    5: "⁵ Who is this sweeping in from the desert,\n    leaning on her lover?\nI aroused\
      \ you under the apple tree,\n    where your mother gave you birth,\n    where\
      \ in great pain she delivered you.\n"
    6: "⁶ Place me like a seal over your heart,\n    like a seal on your arm.\nFor\
      \ love is as strong as death,\n    its jealousy as enduring as the grave.\n\
      Love flashes like fire,\n    the brightest kind of flame.\n"
    7: "⁷ Many waters cannot quench love,\n    nor can rivers drown it.\nIf a man\
      \ tried to buy love\n    with all his wealth,\n    his offer would be utterly\
      \ scorned. \n"
    8: "⁸ We have a little sister\n    too young to have breasts.\nWhat will we do\
      \ for our sister\n    if someone asks to marry her?\n"
    9: "⁹ If she is a virgin, like a wall,\n    we will protect her with a silver\
      \ tower.\nBut if she is promiscuous, like a swinging door,\n    we will block\
      \ her door with a cedar bar. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I was a virgin, like a wall;\n    now my breasts are like towers.\nWhen\
      \ my lover looks at me,\n    he is delighted with what he sees. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Solomon has a vineyard at Baal-hamon,\n    which he leases out to tenant\
      \ farmers.\nEach of them pays a thousand pieces of silver\n    for harvesting\
      \ its fruit.\n"
    12: "¹² But my vineyard is mine to give,\n    and Solomon need not pay a thousand\
      \ pieces of silver.\nBut I will give two hundred pieces\n    to those who care\
      \ for its vines. \n"
    13: "¹³ O my darling, lingering in the gardens,\n    your companions are fortunate\
      \ to hear your voice.\n    Let me hear it, too! \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Come away, my love! Be like a gazelle\n    or a young stag on the mountains\
      \ of spices."
