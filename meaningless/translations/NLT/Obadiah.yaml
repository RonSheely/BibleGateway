Obadiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ This is the vision that the Sovereign Lord revealed to Obadiah concerning\
      \ the land of Edom.\nWe have heard a message from the Lord\n    that an ambassador\
      \ was sent to the nations to say,\n“Get ready, everyone!\n    Let’s assemble\
      \ our armies and attack Edom!” \n"
    2: "² The Lord says to Edom,\n“I will cut you down to size among the nations;\n\
      \    you will be greatly despised.\n"
    3: "³ You have been deceived by your own pride\n    because you live in a rock\
      \ fortress\n    and make your home high in the mountains.\n‘Who can ever reach\
      \ us way up here?’\n    you ask boastfully.\n"
    4: "⁴ But even if you soar as high as eagles\n    and build your nest among the\
      \ stars,\nI will bring you crashing down,”\n    says the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ “If thieves came at night and robbed you\n    (what a disaster awaits you!),\n\
      \    they would not take everything.\nThose who harvest grapes\n    always leave\
      \ a few for the poor.\n    But your enemies will wipe you out completely!\n"
    6: "⁶ Every nook and cranny of Edom\n    will be searched and looted.\n    Every\
      \ treasure will be found and taken. \n"
    7: "⁷ “All your allies will turn against you.\n    They will help to chase you\
      \ from your land.\nThey will promise you peace\n    while plotting to deceive\
      \ and destroy you.\nYour trusted friends will set traps for you,\n    and you\
      \ won’t even know about it.\n"
    8: "⁸ At that time not a single wise person\n    will be left in the whole land\
      \ of Edom,”\n    says the Lord.\n“For on the mountains of Edom\n    I will destroy\
      \ everyone who has understanding.\n"
    9: "⁹ The mightiest warriors of Teman\n    will be terrified,\nand everyone on\
      \ the mountains of Edom\n    will be cut down in the slaughter. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Because of the violence you did\n    to your close relatives in Israel,\n\
      you will be filled with shame\n    and destroyed forever.\n"
    11: "¹¹ When they were invaded,\n    you stood aloof, refusing to help them.\n\
      Foreign invaders carried off their wealth\n    and cast lots to divide up Jerusalem,\n\
      \    but you acted like one of Israel’s enemies. \n"
    12: "¹² “You should not have gloated\n    when they exiled your relatives to distant\
      \ lands.\nYou should not have rejoiced\n    when the people of Judah suffered\
      \ such misfortune.\nYou should not have spoken arrogantly\n    in that terrible\
      \ time of trouble.\n"
    13: "¹³ You should not have plundered the land of Israel\n    when they were suffering\
      \ such calamity.\nYou should not have gloated over their destruction\n    when\
      \ they were suffering such calamity.\nYou should not have seized their wealth\n\
      \    when they were suffering such calamity.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You should not have stood at the crossroads,\n    killing those who tried\
      \ to escape.\nYou should not have captured the survivors\n    and handed them\
      \ over in their terrible time of trouble. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “The day is near when I, the Lord,\n    will judge all godless nations!\n\
      As you have done to Israel,\n    so it will be done to you.\nAll your evil deeds\n\
      \    will fall back on your own heads.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Just as you swallowed up my people\n    on my holy mountain,\nso you and\
      \ the surrounding nations\n    will swallow the punishment I pour out on you.\n\
      Yes, all you nations will drink and stagger\n    and disappear from history.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “But Jerusalem will become a refuge for those who escape;\n    it will\
      \ be a holy place.\nAnd the people of Israel will come back\n    to reclaim\
      \ their inheritance.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The people of Israel will be a raging fire,\n    and Edom a field of dry\
      \ stubble.\nThe descendants of Joseph will be a flame\n    roaring across the\
      \ field, devouring everything.\nThere will be no survivors in Edom.\n    I,\
      \ the Lord, have spoken! \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Then my people living in the Negev\n    will occupy the mountains of\
      \ Edom.\nThose living in the foothills of Judah\n    will possess the Philistine\
      \ plains\n    and take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria.\nAnd the people\
      \ of Benjamin\n    will occupy the land of Gilead.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The exiles of Israel will return to their land\n    and occupy the Phoenician\
      \ coast as far north as Zarephath.\nThe captives from Jerusalem exiled in the\
      \ north\n    will return home and resettle the towns of the Negev.\n"
    21: "²¹ Those who have been rescued will go up to Mount Zion in Jerusalem\n  \
      \  to rule over the mountains of Edom.\nAnd the Lord himself will be king!”"
