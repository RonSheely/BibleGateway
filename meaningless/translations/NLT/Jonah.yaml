Jonah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The Lord gave this message to Jonah son of Amittai: '
    2: "² “Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce my judgment against\
      \ it because I have seen how wicked its people are.” \n"
    3: "³ But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction to get away from the\
      \ Lord. He went down to the port of Joppa, where he found a ship leaving for\
      \ Tarshish. He bought a ticket and went on board, hoping to escape from the\
      \ Lord by sailing to Tarshish. \n"
    4: '⁴ But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm
      that threatened to break the ship apart. '
    5: "⁵ Fearing for their lives, the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for\
      \ help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship.\nBut all this time\
      \ Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold. "
    6: "⁶ So the captain went down after him. “How can you sleep at a time like this?”\
      \ he shouted. “Get up and pray to your god! Maybe he will pay attention to us\
      \ and spare our lives.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then the crew cast lots to see which of them had offended the gods and caused
      the terrible storm. When they did this, the lots identified Jonah as the culprit. '
    8: "⁸ “Why has this awful storm come down on us?” they demanded. “Who are you?\
      \ What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality?”\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Jonah answered, “I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven,\
      \ who made the sea and the land.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ The sailors were terrified when they heard this, for he had already told
      them he was running away from the Lord. “Oh, why did you do it?” they groaned. '
    11: "¹¹ And since the storm was getting worse all the time, they asked him, “What\
      \ should we do to you to stop this storm?” \n"
    12: "¹² “Throw me into the sea,” Jonah said, “and it will become calm again. I\
      \ know that this terrible storm is all my fault.” \n"
    13: '¹³ Instead, the sailors rowed even harder to get the ship to the land. But
      the stormy sea was too violent for them, and they couldn’t make it. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then they cried out to the Lord, Jonah’s God. “O Lord,” they pleaded,\
      \ “don’t make us die for this man’s sin. And don’t hold us responsible for his\
      \ death. O Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons.”\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and
      the storm stopped at once! '
    16: "¹⁶ The sailors were awestruck by the Lord’s great power, and they offered\
      \ him a sacrifice and vowed to serve him. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ Now the Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah
      was inside the fish for three days and three nights.
  2:
    1: '¹ Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from inside the fish. '
    2: "² He said,\n“I cried out to the Lord in my great trouble,\n    and he answered\
      \ me.\nI called to you from the land of the dead,\n    and Lord, you heard me!\n"
    3: "³ You threw me into the ocean depths,\n    and I sank down to the heart of\
      \ the sea.\nThe mighty waters engulfed me;\n    I was buried beneath your wild\
      \ and stormy waves.\n"
    4: "⁴ Then I said, ‘O Lord, you have driven me from your presence.\n    Yet I\
      \ will look once more toward your holy Temple.’ \n"
    5: "⁵ “I sank beneath the waves,\n    and the waters closed over me.\n    Seaweed\
      \ wrapped itself around my head.\n"
    6: "⁶ I sank down to the very roots of the mountains.\n    I was imprisoned in\
      \ the earth,\n    whose gates lock shut forever.\nBut you, O Lord my God,\n\
      \    snatched me from the jaws of death!\n"
    7: "⁷ As my life was slipping away,\n    I remembered the Lord.\nAnd my earnest\
      \ prayer went out to you\n    in your holy Temple.\n"
    8: "⁸ Those who worship false gods\n    turn their backs on all God’s mercies.\n"
    9: "⁹ But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise,\n    and I will\
      \ fulfill all my vows.\n    For my salvation comes from the Lord alone.” \n"
    10: ¹⁰ Then the Lord ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach.
  3:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord spoke to Jonah a second time: '
    2: "² “Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh, and deliver the message I have\
      \ given you.” \n"
    3: '³ This time Jonah obeyed the Lord’s command and went to Nineveh, a city so
      large that it took three days to see it all. '
    4: '⁴ On the day Jonah entered the city, he shouted to the crowds: “Forty days
      from now Nineveh will be destroyed!” '
    5: "⁵ The people of Nineveh believed God’s message, and from the greatest to the\
      \ least, they declared a fast and put on burlap to show their sorrow. \n"
    6: '⁶ When the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying, he stepped down from
      his throne and took off his royal robes. He dressed himself in burlap and sat
      on a heap of ashes. '
    7: "⁷ Then the king and his nobles sent this decree throughout the city:\n“No\
      \ one, not even the animals from your herds and flocks, may eat or drink anything\
      \ at all. "
    8: '⁸ People and animals alike must wear garments of mourning, and everyone must
      pray earnestly to God. They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their
      violence. '
    9: "⁹ Who can tell? Perhaps even yet God will change his mind and hold back his\
      \ fierce anger from destroying us.” \n"
    10: ¹⁰ When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil
      ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened.
  4:
    1: '¹ This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry. '
    2: '² So he complained to the Lord about it: “Didn’t I say before I left home
      that you would do this, Lord? That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that
      you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with
      unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people. '
    3: "³ Just kill me now, Lord! I’d rather be dead than alive if what I predicted\
      \ will not happen.” \n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord replied, “Is it right for you to be angry about this?” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit
      under as he waited to see what would happen to the city. '
    6: "⁶ And the Lord God arranged for a leafy plant to grow there, and soon it spread\
      \ its broad leaves over Jonah’s head, shading him from the sun. This eased his\
      \ discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant. \n"
    7: '⁷ But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate
      through the stem of the plant so that it withered away. '
    8: "⁸ And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow\
      \ on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to\
      \ die. “Death is certainly better than living like this!” he exclaimed. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry because the plant\
      \ died?”\n“Yes,” Jonah retorted, “even angry enough to die!” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Lord said, “You feel sorry about the plant, though you did nothing
      to put it there. It came quickly and died quickly. '
    11: ¹¹ But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness,
      not to mention all the animals. Shouldn’t I feel sorry for such a great city?”
