Ephesians:
  1:
    1: "¹ This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of\
      \ Christ Jesus.\nI am writing to God’s holy people in Ephesus, who are faithful\
      \ followers of Christ Jesus. \n"
    2: "² May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. \n"
    3: '³ All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
      us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united
      with Christ. '
    4: '⁴ Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be
      holy and without fault in his eyes. '
    5: '⁵ God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to
      himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him
      great pleasure. '
    6: '⁶ So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong
      to his dear Son. '
    7: '⁷ He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the
      blood of his Son and forgave our sins. '
    8: "⁸ He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ God has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ—which is
      to fulfill his own good plan. '
    10: '¹⁰ And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together
      under the authority of Christ—everything in heaven and on earth. '
    11: "¹¹ Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance\
      \ from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according\
      \ to his plan. \n"
    12: '¹² God’s purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would
      bring praise and glory to God. '
    13: '¹³ And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God
      saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by
      giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. '
    14: "¹⁴ The Spirit is God’s guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he\
      \ promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so\
      \ we would praise and glorify him. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Ever since I first heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus and your
      love for God’s people everywhere, '
    16: '¹⁶ I have not stopped thanking God for you. I pray for you constantly, '
    17: '¹⁷ asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you
      spiritual wisdom and insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God. '
    18: "¹⁸ I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand\
      \ the confident hope he has given to those he called—his holy people who are\
      \ his rich and glorious inheritance. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God’s
      power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power '
    20: '²⁰ that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of honor
      at God’s right hand in the heavenly realms. '
    21: '²¹ Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything
      else—not only in this world but also in the world to come. '
    22: '²² God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him
      head over all things for the benefit of the church. '
    23: ²³ And the church is his body; it is made full and complete by Christ, who
      fills all things everywhere with himself.
  2:
    1: '¹ Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins. '
    2: '² You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil—the
      commander of the powers in the unseen world. He is the spirit at work in the
      hearts of those who refuse to obey God. '
    3: "³ All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations\
      \ of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God’s anger, just\
      \ like everyone else. \n"
    4: '⁴ But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much, '
    5: '⁵ that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when
      he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God’s grace that you have been
      saved!) '
    6: '⁶ For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him
      in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus. '
    7: "⁷ So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible\
      \ wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for\
      \ us who are united with Christ Jesus. \n"
    8: '⁸ God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit
      for this; it is a gift from God. '
    9: '⁹ Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us
      can boast about it. '
    10: "¹⁰ For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus,\
      \ so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Don’t forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders. You were called “uncircumcised
      heathens” by the Jews, who were proud of their circumcision, even though it
      affected only their bodies and not their hearts. '
    12: '¹² In those days you were living apart from Christ. You were excluded from
      citizenship among the people of Israel, and you did not know the covenant promises
      God had made to them. You lived in this world without God and without hope. '
    13: "¹³ But now you have been united with Christ Jesus. Once you were far away\
      \ from God, but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles
      into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of
      hostility that separated us. '
    15: '¹⁵ He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations.
      He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people
      from the two groups. '
    16: "¹⁶ Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of\
      \ his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from
      him, and peace to the Jews who were near. '
    18: "¹⁸ Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because\
      \ of what Christ has done for us. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens
      along with all of God’s holy people. You are members of God’s family. '
    20: '²⁰ Together, we are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and
      the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself. '
    21: '²¹ We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the
      Lord. '
    22: ²² Through him you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where
      God lives by his Spirit.
  3:
    1: '¹ When I think of all this, I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the benefit
      of you Gentiles . . . '
    2: '² assuming, by the way, that you know God gave me the special responsibility
      of extending his grace to you Gentiles. '
    3: '³ As I briefly wrote earlier, God himself revealed his mysterious plan to
      me. '
    4: '⁴ As you read what I have written, you will understand my insight into this
      plan regarding Christ. '
    5: "⁵ God did not reveal it to previous generations, but now by his Spirit he\
      \ has revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets. \n"
    6: '⁶ And this is God’s plan: Both Gentiles and Jews who believe the Good News
      share equally in the riches inherited by God’s children. Both are part of the
      same body, and both enjoy the promise of blessings because they belong to Christ
      Jesus. '
    7: "⁷ By God’s grace and mighty power, I have been given the privilege of serving\
      \ him by spreading this Good News. \n"
    8: '⁸ Though I am the least deserving of all God’s people, he graciously gave
      me the privilege of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available
      to them in Christ. '
    9: "⁹ I was chosen to explain to everyone this mysterious plan that God, the Creator\
      \ of all things, had kept secret from the beginning. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ God’s purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom
      in its rich variety to all the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly
      places. '
    11: "¹¹ This was his eternal plan, which he carried out through Christ Jesus our\
      \ Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come boldly and confidently
      into God’s presence. '
    13: "¹³ So please don’t lose heart because of my trials here. I am suffering for\
      \ you, so you should feel honored. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father, '
    15: '¹⁵ the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth. '
    16: '¹⁶ I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you
      with inner strength through his Spirit. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your
      roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. '
    18: '¹⁸ And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should,
      how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. '
    19: "¹⁹ May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand\
      \ fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power\
      \ that comes from God. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within
      us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think. '
    21: ²¹ Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations
      forever and ever! Amen.
  4:
    1: '¹ Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy
      of your calling, for you have been called by God. '
    2: '² Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance
      for each other’s faults because of your love. '
    3: '³ Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves
      together with peace. '
    4: "⁴ For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one\
      \ glorious hope for the future. \n"
    5: "⁵ There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,\n"
    6: "⁶ one God and Father of all,\nwho is over all, in all, and living through\
      \ all. \n"
    7: '⁷ However, he has given each one of us a special gift through the generosity
      of Christ. '
    8: "⁸ That is why the Scriptures say, \n“When he ascended to the heights,\n  \
      \  he led a crowd of captives\n    and gave gifts to his people.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Notice that it says “he ascended.” This clearly means that Christ also descended
      to our lowly world. '
    10: "¹⁰ And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than all\
      \ the heavens, so that he might fill the entire universe with himself. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets,
      the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. '
    12: '¹² Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do his work and build
      up the church, the body of Christ. '
    13: "¹³ This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge\
      \ of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full\
      \ and complete standard of Christ. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won’t be tossed and
      blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people
      try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and
      more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. '
    16: "¹⁶ He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its\
      \ own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is\
      \ healthy and growing and full of love. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ With the Lord’s authority I say this: Live no longer as the Gentiles do,
      for they are hopelessly confused. '
    18: '¹⁸ Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives
      because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him. '
    19: "¹⁹ They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly\
      \ practice every kind of impurity. \n"
    20: '²⁰ But that isn’t what you learned about Christ. '
    21: '²¹ Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes
      from him, '
    22: '²² throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is
      corrupted by lust and deception. '
    23: '²³ Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. '
    24: "²⁴ Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are
      all parts of the same body. '
    26: '²⁶ And “don’t sin by letting anger control you.” Don’t let the sun go down
      while you are still angry, '
    27: "²⁷ for anger gives a foothold to the devil. \n"
    28: '²⁸ If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard
      work, and then give generously to others in need. '
    29: "²⁹ Don’t use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and\
      \ helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.\
      \ \n"
    30: "³⁰ And do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember,\
      \ he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the\
      \ day of redemption. \n"
    31: '³¹ Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well
      as all types of evil behavior. '
    32: ³² Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just
      as God through Christ has forgiven you.
  5:
    1: '¹ Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children. '
    2: "² Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved\
      \ us and offered himself as a sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God. \n"
    3: '³ Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins
      have no place among God’s people. '
    4: '⁴ Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes—these are not for you. Instead,
      let there be thankfulness to God. '
    5: "⁵ You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the\
      \ Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping\
      \ the things of this world. \n"
    6: '⁶ Don’t be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of
      God will fall on all who disobey him. '
    7: '⁷ Don’t participate in the things these people do. '
    8: '⁸ For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord.
      So live as people of light! '
    9: "⁹ For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose
      them. '
    12: '¹² It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in
      secret. '
    13: '¹³ But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, '
    14: "¹⁴ for the light makes everything visible. This is why it is said, \n“Awake,\
      \ O sleeper,\n    rise up from the dead,\n    and Christ will give you light.”\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So be careful how you live. Don’t live like fools, but like those who
      are wise. '
    16: '¹⁶ Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days. '
    17: '¹⁷ Don’t act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do. '
    18: '¹⁸ Don’t be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be
      filled with the Holy Spirit, '
    19: '¹⁹ singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making
      music to the Lord in your hearts. '
    20: "²⁰ And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord\
      \ Jesus Christ. \n"
    21: "²¹ And further, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. \n"
    22: '²² For wives, this means submit to your husbands as to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church.
      He is the Savior of his body, the church. '
    24: "²⁴ As the church submits to Christ, so you wives should submit to your husbands\
      \ in everything. \n"
    25: '²⁵ For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church.
      He gave up his life for her '
    26: '²⁶ to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God’s word. '
    27: '²⁷ He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot
      or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault. '
    28: '²⁸ In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their
      own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself. '
    29: '²⁹ No one hates his own body but feeds and cares for it, just as Christ cares
      for the church. '
    30: "³⁰ And we are members of his body. \n"
    31: '³¹ As the Scriptures say, “A man leaves his father and mother and is joined
      to his wife, and the two are united into one.” '
    32: '³² This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and
      the church are one. '
    33: ³³ So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the
      wife must respect her husband.
  6:
    1: '¹ Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is
      the right thing to do. '
    2: '² “Honor your father and mother.” This is the first commandment with a promise: '
    3: "³ If you honor your father and mother, “things will go well for you, and you\
      \ will have a long life on the earth.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them.\
      \ Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them
      sincerely as you would serve Christ. '
    6: '⁶ Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. As
      slaves of Christ, do the will of God with all your heart. '
    7: '⁷ Work with enthusiasm, as though you were working for the Lord rather than
      for people. '
    8: "⁸ Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do, whether\
      \ we are slaves or free. \n"
    9: "⁹ Masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Don’t threaten them; remember,\
      \ you both have the same Master in heaven, and he has no favorites. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. '
    11: '¹¹ Put on all of God’s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against
      all strategies of the devil. '
    12: "¹² For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil\
      \ rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this\
      \ dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places. \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore, put on every piece of God’s armor so you will be able to resist
      the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing
      firm. '
    14: '¹⁴ Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of
      God’s righteousness. '
    15: '¹⁵ For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you
      will be fully prepared. '
    16: '¹⁶ In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery
      arrows of the devil. '
    17: "¹⁷ Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which\
      \ is the word of God. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and\
      \ be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly
      explain God’s mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike. '
    20: "²⁰ I am in chains now, still preaching this message as God’s ambassador.\
      \ So pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him, as I should. \n"
    21: '²¹ To bring you up to date, Tychicus will give you a full report about what
      I am doing and how I am getting along. He is a beloved brother and faithful
      helper in the Lord’s work. '
    22: "²² I have sent him to you for this very purpose—to let you know how we are\
      \ doing and to encourage you. \n"
    23: '²³ Peace be with you, dear brothers and sisters, and may God the Father and
      the Lord Jesus Christ give you love with faithfulness. '
    24: ²⁴ May God’s grace be eternally upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ.
