Phillippians:
  1:
    1: "¹ This letter is from Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus.\nI am writing\
      \ to all of God’s holy people in Philippi who belong to Christ Jesus, including\
      \ the church leaders and deacons. \n"
    2: "² May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. \n"
    3: '³ Every time I think of you, I give thanks to my God. '
    4: '⁴ Whenever I pray, I make my requests for all of you with joy, '
    5: '⁵ for you have been my partners in spreading the Good News about Christ from
      the time you first heard it until now. '
    6: "⁶ And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue\
      \ his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ So it is right that I should feel as I do about all of you, for you have
      a special place in my heart. You share with me the special favor of God, both
      in my imprisonment and in defending and confirming the truth of the Good News. '
    8: "⁸ God knows how much I love you and long for you with the tender compassion\
      \ of Christ Jesus. \n"
    9: '⁹ I pray that your love will overflow more and more, and that you will keep
      on growing in knowledge and understanding. '
    10: '¹⁰ For I want you to understand what really matters, so that you may live
      pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ’s return. '
    11: "¹¹ May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous\
      \ character produced in your life by Jesus Christ—for this will bring much glory\
      \ and praise to God. \n"
    12: '¹² And I want you to know, my dear brothers and sisters, that everything
      that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News. '
    13: '¹³ For everyone here, including the whole palace guard, knows that I am in
      chains because of Christ. '
    14: "¹⁴ And because of my imprisonment, most of the believers here have gained\
      \ confidence and boldly speak God’s message without fear. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ It’s true that some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry. But others
      preach about Christ with pure motives. '
    16: '¹⁶ They preach because they love me, for they know I have been appointed
      to defend the Good News. '
    17: '¹⁷ Those others do not have pure motives as they preach about Christ. They
      preach with selfish ambition, not sincerely, intending to make my chains more
      painful to me. '
    18: '¹⁸ But that doesn’t matter. Whether their motives are false or genuine, the
      message about Christ is being preached either way, so I rejoice. And I will
      continue to rejoice. '
    19: "¹⁹ For I know that as you pray for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps\
      \ me, this will lead to my deliverance. \n"
    20: '²⁰ For I fully expect and hope that I will never be ashamed, but that I will
      continue to be bold for Christ, as I have been in the past. And I trust that
      my life will bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die. '
    21: '²¹ For to me, living means living for Christ, and dying is even better. '
    22: '²² But if I live, I can do more fruitful work for Christ. So I really don’t
      know which is better. '
    23: '²³ I’m torn between two desires: I long to go and be with Christ, which would
      be far better for me. '
    24: "²⁴ But for your sakes, it is better that I continue to live. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Knowing this, I am convinced that I will remain alive so I can continue
      to help all of you grow and experience the joy of your faith. '
    26: "²⁶ And when I come to you again, you will have even more reason to take pride\
      \ in Christ Jesus because of what he is doing through me. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Above all, you must live as citizens of heaven, conducting yourselves
      in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come and see
      you again or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing together
      with one spirit and one purpose, fighting together for the faith, which is the
      Good News. '
    28: '²⁸ Don’t be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to
      them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved,
      even by God himself. '
    29: '²⁹ For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but
      also the privilege of suffering for him. '
    30: ³⁰ We are in this struggle together. You have seen my struggle in the past,
      and you know that I am still in the midst of it.
  2:
    1: '¹ Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his
      love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate? '
    2: "² Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving\
      \ one another, and working together with one mind and purpose. \n"
    3: '³ Don’t be selfish; don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others
      as better than yourselves. '
    4: "⁴ Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others,\
      \ too. \n"
    5: "⁵ You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had. \n"
    6: "⁶ Though he was God,\n    he did not think of equality with God\n    as something\
      \ to cling to.\n"
    7: "⁷ Instead, he gave up his divine privileges;\n    he took the humble position\
      \ of a slave\n    and was born as a human being.\nWhen he appeared in human\
      \ form,\n"
    8: "⁸     he humbled himself in obedience to God\n    and died a criminal’s death\
      \ on a cross. \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honor\n    and gave\
      \ him the name above all other names,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,\n    in heaven and on\
      \ earth and under the earth,\n"
    11: "¹¹ and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord,\n    to the glory\
      \ of God the Father. \n"
    12: '¹² Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you.
      And now that I am away, it is even more important. Work hard to show the results
      of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear. '
    13: "¹³ For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what\
      \ pleases him. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Do everything without complaining and arguing, '
    15: '¹⁵ so that no one can criticize you. Live clean, innocent lives as children
      of God, shining like bright lights in a world full of crooked and perverse people. '
    16: '¹⁶ Hold firmly to the word of life; then, on the day of Christ’s return,
      I will be proud that I did not run the race in vain and that my work was not
      useless. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will rejoice even if I lose my life, pouring it out like a liquid
      offering to God, just like your faithful service is an offering to God. And
      I want all of you to share that joy. '
    18: "¹⁸ Yes, you should rejoice, and I will share your joy. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ If the Lord Jesus is willing, I hope to send Timothy to you soon for a
      visit. Then he can cheer me up by telling me how you are getting along. '
    20: '²⁰ I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare. '
    21: '²¹ All the others care only for themselves and not for what matters to Jesus
      Christ. '
    22: '²² But you know how Timothy has proved himself. Like a son with his father,
      he has served with me in preaching the Good News. '
    23: '²³ I hope to send him to you just as soon as I find out what is going to
      happen to me here. '
    24: "²⁴ And I have confidence from the Lord that I myself will come to see you\
      \ soon. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Meanwhile, I thought I should send Epaphroditus back to you. He is a true
      brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier. And he was your messenger to help me
      in my need. '
    26: '²⁶ I am sending him because he has been longing to see you, and he was very
      distressed that you heard he was ill. '
    27: "²⁷ And he certainly was ill; in fact, he almost died. But God had mercy on\
      \ him—and also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow after another. \n"
    28: '²⁸ So I am all the more anxious to send him back to you, for I know you will
      be glad to see him, and then I will not be so worried about you. '
    29: '²⁹ Welcome him in the Lord’s love and with great joy, and give him the honor
      that people like him deserve. '
    30: ³⁰ For he risked his life for the work of Christ, and he was at the point
      of death while doing for me what you couldn’t do from far away.
  3:
    1: "¹ Whatever happens, my dear brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord. I never\
      \ get tired of telling you these things, and I do it to safeguard your faith.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² Watch out for those dogs, those people who do evil, those mutilators who
      say you must be circumcised to be saved. '
    3: '³ For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised.
      We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human
      effort, '
    4: "⁴ though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed,\
      \ if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen
      of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin—a real Hebrew if there ever
      was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience
      to the Jewish law. '
    6: "⁶ I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness,\
      \ I obeyed the law without fault. \n"
    7: '⁷ I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless
      because of what Christ has done. '
    8: '⁸ Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value
      of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else,
      counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ '
    9: '⁹ and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through
      obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ. For God’s
      way of making us right with himself depends on faith. '
    10: '¹⁰ I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him
      from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death, '
    11: "¹¹ so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the\
      \ dead! \n"
    12: '¹² I don’t mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that
      I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection
      for which Christ Jesus first possessed me. '
    13: '¹³ No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on
      this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, '
    14: "¹⁴ I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize\
      \ for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things. If you disagree
      on some point, I believe God will make it plain to you. '
    16: "¹⁶ But we must hold on to the progress we have already made. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from
      those who follow our example. '
    18: '¹⁸ For I have told you often before, and I say it again with tears in my
      eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the
      cross of Christ. '
    19: '¹⁹ They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag
      about shameful things, and they think only about this life here on earth. '
    20: '²⁰ But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And
      we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior. '
    21: ²¹ He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies
      like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under
      his control.
  4:
    1: "¹ Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stay true to the Lord. I love you\
      \ and long to see you, dear friends, for you are my joy and the crown I receive\
      \ for my work. \n"
    2: '² Now I appeal to Euodia and Syntyche. Please, because you belong to the Lord,
      settle your disagreement. '
    3: "³ And I ask you, my true partner, to help these two women, for they worked\
      \ hard with me in telling others the Good News. They worked along with Clement\
      \ and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are written in the Book of Life.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice! '
    5: "⁵ Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord\
      \ is coming soon. \n"
    6: '⁶ Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what
      you need, and thank him for all he has done. '
    7: "⁷ Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand.\
      \ His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. \n"
    8: '⁸ And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on
      what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable.
      Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. '
    9: "⁹ Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything\
      \ you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ How I praise the Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you
      have always been concerned for me, but you didn’t have the chance to help me. '
    11: '¹¹ Not that I was ever in need, for I have learned how to be content with
      whatever I have. '
    12: '¹² I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned
      the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or
      empty, with plenty or little. '
    13: '¹³ For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength. '
    14: "¹⁴ Even so, you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ As you know, you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial
      help when I first brought you the Good News and then traveled on from Macedonia.
      No other church did this. '
    16: '¹⁶ Even when I was in Thessalonica you sent help more than once. '
    17: "¹⁷ I don’t say this because I want a gift from you. Rather, I want you to\
      \ receive a reward for your kindness. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ At the moment I have all I need—and more! I am generously supplied with
      the gifts you sent me with Epaphroditus. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice
      that is acceptable and pleasing to God. '
    19: "¹⁹ And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from\
      \ his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Now all glory to God our Father forever and ever! Amen. \n"
    21: '²¹ Give my greetings to each of God’s holy people—all who belong to Christ
      Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their greetings. '
    22: "²² And all the rest of God’s people send you greetings, too, especially those\
      \ in Caesar’s household. \n"
    23: ²³ May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
