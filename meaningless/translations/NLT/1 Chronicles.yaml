    14: '¹⁴ The Levites who returned were Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam,

    17: '¹⁷ The gatekeepers who returned were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and
      their relatives. Shallum was the chief gatekeeper. '
    18: '¹⁸ Prior to this time, they were responsible for the King’s Gate on the east
      side. These men served as gatekeepers for the camps of the Levites. '
    19: "¹⁹ Shallum was the son of Kore, a descendant of Abiasaph, from the clan of\
      \ Korah. He and his relatives, the Korahites, were responsible for guarding\
      \ the entrance to the sanctuary, just as their ancestors had guarded the Tabernacle\

    20: '²⁰ Phinehas son of Eleazar had been in charge of the gatekeepers in earlier
      times, and the Lord had been with him. '
    21: "²¹ And later Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was responsible for guarding the\
      \ entrance to the Tabernacle. \n"
    22: '²² In all, there were 212 gatekeepers in those days, and they were listed
      according to the genealogies in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had
      appointed their ancestors because they were reliable men. '
    23: '²³ These gatekeepers and their descendants, by their divisions, were responsible
      for guarding the entrance to the house of the Lord when that house was a tent. '
    24: '²⁴ The gatekeepers were stationed on all four sides—east, west, north, and
      south. '
    25: "²⁵ Their relatives in the villages came regularly to share their duties for\
      \ seven-day periods. \n"
    26: '²⁶ The four chief gatekeepers, all Levites, were trusted officials, for they
      were responsible for the rooms and treasuries at the house of God. '
    27: "²⁷ They would spend the night around the house of God, since it was their\
      \ duty to guard it and to open the gates every morning. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Some of the gatekeepers were assigned to care for the various articles
      used in worship. They checked them in and out to avoid any loss. '
    29: '²⁹ Others were responsible for the furnishings, the items in the sanctuary,
      and the supplies, such as choice flour, wine, olive oil, frankincense, and spices. '
    30: '³⁰ But it was the priests who blended the spices. '
    31: '³¹ Mattithiah, a Levite and the oldest son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted
      with baking the bread used in the offerings. '
    32: "³² And some members of the clan of Kohath were in charge of preparing the\
      \ bread to be set on the table each Sabbath day. \n"
    33: '³³ The musicians, all prominent Levites, lived at the Temple. They were exempt
      from other responsibilities since they were on duty at all hours. '
    34: "³⁴ All these men lived in Jerusalem. They were the heads of Levite families\
      \ and were listed as prominent leaders in their genealogical records. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Jeiel (the father of Gibeon) lived in the town of Gibeon. His wife’s name
      was Maacah, '
    36: '³⁶ and his oldest son was named Abdon. Jeiel’s other sons were Zur, Kish,
      Baal, Ner, Nadab, '

  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Philistines attacked Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them.
      Many were slaughtered on the slopes of Mount Gilboa. '
    2: '² The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons, and they killed three of
      his sons—Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malkishua. '
    3: "³ The fighting grew very fierce around Saul, and the Philistine archers caught\
      \ up with him and wounded him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Saul groaned to his armor bearer, “Take your sword and kill me before these\
      \ pagan Philistines come to taunt and torture me.”\nBut his armor bearer was\
      \ afraid and would not do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. "
    5: '⁵ When his armor bearer realized that Saul was dead, he fell on his own sword
      and died. '
    6: "⁶ So Saul and his three sons died there together, bringing his dynasty to\
      \ an end. \n"
    7: "⁷ When all the Israelites in the Jezreel Valley saw that their army had fled\
      \ and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled.\
      \ So the Philistines moved in and occupied their towns. \n"
    8: '⁸ The next day, when the Philistines went out to strip the dead, they found
      the bodies of Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa. '
    9: '⁹ So they stripped off Saul’s armor and cut off his head. Then they proclaimed
      the good news of Saul’s death before their idols and to the people throughout
      the land of Philistia. '
    10: "¹⁰ They placed his armor in the temple of their gods, and they fastened his\
      \ head to the temple of Dagon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when everyone in Jabesh-gilead heard about everything the Philistines
      had done to Saul, '
    12: "¹² all their mighty warriors brought the bodies of Saul and his sons back\
      \ to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones beneath the great tree at Jabesh,\
      \ and they fasted for seven days. \n"
    13: '¹³ So Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord. He failed to obey
      the Lord’s command, and he even consulted a medium '
    14: ¹⁴ instead of asking the Lord for guidance. So the Lord killed him and turned
      the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then all Israel gathered before David at Hebron and told him, “We are your
      own flesh and blood. '
    2: "² In the past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who really led the\
      \ forces of Israel. And the Lord your God told you, ‘You will be the shepherd\
      \ of my people Israel. You will be the leader of my people Israel.’” \n"
    3: "³ So there at Hebron, David made a covenant before the Lord with all the elders\
      \ of Israel. And they anointed him king of Israel, just as the Lord had promised\
      \ through Samuel. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (or Jebus, as it used to be
      called), where the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land, were living. '
    5: "⁵ The people of Jebus taunted David, saying, “You’ll never get in here!” But\
      \ David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ David had said to his troops, “Whoever is first to attack the Jebusites\
      \ will become the commander of my armies!” And Joab, the son of David’s sister\
      \ Zeruiah, was first to attack, so he became the commander of David’s armies.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ David made the fortress his home, and that is why it is called the City
      of David. '
    8: '⁸ He extended the city from the supporting terraces to the surrounding area,
      while Joab rebuilt the rest of Jerusalem. '
    9: "⁹ And David became more and more powerful, because the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\
      \ was with him. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ These are the leaders of David’s mighty warriors. Together with all Israel,\
      \ they decided to make David their king, just as the Lord had promised concerning\
      \ Israel. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Here is the record of David’s mightiest warriors: The first was Jashobeam\
      \ the Hacmonite, who was leader of the Three—the mightiest warriors among David’s\
      \ men. He once used his spear to kill 300 enemy warriors in a single battle.\
      \ \n"
    12: '¹² Next in rank among the Three was Eleazar son of Dodai, a descendant of
      Ahoah. '
    13: '¹³ He was with David when the Philistines gathered for battle at Pas-dammim
      and attacked the Israelites in a field full of barley. The Israelite army fled, '
    14: "¹⁴ but Eleazar and David held their ground in the middle of the field and\
      \ beat back the Philistines. So the Lord saved them by giving them a great victory.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Once when David was at the rock near the cave of Adullam, the Philistine
      army was camped in the valley of Rephaim. The Three (who were among the Thirty—an
      elite group among David’s fighting men) went down to meet him there. '
    16: "¹⁶ David was staying in the stronghold at the time, and a Philistine detachment\
      \ had occupied the town of Bethlehem. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ David remarked longingly to his men, “Oh, how I would love some of that
      good water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem.” '
    18: '¹⁸ So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew some water from
      the well by the gate in Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But David refused
      to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ “God forbid that I should drink this!” he exclaimed. “This water is as\
      \ precious as the blood of these men who risked their lives to bring it to me.”\
      \ So David did not drink it. These are examples of the exploits of the Three.\
      \ \n"
    20: '²⁰ Abishai, the brother of Joab, was the leader of the Thirty. He once used
      his spear to kill 300 enemy warriors in a single battle. It was by such feats
      that he became as famous as the Three. '
    21: "²¹ Abishai was the most famous of the Thirty and was their commander, though\
      \ he was not one of the Three. \n"
    22: '²² There was also Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant warrior from Kabzeel.
      He did many heroic deeds, which included killing two champions of Moab. Another
      time, on a snowy day, he chased a lion down into a pit and killed it. '
    23: '²³ Once, armed only with a club, he killed an Egyptian warrior who was 7
      1⁄2 feet tall and who was armed with a spear as thick as a weaver’s beam. Benaiah
      wrenched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with it. '
    24: '²⁴ Deeds like these made Benaiah as famous as the three mightiest warriors. '
    25: "²⁵ He was more honored than the other members of the Thirty, though he was\
      \ not one of the Three. And David made him captain of his bodyguard. \n"
    26: "²⁶ David’s mighty warriors also included:\nAsahel, Joab’s brother;\nElhanan\

  12:
    1: '¹ The following men joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul son
      of Kish. They were among the warriors who fought beside David in battle. '
    2: '² All of them were expert archers, and they could shoot arrows or sling stones
      with their left hand as well as their right. They were all relatives of Saul
      from the tribe of Benjamin. '
    3: "³ Their leader was Ahiezer son of Shemaah from Gibeah; his brother Joash was\

    8: "⁸ Some brave and experienced warriors from the tribe of Gad also defected\
      \ to David while he was at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were expert\
      \ with both shield and spear, as fierce as lions and as swift as deer on the\
      \ mountains. \n"
    9: "⁹ Ezer was their leader.\nObadiah was second.\nEliab was third.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Mishmannah was fourth.\nJeremiah was fifth.\n"

    13: "¹³ Jeremiah was tenth.\nMacbannai was eleventh. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ These warriors from Gad were army commanders. The weakest among them could
      take on a hundred regular troops, and the strongest could take on a thousand! '
    15: "¹⁵ These were the men who crossed the Jordan River during its seasonal flooding\
      \ at the beginning of the year and drove out all the people living in the lowlands\
      \ on both the east and west banks. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Others from Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. '
    17: "¹⁷ David went out to meet them and said, “If you have come in peace to help\
      \ me, we are friends. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I\
      \ am innocent, then may the God of our ancestors see it and punish you.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the leader of the Thirty, and he said,\n\

    19: "¹⁹ Some men from Manasseh defected from the Israelite army and joined David\

    20: '²⁰ Here is a list of the men from Manasseh who defected to David as he was

    21: '²¹ They helped David chase down bands of raiders, for they were all brave

    32: "³² From the tribe of Issachar, there were 200 leaders of the tribe with their\

      \ course for Israel to take. \n"
    33: "³³ From the tribe of Zebulun, there were 50,000 skilled warriors. They were\
      \ fully armed and prepared for battle and completely loyal to David. \n"
    34: "³⁴ From the tribe of Naphtali, there were 1,000 officers and 37,000 warriors\

    37: "³⁷ From the east side of the Jordan River—where the tribes of Reuben and\
      \ Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived—there were 120,000 troops armed with\
      \ every kind of weapon. \n"
    38: '³⁸ All these men came in battle array to Hebron with the single purpose of
      making David the king over all Israel. In fact, everyone in Israel agreed that
      David should be their king. '
    39: '³⁹ They feasted and drank with David for three days, for preparations had
      been made by their relatives for their arrival. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And people from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought
      food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. Vast supplies of flour, fig cakes,
      clusters of raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle, sheep, and goats were brought
      to the celebration. There was great joy throughout the land of Israel.
  13:
    1: '¹ David consulted with all his officials, including the generals and captains
      of his army. '
    2: '² Then he addressed the entire assembly of Israel as follows: “If you approve
      and if it is the will of the Lord our God, let us send messages to all the Israelites
      throughout the land, including the priests and Levites in their towns and pasturelands.
      Let us invite them to come and join us. '
    3: "³ It is time to bring back the Ark of our God, for we neglected it during\
      \ the reign of Saul.” \n"
    4: '⁴ The whole assembly agreed to this, for the people could see it was the right
      thing to do. '
    5: '⁵ So David summoned all Israel, from the Shihor Brook of Egypt in the south
      all the way to the town of Lebo-hamath in the north, to join in bringing the
      Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. '
    6: '⁶ Then David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (also called Kiriath-jearim)
      to bring back the Ark of God, which bears the name of the Lord who is enthroned
      between the cherubim. '
    7: '⁷ They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab’s
      house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart. '
    8: "⁸ David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, singing\
      \ songs and playing all kinds of musical instruments—lyres, harps, tambourines,\
      \ cymbals, and trumpets. \n"
    9: '⁹ But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled,
      and Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then the Lord’s anger was aroused against Uzzah, and he struck him dead\
      \ because he had laid his hand on the Ark. So Uzzah died there in the presence\
      \ of God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ David was angry because the Lord’s anger had burst out against Uzzah.\
      \ He named that place Perez-uzzah (which means “to burst out against Uzzah”),\
      \ as it is still called today. \n"
    12: '¹² David was now afraid of God, and he asked, “How can I ever bring the Ark
      of God back into my care?” '
    13: '¹³ So David did not move the Ark into the City of David. Instead, he took
      it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. '
    14: ¹⁴ The Ark of God remained there in Obed-edom’s house for three months, and
      the Lord blessed the household of Obed-edom and everything he owned.
  14:
    1: '¹ Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber,
      and stonemasons and carpenters to build him a palace. '
    2: "² And David realized that the Lord had confirmed him as king over Israel and\
      \ had greatly blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. \n"
    3: '³ Then David married more wives in Jerusalem, and they had more sons and daughters. '
    4: '⁴ These are the names of David’s sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shammua,
      Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, '
    5: '⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, '
    6: '⁶ Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, '
    7: "⁷ Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. \n"
    8: '⁸ When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel,
      they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were
      coming, so he marched out to meet them. '
    9: '⁹ The Philistines arrived and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. '
    10: "¹⁰ So David asked God, “Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you\
      \ hand them over to me?”\nThe Lord replied, “Yes, go ahead. I will hand them\
      \ over to you.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So David and his troops went up to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines
      there. “God did it!” David exclaimed. “He used me to burst through my enemies
      like a raging flood!” So they named that place Baal-perazim (which means “the
      Lord who bursts through”). '
    12: "¹² The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, so David gave orders to\
      \ burn them. \n"
    13: '¹³ But after a while the Philistines returned and raided the valley again. '
    14: '¹⁴ And once again David asked God what to do. “Do not attack them straight
      on,” God replied. “Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar
      trees. '
    15: '¹⁵ When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees,
      go out and attack! That will be the signal that God is moving ahead of you to
      strike down the Philistine army.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So David did what God commanded, and they struck down the Philistine army\
      \ all the way from Gibeon to Gezer. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So David’s fame spread everywhere, and the Lord caused all the nations
      to fear David.
  15:
    1: '¹ David now built several buildings for himself in the City of David. He also
      prepared a place for the Ark of God and set up a special tent for it. '
    2: "² Then he commanded, “No one except the Levites may carry the Ark of God.\
      \ The Lord has chosen them to carry the Ark of the Lord and to serve him forever.”\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then David summoned all Israel to Jerusalem to bring the Ark of the Lord
      to the place he had prepared for it. '
    4: "⁴ This is the number of the descendants of Aaron (the priests) and the Levites\
      \ who were called together: \n"
    5: "⁵ From the clan of Kohath, 120, with Uriel as their leader. \n"
    6: "⁶ From the clan of Merari, 220, with Asaiah as their leader. \n"
    7: "⁷ From the clan of Gershon, 130, with Joel as their leader. \n"
    8: "⁸ From the descendants of Elizaphan, 200, with Shemaiah as their leader. \n"
    9: "⁹ From the descendants of Hebron, 80, with Eliel as their leader. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ From the descendants of Uzziel, 112, with Amminadab as their leader. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David summoned the priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and these Levite
      leaders: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. '
    12: '¹² He said to them, “You are the leaders of the Levite families. You must
      purify yourselves and all your fellow Levites, so you can bring the Ark of the
      Lord, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it. '
    13: '¹³ Because you Levites did not carry the Ark the first time, the anger of
      the Lord our God burst out against us. We failed to ask God how to move it properly.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the priests and the Levites purified themselves in order to bring the
      Ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to Jerusalem. '
    15: "¹⁵ Then the Levites carried the Ark of God on their shoulders with its carrying\
      \ poles, just as the Lord had instructed Moses. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ David also ordered the Levite leaders to appoint a choir of Levites who
      were singers and musicians to sing joyful songs to the accompaniment of harps,
      lyres, and cymbals. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel along with his fellow Levites:
      Asaph son of Berekiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the clan of Merari. '
    18: "¹⁸ The following men were chosen as their assistants: Zechariah, Jaaziel,\
      \ Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu,\
      \ Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers—Obed-edom and Jeiel. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were chosen to sound the bronze
      cymbals. '
    20: '²⁰ Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah
      were chosen to play the harps. '
    21: '²¹ Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were chosen
      to play the lyres. '
    22: "²² Kenaniah, the head Levite, was chosen as the choir leader because of his\
      \ skill. \n"
    23: '²³ Berekiah and Elkanah were chosen to guard the Ark. '
    24: "²⁴ Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—all\
      \ of whom were priests—were chosen to blow the trumpets as they marched in front\
      \ of the Ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were chosen to guard the Ark. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Then David and the elders of Israel and the generals of the army went
      to the house of Obed-edom to bring the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant up to Jerusalem
      with a great celebration. '
    26: "²⁶ And because God was clearly helping the Levites as they carried the Ark\
      \ of the Lord’s Covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. \n"
    27: '²⁷ David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who
      carried the Ark, and also the singers, and Kenaniah the choir leader. David
      was also wearing a priestly garment. '
    28: "²⁸ So all Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant with shouts of\
      \ joy, the blowing of rams’ horns and trumpets, the crashing of cymbals, and\
      \ loud playing on harps and lyres. \n"
    29: ²⁹ But as the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant entered the City of David, Michal,
      the daughter of Saul, looked down from her window. When she saw King David skipping
      about and laughing with joy, she was filled with contempt for him.
  16:
    1: '¹ They brought the Ark of God and placed it inside the special tent David
      had prepared for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings
      to God. '
    2: '² When he had finished his sacrifices, David blessed the people in the name
      of the Lord. '
    3: "³ Then he gave to every man and woman in all Israel a loaf of bread, a cake\
      \ of dates, and a cake of raisins. \n"
    4: '⁴ David appointed the following Levites to lead the people in worship before
      the Ark of the Lord—to invoke his blessings, to give thanks, and to praise the
      Lord, the God of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Asaph, the leader of this group, sounded the cymbals. Second to him was
      Zechariah, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah,
      Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They played the harps and lyres. '
    6: "⁶ The priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, played the trumpets regularly before\
      \ the Ark of God’s Covenant. \n"
    7: "⁷ On that day David gave to Asaph and his fellow Levites this song of thanksgiving\
      \ to the Lord: \n"
    8: "⁸ Give thanks to the Lord and proclaim his greatness.\n    Let the whole world\
      \ know what he has done.\n"
    9: "⁹ Sing to him; yes, sing his praises.\n    Tell everyone about his wonderful\
      \ deeds.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Exult in his holy name;\n    rejoice, you who worship the Lord.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Search for the Lord and for his strength;\n    continually seek him.\n"
    12: "¹² Remember the wonders he has performed,\n    his miracles, and the rulings\
      \ he has given,\n"
    13: "¹³ you children of his servant Israel,\n    you descendants of Jacob, his\
      \ chosen ones. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God.\n    His justice is seen throughout the land.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Remember his covenant forever—\n    the commitment he made to a thousand\
      \ generations.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is the covenant he made with Abraham\n    and the oath he swore to\
      \ Isaac.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,\n    and to the people of Israel\
      \ as a never-ending covenant:\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I will give you the land of Canaan\n    as your special possession.”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ He said this when you were few in number,\n    a tiny group of strangers\
      \ in Canaan.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They wandered from nation to nation,\n    from one kingdom to another.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.\n    He warned kings on their\
      \ behalf:\n"
    22: "²² “Do not touch my chosen people,\n    and do not hurt my prophets.” \n"
    23: "²³ Let the whole earth sing to the Lord!\n    Each day proclaim the good\
      \ news that he saves.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Publish his glorious deeds among the nations.\n    Tell everyone about\
      \ the amazing things he does.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Great is the Lord! He is most worthy of praise!\n    He is to be feared\
      \ above all gods.\n"
    26: "²⁶ The gods of other nations are mere idols,\n    but the Lord made the heavens!\n"
    27: "²⁷ Honor and majesty surround him;\n    strength and joy fill his dwelling.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ O nations of the world, recognize the Lord,\n    recognize that the Lord\
      \ is glorious and strong.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Give to the Lord the glory he deserves!\n    Bring your offering and come\
      \ into his presence.\nWorship the Lord in all his holy splendor.\n"
    30: "³⁰     Let all the earth tremble before him.\n    The world stands firm and\
      \ cannot be shaken. \n"
    31: "³¹ Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice!\n    Tell all the nations,\
      \ “The Lord reigns!”\n"
    32: "³² Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!\n    Let the fields\
      \ and their crops burst out with joy!\n"
    33: "³³ Let the trees of the forest sing for joy before the Lord,\n    for he\
      \ is coming to judge the earth. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!\n    His faithful love endures\
      \ forever.\n"
    35: "³⁵ Cry out, “Save us, O God of our salvation!\n    Gather and rescue us from\
      \ among the nations,\nso we can thank your holy name\n    and rejoice and praise\
      \ you.” \n"
    36: "³⁶ Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    who lives from everlasting to\
      \ everlasting!\nAnd all the people shouted “Amen!” and praised the Lord. \n"
    37: '³⁷ David arranged for Asaph and his fellow Levites to serve regularly before
      the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, doing whatever needed to be done each day. '
    38: "³⁸ This group included Obed-edom (son of Jeduthun), Hosah, and sixty-eight\
      \ other Levites as gatekeepers. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Meanwhile, David stationed Zadok the priest and his fellow priests at
      the Tabernacle of the Lord at the place of worship in Gibeon, where they continued
      to minister before the Lord. '
    40: '⁴⁰ They sacrificed the regular burnt offerings to the Lord each morning and
      evening on the altar set aside for that purpose, obeying everything written
      in the Law of the Lord, as he had commanded Israel. '
    41: '⁴¹ David also appointed Heman, Jeduthun, and the others chosen by name to
      give thanks to the Lord, for “his faithful love endures forever.” '
    42: "⁴² They used their trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments to accompany\
      \ their songs of praise to God. And the sons of Jeduthun were appointed as gatekeepers.\
      \ \n"
    43: ⁴³ Then all the people returned to their homes, and David turned and went
      home to bless his own family.
  17:
    1: "¹ When David was settled in his palace, he summoned Nathan the prophet. “Look,”\
      \ David said, “I am living in a beautiful cedar palace, but the Ark of the Lord’s\
      \ Covenant is out there under a tent!” \n"
    2: "² Nathan replied to David, “Do whatever you have in mind, for God is with\
      \ you.” \n"
    3: "³ But that same night God said to Nathan, \n"
    4: '⁴ “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord has declared: You
      are not the one to build a house for me to live in. '
    5: '⁵ I have never lived in a house, from the day I brought the Israelites out
      of Egypt until this very day. My home has always been a tent, moving from one
      place to another in a Tabernacle. '
    6: "⁶ Yet no matter where I have gone with the Israelites, I have never once complained\
      \ to Israel’s leaders, the shepherds of my people. I have never asked them,\
      \ “Why haven’t you built me a beautiful cedar house?”’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Now go and say to my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord of Heaven’s
      Armies has declared: I took you from tending sheep in the pasture and selected
      you to be the leader of my people Israel. '
    8: '⁸ I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your
      enemies before your eyes. Now I will make your name as famous as anyone who
      has ever lived on the earth! '
    9: '⁹ And I will provide a homeland for my people Israel, planting them in a secure
      place where they will never be disturbed. Evil nations won’t oppress them as
      they’ve done in the past, '
    10: "¹⁰ starting from the time I appointed judges to rule my people Israel. And\
      \ I will defeat all your enemies.\n“‘Furthermore, I declare that the Lord will\
      \ build a house for you—a dynasty of kings! "
    11: '¹¹ For when you die and join your ancestors, I will raise up one of your
      descendants, one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong. '
    12: '¹² He is the one who will build a house—a temple—for me. And I will secure
      his throne forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my favor
      from him as I took it from the one who ruled before you. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will confirm him as king over my house and my kingdom for all time,\
      \ and his throne will be secure forever.’” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ So Nathan went back to David and told him everything the Lord had said\
      \ in this vision. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and prayed,\n“Who am I,\
      \ O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? "
    17: "¹⁷ And now, O God, in addition to everything else, you speak of giving your\
      \ servant a lasting dynasty! You speak as though I were someone very great,\
      \ O Lord God! \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “What more can I say to you about the way you have honored me? You know
      what your servant is really like. '
    19: "¹⁹ For the sake of your servant, O Lord, and according to your will, you\
      \ have done all these great things and have made them known. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “O Lord, there is no one like you. We have never even heard of another
      God like you! '
    21: '²¹ What other nation on earth is like your people Israel? What other nation,
      O God, have you redeemed from slavery to be your own people? You made a great
      name for yourself when you redeemed your people from Egypt. You performed awesome
      miracles and drove out the nations that stood in their way. '
    22: "²² You chose Israel to be your very own people forever, and you, O Lord,\
      \ became their God. \n"
    23: '²³ “And now, O Lord, I am your servant; do as you have promised concerning
      me and my family. May it be a promise that will last forever. '
    24: "²⁴ And may your name be established and honored forever so that everyone\
      \ will say, ‘The Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God!’\
      \ And may the house of your servant David continue before you forever. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “O my God, I have been bold enough to pray to you because you have revealed
      to your servant that you will build a house for him—a dynasty of kings! '
    26: '²⁶ For you are God, O Lord. And you have promised these good things to your
      servant. '
    27: ²⁷ And now, it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, so that
      it will continue forever before you. For when you grant a blessing, O Lord,
      it is an eternal blessing!”
  18:
    1: '¹ After this, David defeated and subdued the Philistines by conquering Gath
      and its surrounding towns. '
    2: "² David also conquered the land of Moab, and the Moabites who were spared\
      \ became David’s subjects and paid him tribute money. \n"
    3: '³ David also destroyed the forces of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, as far as Hamath,
      when Hadadezer marched out to strengthen his control along the Euphrates River. '
    4: "⁴ David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers, and 20,000 foot soldiers.\
      \ He crippled all the chariot horses except enough for 100 chariots. \n"
    5: '⁵ When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer, David killed
      22,000 of them. '
    6: "⁶ Then he placed several army garrisons in Damascus, the Aramean capital,\
      \ and the Arameans became David’s subjects and paid him tribute money. So the\
      \ Lord made David victorious wherever he went. \n"
    7: '⁷ David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer’s officers to Jerusalem, '
    8: "⁸ along with a large amount of bronze from Hadadezer’s towns of Tebah and\
      \ Cun. Later Solomon melted the bronze and molded it into the great bronze basin\
      \ called the Sea, the pillars, and the various bronze articles used at the Temple.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had destroyed the entire army of
      King Hadadezer of Zobah, '
    10: "¹⁰ he sent his son Joram to congratulate King David for his successful campaign.\
      \ Hadadezer and Toi had been enemies and were often at war. Joram presented\
      \ David with many gifts of gold, silver, and bronze. \n"
    11: "¹¹ King David dedicated all these gifts to the Lord, along with the silver\
      \ and gold he had taken from the other nations—from Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia,\
      \ and Amalek. \n"
    12: '¹² Abishai son of Zeruiah destroyed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. '
    13: "¹³ He placed army garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s\
      \ subjects. In fact, the Lord made David victorious wherever he went. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all
      his people. '
    15: '¹⁵ Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud
      was the royal historian. '
    16: '¹⁶ Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were the priests. Seraiah
      was the court secretary. '
    17: ¹⁷ Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard. And David’s
      sons served as the king’s chief assistants.
  19:
    1: '¹ Some time after this, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun
      became king. '
    2: "² David said, “I am going to show loyalty to Hanun because his father, Nahash,\
      \ was always loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express sympathy to Hanun\
      \ about his father’s death.\nBut when David’s ambassadors arrived in the land\
      \ of Ammon, "
    3: '³ the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you really think these men are
      coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the land
      so they can come in and conquer it!” '
    4: "⁴ So Hanun seized David’s ambassadors and shaved them, cut off their robes\
      \ at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame. \n"
    5: "⁵ When David heard what had happened to the men, he sent messengers to tell\
      \ them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back.” For\
      \ they felt deep shame because of their appearance. \n"
    6: '⁶ When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David,
      Hanun and the Ammonites sent 75,000 pounds of silver to hire chariots and charioteers
      from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. '
    7: '⁷ They also hired 32,000 chariots and secured the support of the king of Maacah
      and his army. These forces camped at Medeba, where they were joined by the Ammonite
      troops that Hanun had recruited from his own towns. '
    8: '⁸ When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight
      them. '
    9: "⁹ The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance\
      \ of the city, while the other kings positioned themselves to fight in the open\
      \ fields. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear,
      he chose some of Israel’s elite troops and placed them under his personal command
      to fight the Arameans in the fields. '
    11: '¹¹ He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai,
      who was to attack the Ammonites. '
    12: '¹² “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me,” Joab
      told his brother. “And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help
      you. '
    13: "¹³ Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our\
      \ God. May the Lord’s will be done.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away. '
    15: "¹⁵ And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they also ran from Abishai\
      \ and retreated into the city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel, so they\
      \ sent messengers and summoned additional Aramean troops from the other side\
      \ of the Euphrates River. These troops were under the command of Shobach, the\
      \ commander of Hadadezer’s forces. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed
      the Jordan River, and positioned his troops in battle formation. Then David
      engaged the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him. '
    18: '¹⁸ But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David’s forces
      killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, including Shobach, the commander
      of their army. '
    19: ¹⁹ When Hadadezer’s allies saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they
      surrendered to David and became his subjects. After that, the Arameans were
      no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
  20:
    1: "¹ In the spring of the year, when kings normally go out to war, Joab led the\
      \ Israelite army in successful attacks against the land of the Ammonites. In\
      \ the process he laid siege to the city of Rabbah, attacking and destroying\
      \ it. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem. \n"
    2: '² Then David went to Rabbah and removed the crown from the king’s head, and
      it was placed on his own head. The crown was made of gold and set with gems,
      and he found that it weighed seventy-five pounds. David took a vast amount of
      plunder from the city. '
    3: "³ He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with\
      \ saws, iron picks, and iron axes. That is how David dealt with the people of\
      \ all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. As they fought,\
      \ Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph, a descendant of the giants, and so the Philistines\
      \ were subdued. \n"
    5: "⁵ During another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi,\
      \ the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of Lahmi’s spear was as thick as\
      \ a weaver’s beam! \n"
    6: '⁶ In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge
      man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in
      all, who was also a descendant of the giants. '
    7: "⁷ But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son\
      \ of David’s brother Shimea. \n"
    8: ⁸ These Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his
      warriors killed them.
  21:
    1: '¹ Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people
      of Israel. '
    2: "² So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Take a census of\
      \ all the people of Israel—from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north—and\
      \ bring me a report so I may know how many there are.” \n"
    3: "³ But Joab replied, “May the Lord increase the number of his people a hundred\
      \ times over! But why, my lord the king, do you want to do this? Are they not\
      \ all your servants? Why must you cause Israel to sin?” \n"
    4: '⁴ But the king insisted that they take the census, so Joab traveled throughout
      all Israel to count the people. Then he returned to Jerusalem '
    5: '⁵ and reported the number of people to David. There were 1,100,000 warriors
      in all Israel who could handle a sword, and 470,000 in Judah. '
    6: "⁶ But Joab did not include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the census because\
      \ he was so distressed at what the king had made him do. \n"
    7: '⁷ God was very displeased with the census, and he punished Israel for it. '
    8: "⁸ Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by taking this census. Please\
      \ forgive my guilt for doing this foolish thing.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord spoke to Gad, David’s seer. This was the message: '
    10: "¹⁰ “Go and say to David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I will give you three\
      \ choices. Choose one of these punishments, and I will inflict it on you.’”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Gad came to David and said, “These are the choices the Lord has given
      you. '
    12: "¹² You may choose three years of famine, three months of destruction by the\
      \ sword of your enemies, or three days of severe plague as the angel of the\
      \ Lord brings devastation throughout the land of Israel. Decide what answer\
      \ I should give the Lord who sent me.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “I’m in a desperate situation!” David replied to Gad. “But let me fall\
      \ into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is very great. Do not let me fall\
      \ into human hands.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 people died as a result. '
    15: "¹⁵ And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But just as the angel was\
      \ preparing to destroy it, the Lord relented and said to the death angel, “Stop!\
      \ That is enough!” At that moment the angel of the Lord was standing by the\
      \ threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven
      and earth with his sword drawn, reaching out over Jerusalem. So David and the
      leaders of Israel put on burlap to show their deep distress and fell face down
      on the ground. '
    17: "¹⁷ And David said to God, “I am the one who called for the census! I am the\
      \ one who has sinned and done wrong! But these people are as innocent as sheep—what\
      \ have they done? O Lord my God, let your anger fall against me and my family,\
      \ but do not destroy your people.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the angel of the Lord told Gad to instruct David to go up and build
      an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. '
    19: '¹⁹ So David went up to do what the Lord had commanded him through Gad. '
    20: '²⁰ Araunah, who was busy threshing wheat at the time, turned and saw the
      angel there. His four sons, who were with him, ran away and hid. '
    21: "²¹ When Araunah saw David approaching, he left his threshing floor and bowed\
      \ before David with his face to the ground. \n"
    22: "²² David said to Araunah, “Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its\
      \ full price. Then I will build an altar to the Lord there, so that he will\
      \ stop the plague.” \n"
    23: "²³ “Take it, my lord the king, and use it as you wish,” Araunah said to David.\
      \ “I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, and the threshing boards for\
      \ wood to build a fire on the altar, and the wheat for the grain offering. I\
      \ will give it all to you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it for the
      full price. I will not take what is yours and give it to the Lord. I will not
      present burnt offerings that have cost me nothing!” '
    25: "²⁵ So David gave Araunah 600 pieces of gold in payment for the threshing\
      \ floor. \n"
    26: '²⁶ David built an altar there to the Lord and sacrificed burnt offerings
      and peace offerings. And when David prayed, the Lord answered him by sending
      fire from heaven to burn up the offering on the altar. '
    27: "²⁷ Then the Lord spoke to the angel, who put the sword back into its sheath.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ When David saw that the Lord had answered his prayer, he offered sacrifices
      there at Araunah’s threshing floor. '
    29: '²⁹ At that time the Tabernacle of the Lord and the altar of burnt offering
      that Moses had made in the wilderness were located at the place of worship in
      Gibeon. '
    30: ³⁰ But David was not able to go there to inquire of God, because he was terrified
      by the drawn sword of the angel of the Lord.
  22:
    1: "¹ Then David said, “This will be the location for the Temple of the Lord God\
      \ and the place of the altar for Israel’s burnt offerings!” \n"
    2: '² So David gave orders to call together the foreigners living in Israel, and
      he assigned them the task of preparing finished stone for building the Temple
      of God. '
    3: '³ David provided large amounts of iron for the nails that would be needed
      for the doors in the gates and for the clamps, and he gave more bronze than
      could be weighed. '
    4: "⁴ He also provided innumerable cedar logs, for the men of Tyre and Sidon had\
      \ brought vast amounts of cedar to David. \n"
    5: "⁵ David said, “My son Solomon is still young and inexperienced. And since\
      \ the Temple to be built for the Lord must be a magnificent structure, famous\
      \ and glorious throughout the world, I will begin making preparations for it\
      \ now.” So David collected vast amounts of building materials before his death.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then David sent for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a Temple
      for the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ “My son, I wanted to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord my God,”
      David told him. '
    8: '⁸ “But the Lord said to me, ‘You have killed many men in the battles you have
      fought. And since you have shed so much blood in my sight, you will not be the
      one to build a Temple to honor my name. '
    9: '⁹ But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I will give him peace
      with his enemies in all the surrounding lands. His name will be Solomon, and
      I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign. '
    10: "¹⁰ He is the one who will build a Temple to honor my name. He will be my\
      \ son, and I will be his father. And I will secure the throne of his kingdom\
      \ over Israel forever.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Now, my son, may the Lord be with you and give you success as you follow
      his directions in building the Temple of the Lord your God. '
    12: '¹² And may the Lord give you wisdom and understanding, that you may obey
      the Law of the Lord your God as you rule over Israel. '
    13: "¹³ For you will be successful if you carefully obey the decrees and regulations\
      \ that the Lord gave to Israel through Moses. Be strong and courageous; do not\
      \ be afraid or lose heart! \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “I have worked hard to provide materials for building the Temple of the
      Lord—nearly 4,000 tons of gold, 40,000 tons of silver, and so much iron and
      bronze that it cannot be weighed. I have also gathered timber and stone for
      the walls, though you may need to add more. '
    15: '¹⁵ You have a large number of skilled stonemasons and carpenters and craftsmen
      of every kind. '
    16: "¹⁶ You have expert goldsmiths and silversmiths and workers of bronze and\
      \ iron. Now begin the work, and may the Lord be with you!” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to assist Solomon in this
      project. '
    18: '¹⁸ “The Lord your God is with you,” he declared. “He has given you peace
      with the surrounding nations. He has handed them over to me, and they are now
      subject to the Lord and his people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Now seek the Lord your God with all your heart and soul. Build the sanctuary
      of the Lord God so that you can bring the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant and the
      holy vessels of God into the Temple built to honor the Lord’s name.”
  23:
    1: '¹ When David was an old man, he appointed his son Solomon to be king over
      Israel. '
    2: '² David summoned all the leaders of Israel, together with the priests and
      Levites. '
    3: '³ All the Levites who were thirty years old or older were counted, and the
      total came to 38,000. '
    4: '⁴ Then David said, “From all the Levites, 24,000 will supervise the work at
      the Temple of the Lord. Another 6,000 will serve as officials and judges. '
    5: '⁵ Another 4,000 will work as gatekeepers, and 4,000 will praise the Lord with
      the musical instruments I have made.” '
    6: "⁶ Then David divided the Levites into divisions named after the clans descended\
      \ from the three sons of Levi—Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    7: '⁷ The Gershonite family units were defined by their lines of descent from
      Libni and Shimei, the sons of Gershon. '
    8: '⁸ Three of the descendants of Libni were Jehiel (the family leader), Zetham,
      and Joel. '
    9: "⁹ These were the leaders of the family of Libni.\nThree of the descendants\
      \ of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. "
    10: '¹⁰ Four other descendants of Shimei were Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah. '
    11: "¹¹ Jahath was the family leader, and Ziza was next. Jeush and Beriah were\
      \ counted as a single family because neither had many sons. \n"
    12: "¹² Four of the descendants of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were\
      \ set apart to dedicate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices in the Lord’s\
      \ presence, to serve the Lord, and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ As for Moses, the man of God, his sons were included with the tribe of
      Levi. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer. '
    16: '¹⁶ The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel, the family leader. '
    17: "¹⁷ Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, the family leader. Rehabiah had numerous\
      \ descendants. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The descendants of Izhar included Shelomith, the family leader. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The descendants of Hebron included Jeriah (the family leader), Amariah\
      \ (the second), Jahaziel (the third), and Jekameam (the fourth). \n"
    20: "²⁰ The descendants of Uzziel included Micah (the family leader) and Isshiah\
      \ (the second). \n"
    21: "²¹ The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi.\nThe sons of Mahli\
      \ were Eleazar and Kish. "
    22: "²² Eleazar died with no sons, only daughters. His daughters married their\
      \ cousins, the sons of Kish. \n"
    23: "²³ Three of the descendants of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. \n"
    24: '²⁴ These were the descendants of Levi by clans, the leaders of their family
      groups, registered carefully by name. Each had to be twenty years old or older
      to qualify for service in the house of the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ For David said, “The Lord, the God of Israel, has given us peace, and
      he will always live in Jerusalem. '
    26: '²⁶ Now the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and its furnishings
      from place to place.” '
    27: "²⁷ In accordance with David’s final instructions, all the Levites twenty\
      \ years old or older were registered for service. \n"
    28: '²⁸ The work of the Levites was to assist the priests, the descendants of
      Aaron, as they served at the house of the Lord. They also took care of the courtyards
      and side rooms, helped perform the ceremonies of purification, and served in
      many other ways in the house of God. '
    29: '²⁹ They were in charge of the sacred bread that was set out on the table,
      the choice flour for the grain offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the
      cakes cooked in olive oil, and the other mixed breads. They were also responsible
      to check all the weights and measures. '
    30: '³⁰ And each morning and evening they stood before the Lord to sing songs
      of thanks and praise to him. '
    31: "³¹ They assisted with the burnt offerings that were presented to the Lord\
      \ on Sabbath days, at new moon celebrations, and at all the appointed festivals.\
      \ The required number of Levites served in the Lord’s presence at all times,\
      \ following all the procedures they had been given. \n"
    32: ³² And so, under the supervision of the priests, the Levites watched over
      the Tabernacle and the Temple and faithfully carried out their duties of service
      at the house of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ This is how Aaron’s descendants, the priests, were divided into groups for
      service. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    2: "² But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons. So only\
      \ Eleazar and Ithamar were left to carry on as priests. \n"
    3: '³ With the help of Zadok, who was a descendant of Eleazar, and of Ahimelech,
      who was a descendant of Ithamar, David divided Aaron’s descendants into groups
      according to their various duties. '
    4: "⁴ Eleazar’s descendants were divided into sixteen groups and Ithamar’s into\
      \ eight, for there were more family leaders among the descendants of Eleazar.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ All tasks were assigned to the various groups by means of sacred lots so
      that no preference would be shown, for there were many qualified officials serving
      God in the sanctuary from among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar. '
    6: "⁶ Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, acted as secretary and wrote down the\
      \ names and assignments in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the\
      \ priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the family leaders of the priests and\
      \ Levites. The descendants of Eleazar and Ithamar took turns casting lots. \n"
    7: "⁷ The first lot fell to Jehoiarib.\nThe second lot fell to Jedaiah.\n"
    8: "⁸ The third lot fell to Harim.\nThe fourth lot fell to Seorim.\n"
    9: "⁹ The fifth lot fell to Malkijah.\nThe sixth lot fell to Mijamin.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The seventh lot fell to Hakkoz.\nThe eighth lot fell to Abijah.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The ninth lot fell to Jeshua.\nThe tenth lot fell to Shecaniah.\n"
    12: "¹² The eleventh lot fell to Eliashib.\nThe twelfth lot fell to Jakim.\n"
    13: "¹³ The thirteenth lot fell to Huppah.\nThe fourteenth lot fell to Jeshebeab.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The fifteenth lot fell to Bilgah.\nThe sixteenth lot fell to Immer.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The seventeenth lot fell to Hezir.\nThe eighteenth lot fell to Happizzez.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The nineteenth lot fell to Pethahiah.\nThe twentieth lot fell to Jehezkel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The twenty-first lot fell to Jakin.\nThe twenty-second lot fell to Gamul.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The twenty-third lot fell to Delaiah.\nThe twenty-fourth lot fell to Maaziah.\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Each group carried out its appointed duties in the house of the Lord according\
      \ to the procedures established by their ancestor Aaron in obedience to the\
      \ commands of the Lord, the God of Israel. \n"
    20: "²⁰ These were the other family leaders descended from Levi:\nFrom the descendants\
      \ of Amram, the leader was Shebuel.\nFrom the descendants of Shebuel, the leader\
      \ was Jehdeiah.\n"
    21: "²¹ From the descendants of Rehabiah, the leader was Isshiah.\n"
    22: "²² From the descendants of Izhar, the leader was Shelomith.\nFrom the descendants\
      \ of Shelomith, the leader was Jahath.\n"
    23: "²³ From the descendants of Hebron, Jeriah was the leader, Amariah was second,\
      \ Jahaziel was third, and Jekameam was fourth.\n"
    24: "²⁴ From the descendants of Uzziel, the leader was Micah.\nFrom the descendants\
      \ of Micah, the leader was Shamir, "
    25: "²⁵ along with Isshiah, the brother of Micah.\nFrom the descendants of Isshiah,\
      \ the leader was Zechariah.\n"
    26: "²⁶ From the descendants of Merari, the leaders were Mahli and Mushi.\nFrom\
      \ the descendants of Jaaziah, the leader was Beno.\n"
    27: "²⁷ From the descendants of Merari through Jaaziah, the leaders were Beno,\
      \ Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.\n"
    28: "²⁸ From the descendants of Mahli, the leader was Eleazar, though he had no\
      \ sons.\n"
    29: "²⁹ From the descendants of Kish, the leader was Jerahmeel.\n"
    30: "³⁰ From the descendants of Mushi, the leaders were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.\n\
      These were the descendants of Levi in their various families. "
    31: ³¹ Like the descendants of Aaron, they were assigned to their duties by means
      of sacred lots, without regard to age or rank. Lots were drawn in the presence
      of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the family leaders of the priests and the
      Levites.
  25:
    1: "¹ David and the army commanders then appointed men from the families of Asaph,\
      \ Heman, and Jeduthun to proclaim God’s messages to the accompaniment of lyres,\
      \ harps, and cymbals. Here is a list of their names and their work: \n"
    2: "² From the sons of Asaph, there were Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah.\
      \ They worked under the direction of their father, Asaph, who proclaimed God’s\

    3: "³ From the sons of Jeduthun, there were Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei,\

    5: "⁵ All these were the sons of Heman, the king’s seer, for God had honored him\
      \ with fourteen sons and three daughters. \n"
    6: '⁶ All these men were under the direction of their fathers as they made music
      at the house of the Lord. Their responsibilities included the playing of cymbals,
      harps, and lyres at the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman reported directly
      to the king. '
    7: '⁷ They and their families were all trained in making music before the Lord,
      and each of them—288 in all—was an accomplished musician. '
    8: "⁸ The musicians were appointed to their term of service by means of sacred\
      \ lots, without regard to whether they were young or old, teacher or student.\

    2: '² David rose to his feet and said: “My brothers and my people! It was my desire
      to build a Temple where the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, God’s footstool, could
      rest permanently. I made the necessary preparations for building it, '
    3: "³ but God said to me, ‘You must not build a Temple to honor my name, for you\
      \ are a warrior and have shed much blood.’ \n"
    4: '⁴ “Yet the Lord, the God of Israel, has chosen me from among all my father’s
      family to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen the tribe of Judah
      to rule, and from among the families of Judah he chose my father’s family. And
      from among my father’s sons the Lord was pleased to make me king over all Israel. '
    5: '⁵ And from among my sons—for the Lord has given me many—he chose Solomon to
      succeed me on the throne of Israel and to rule over the Lord’s kingdom. '
    6: '⁶ He said to me, ‘Your son Solomon will build my Temple and its courtyards,
      for I have chosen him as my son, and I will be his father. '
    7: "⁷ And if he continues to obey my commands and regulations as he does now,\

      \ it to your children as a permanent inheritance. \n"
    9: '⁹ “And Solomon, my son, learn to know the God of your ancestors intimately.
      Worship and serve him with your whole heart and a willing mind. For the Lord
      sees every heart and knows every plan and thought. If you seek him, you will
      find him. But if you forsake him, he will reject you forever. '
    10: "¹⁰ So take this seriously. The Lord has chosen you to build a Temple as his\

    11: '¹¹ Then David gave Solomon the plans for the Temple and its surroundings,
      including the entry room, the storerooms, the upstairs rooms, the inner rooms,
      and the inner sanctuary—which was the place of atonement. '

      gifts dedicated to the Lord. '
    13: "¹³ The king also gave Solomon the instructions concerning the work of the\

      \ gave specifications for the items in the Temple that were to be used for worship.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ David gave instructions regarding how much gold and silver should be used
      to make the items needed for service. '
    15: '¹⁵ He told Solomon the amount of gold needed for the gold lampstands and
      lamps, and the amount of silver for the silver lampstands and lamps, depending
      on how each would be used. '
    16: "¹⁶ He designated the amount of gold for the table on which the Bread of the\
      \ Presence would be placed and the amount of silver for other tables. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ David also designated the amount of gold for the solid gold meat hooks
      used to handle the sacrificial meat and for the basins, pitchers, and dishes,
      as well as the amount of silver for every dish. '
    18: '¹⁸ He designated the amount of refined gold for the altar of incense. Finally,
      he gave him a plan for the Lord’s “chariot”—the gold cherubim whose wings were
      stretched out over the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant. '
    19: "¹⁹ “Every part of this plan,” David told Solomon, “was given to me in writing\
      \ from the hand of the Lord.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then David continued, “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Don’t
      be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not
      fail you or forsake you. He will see to it that all the work related to the
      Temple of the Lord is finished correctly. '
    21: ²¹ The various divisions of priests and Levites will serve in the Temple of
      God. Others with skills of every kind will volunteer, and the officials and
      the entire nation are at your command.”
  29:
    1: '¹ Then King David turned to the entire assembly and said, “My son Solomon,
      whom God has clearly chosen as the next king of Israel, is still young and inexperienced.
      The work ahead of him is enormous, for the Temple he will build is not for mere
      mortals—it is for the Lord God himself! '
    2: "² Using every resource at my command, I have gathered as much as I could for\
      \ building the Temple of my God. Now there is enough gold, silver, bronze, iron,\
      \ and wood, as well as great quantities of onyx, other precious stones, costly\
      \ jewels, and all kinds of fine stone and marble. \n"
    3: '³ “And now, because of my devotion to the Temple of my God, I am giving all
      of my own private treasures of gold and silver to help in the construction.
      This is in addition to the building materials I have already collected for his
      holy Temple. '
    4: '⁴ I am donating more than 112 tons of gold from Ophir and 262 tons of refined
      silver to be used for overlaying the walls of the buildings '
    5: "⁵ and for the other gold and silver work to be done by the craftsmen. Now\
      \ then, who will follow my example and give offerings to the Lord today?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the family leaders, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the generals
      and captains of the army, and the king’s administrative officers all gave willingly. '
    7: '⁷ For the construction of the Temple of God, they gave about 188 tons of gold,
      10,000 gold coins, 375 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 3,750 tons of
      iron. '
    8: '⁸ They also contributed numerous precious stones, which were deposited in
      the treasury of the house of the Lord under the care of Jehiel, a descendant
      of Gershon. '
    9: "⁹ The people rejoiced over the offerings, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly\
      \ to the Lord, and King David was filled with joy. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly:\n“O\
      \ Lord, the God of our ancestor Israel, may you be praised forever and ever! "
    11: '¹¹ Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and
      the majesty. Everything in the heavens and on earth is yours, O Lord, and this
      is your kingdom. We adore you as the one who is over all things. '
    12: "¹² Wealth and honor come from you alone, for you rule over everything. Power\
      \ and might are in your hand, and at your discretion people are made great and\
      \ given strength. \n"
    13: '¹³ “O our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name! '
    14: '¹⁴ But who am I, and who are my people, that we could give anything to you?
      Everything we have has come from you, and we give you only what you first gave
      us! '
    15: "¹⁵ We are here for only a moment, visitors and strangers in the land as our\
      \ ancestors were before us. Our days on earth are like a passing shadow, gone\
      \ so soon without a trace. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “O Lord our God, even this material we have gathered to build a Temple
      to honor your holy name comes from you! It all belongs to you! '
    17: "¹⁷ I know, my God, that you examine our hearts and rejoice when you find\
      \ integrity there. You know I have done all this with good motives, and I have\
      \ watched your people offer their gifts willingly and joyously. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “O Lord, the God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, make your
      people always want to obey you. See to it that their love for you never changes. '
    19: "¹⁹ Give my son Solomon the wholehearted desire to obey all your commands,\
      \ laws, and decrees, and to do everything necessary to build this Temple, for\
      \ which I have made these preparations.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then David said to the whole assembly, “Give praise to the Lord your God!”\
      \ And the entire assembly praised the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and\
      \ they bowed low and knelt before the Lord and the king. \n"
    21: '²¹ The next day they brought 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 male lambs
      as burnt offerings to the Lord. They also brought liquid offerings and many
      other sacrifices on behalf of all Israel. '
    22: "²² They feasted and drank in the Lord’s presence with great joy that day.\n\
      And again they crowned David’s son Solomon as their new king. They anointed\
      \ him before the Lord as their leader, and they anointed Zadok as priest. "
    23: '²³ So Solomon took the throne of the Lord in place of his father, David,
      and he succeeded in everything, and all Israel obeyed him. '
    24: '²⁴ All the officials, the warriors, and the sons of King David pledged their
      loyalty to King Solomon. '
    25: "²⁵ And the Lord exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and he gave Solomon\
      \ greater royal splendor than any king in Israel before him. \n"
    26: '²⁶ So David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. '
    27: '²⁷ He reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three
      in Jerusalem. '
    28: "²⁸ He died at a ripe old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth, and honor.\
      \ Then his son Solomon ruled in his place. \n"
    29: '²⁹ All the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, are written
      in The Record of Samuel the Seer, The Record of Nathan the Prophet, and The
      Record of Gad the Seer. '
    30: ³⁰ These accounts include the mighty deeds of his reign and everything that
      happened to him and to Israel and to all the surrounding kingdoms.
