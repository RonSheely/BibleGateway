Joel:
  1:
    1: "¹ The Lord gave this message to Joel son of Pethuel. \n"
    2: "² Hear this, you leaders of the people.\n    Listen, all who live in the land.\n\
      In all your history,\n    has anything like this happened before?\n"
    3: "³ Tell your children about it in the years to come,\n    and let your children\
      \ tell their children.\n    Pass the story down from generation to generation.\n"
    4: "⁴ After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops,\n    the swarming locusts\
      \ took what was left!\nAfter them came the hopping locusts,\n    and then the\
      \ stripping locusts, too! \n"
    5: "⁵ Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!\n    Wail, all you wine-drinkers!\nAll\
      \ the grapes are ruined,\n    and all your sweet wine is gone.\n"
    6: "⁶ A vast army of locusts has invaded my land,\n    a terrible army too numerous\
      \ to count.\nIts teeth are like lions’ teeth,\n    its fangs like those of a\
      \ lioness.\n"
    7: "⁷ It has destroyed my grapevines\n    and ruined my fig trees,\nstripping\
      \ their bark and destroying it,\n    leaving the branches white and bare. \n"
    8: "⁸ Weep like a bride dressed in black,\n    mourning the death of her husband.\n"
    9: "⁹ For there is no grain or wine\n    to offer at the Temple of the Lord.\n\
      So the priests are in mourning.\n    The ministers of the Lord are weeping.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The fields are ruined,\n    the land is stripped bare.\nThe grain is destroyed,\n\
      \    the grapes have shriveled,\n    and the olive oil is gone. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Despair, all you farmers!\n    Wail, all you vine growers!\nWeep, because\
      \ the wheat and barley—\n    all the crops of the field—are ruined.\n"
    12: "¹² The grapevines have dried up,\n    and the fig trees have withered.\n\
      The pomegranate trees, palm trees, and apple trees—\n    all the fruit trees—have\
      \ dried up.\n    And the people’s joy has dried up with them. \n"
    13: "¹³ Dress yourselves in burlap and weep, you priests!\n    Wail, you who serve\
      \ before the altar!\nCome, spend the night in burlap,\n    you ministers of\
      \ my God.\nFor there is no grain or wine\n    to offer at the Temple of your\
      \ God.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Announce a time of fasting;\n    call the people together for a solemn\
      \ meeting.\nBring the leaders\n    and all the people of the land\ninto the\
      \ Temple of the Lord your God,\n    and cry out to him there.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The day of the Lord is near,\n    the day when destruction comes from\
      \ the Almighty.\n    How terrible that day will be! \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Our food disappears before our very eyes.\n    No joyful celebrations\
      \ are held in the house of our God.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seeds die in the parched ground,\n    and the grain crops fail.\n\
      The barns stand empty,\n    and granaries are abandoned.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ How the animals moan with hunger!\n    The herds of cattle wander about\
      \ confused,\nbecause they have no pasture.\n    The flocks of sheep and goats\
      \ bleat in misery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Lord, help us!\nThe fire has consumed the wilderness pastures,\n    and\
      \ flames have burned up all the trees.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Even the wild animals cry out to you\n    because the streams have dried\
      \ up,\n    and fire has consumed the wilderness pastures."
  2:
    1: "¹ Sound the trumpet in Jerusalem!\n    Raise the alarm on my holy mountain!\n\
      Let everyone tremble in fear\n    because the day of the Lord is upon us.\n"
    2: "² It is a day of darkness and gloom,\n    a day of thick clouds and deep blackness.\n\
      Suddenly, like dawn spreading across the mountains,\n    a great and mighty\
      \ army appears.\nNothing like it has been seen before\n    or will ever be seen\
      \ again. \n"
    3: "³ Fire burns in front of them,\n    and flames follow after them.\nAhead of\
      \ them the land lies\n    as beautiful as the Garden of Eden.\nBehind them is\
      \ nothing but desolation;\n    not one thing escapes.\n"
    4: "⁴ They look like horses;\n    they charge forward like warhorses.\n"
    5: "⁵ Look at them as they leap along the mountaintops.\n    Listen to the noise\
      \ they make—like the rumbling of chariots,\nlike the roar of fire sweeping across\
      \ a field of stubble,\n    or like a mighty army moving into battle. \n"
    6: "⁶ Fear grips all the people;\n    every face grows pale with terror.\n"
    7: "⁷ The attackers march like warriors\n    and scale city walls like soldiers.\n\
      Straight forward they march,\n    never breaking rank.\n"
    8: "⁸ They never jostle each other;\n    each moves in exactly the right position.\n\
      They break through defenses\n    without missing a step.\n"
    9: "⁹ They swarm over the city\n    and run along its walls.\nThey enter all the\
      \ houses,\n    climbing like thieves through the windows.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The earth quakes as they advance,\n    and the heavens tremble.\nThe sun\
      \ and moon grow dark,\n    and the stars no longer shine. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord is at the head of the column.\n    He leads them with a shout.\n\
      This is his mighty army,\n    and they follow his orders.\nThe day of the Lord\
      \ is an awesome, terrible thing.\n    Who can possibly survive? \n"
    12: "¹² That is why the Lord says,\n    “Turn to me now, while there is time.\n\
      Give me your hearts.\n    Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning.\n"
    13: "¹³ Don’t tear your clothing in your grief,\n    but tear your hearts instead.”\n\
      Return to the Lord your God,\n    for he is merciful and compassionate,\nslow\
      \ to get angry and filled with unfailing love.\n    He is eager to relent and\
      \ not punish.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who knows? Perhaps he will give you a reprieve,\n    sending you a blessing\
      \ instead of this curse.\nPerhaps you will be able to offer grain and wine\n\
      \    to the Lord your God as before. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Blow the ram’s horn in Jerusalem!\n    Announce a time of fasting;\ncall\
      \ the people together\n    for a solemn meeting.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Gather all the people—\n    the elders, the children, and even the babies.\n\
      Call the bridegroom from his quarters\n    and the bride from her private room.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let the priests, who minister in the Lord’s presence,\n    stand and weep\
      \ between the entry room to the Temple and the altar.\nLet them pray, “Spare\
      \ your people, Lord!\n    Don’t let your special possession become an object\
      \ of mockery.\nDon’t let them become a joke for unbelieving foreigners who say,\n\
      \    ‘Has the God of Israel left them?’” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Lord will pity his people\n    and jealously guard the honor\
      \ of his land.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord will reply,\n“Look! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive\
      \ oil,\n    enough to satisfy your needs.\nYou will no longer be an object of\
      \ mockery\n    among the surrounding nations.\n"
    20: "²⁰ I will drive away these armies from the north.\n    I will send them into\
      \ the parched wastelands.\nThose in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea,\n\
      \    and those at the rear into the Mediterranean.\nThe stench of their rotting\
      \ bodies will rise over the land.”\nSurely the Lord has done great things!\n"
    21: "²¹     Don’t be afraid, O land.\nBe glad now and rejoice,\n    for the Lord\
      \ has done great things.\n"
    22: "²² Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field,\n    for the wilderness pastures\
      \ will soon be green.\nThe trees will again be filled with fruit;\n    fig trees\
      \ and grapevines will be loaded down once more.\n"
    23: "²³ Rejoice, you people of Jerusalem!\n    Rejoice in the Lord your God!\n\
      For the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness.\n    Once more the autumn\
      \ rains will come,\n    as well as the rains of spring.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The threshing floors will again be piled high with grain,\n    and the\
      \ presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil. \n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord says, “I will give you back what you lost\n    to the swarming\
      \ locusts, the hopping locusts,\nthe stripping locusts, and the cutting locusts.\n\
      \    It was I who sent this great destroying army against you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Once again you will have all the food you want,\n    and you will praise\
      \ the Lord your God,\nwho does these miracles for you.\n    Never again will\
      \ my people be disgraced.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Then you will know that I am among my people Israel,\n    that I am the\
      \ Lord your God, and there is no other.\n    Never again will my people be disgraced.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “Then, after doing all those things,\n    I will pour out my Spirit upon\
      \ all people.\nYour sons and daughters will prophesy.\n    Your old men will\
      \ dream dreams,\n    and your young men will see visions.\n"
    29: "²⁹ In those days I will pour out my Spirit\n    even on servants—men and\
      \ women alike.\n"
    30: "³⁰ And I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth—\n    blood and\
      \ fire and columns of smoke.\n"
    31: "³¹ The sun will become dark,\n    and the moon will turn blood red\n    before\
      \ that great and terrible day of the Lord arrives.\n"
    32: "³² But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord\n    will be saved,\nfor\
      \ some on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will escape,\n    just as the Lord has said.\n\
      These will be among the survivors\n    whom the Lord has called."
  3:
    1: "¹ “At the time of those events,” says the Lord,\n    “when I restore the prosperity\
      \ of Judah and Jerusalem,\n"
    2: "² I will gather the armies of the world\n    into the valley of Jehoshaphat.\n\
      There I will judge them\n    for harming my people, my special possession,\n\
      for scattering my people among the nations,\n    and for dividing up my land.\n"
    3: "³ They threw dice to decide which of my people\n    would be their slaves.\n\
      They traded boys to obtain prostitutes\n    and sold girls for enough wine to\
      \ get drunk. \n"
    4: '⁴ “What do you have against me, Tyre and Sidon and you cities of Philistia?
      Are you trying to take revenge on me? If you are, then watch out! I will strike
      swiftly and pay you back for everything you have done. '
    5: '⁵ You have taken my silver and gold and all my precious treasures, and have
      carried them off to your pagan temples. '
    6: "⁶ You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, so they could\
      \ take them far from their homeland. \n"
    7: '⁷ “But I will bring them back from all the places to which you sold them,
      and I will pay you back for everything you have done. '
    8: "⁸ I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will\
      \ sell them to the people of Arabia, a nation far away. I, the Lord, have spoken!”\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Say to the nations far and wide:\n    “Get ready for war!\nCall out your\
      \ best warriors.\n    Let all your fighting men advance for the attack.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hammer your plowshares into swords\n    and your pruning hooks into spears.\n\
      \    Train even your weaklings to be warriors.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Come quickly, all you nations everywhere.\n    Gather together in the\
      \ valley.”\nAnd now, O Lord, call out your warriors! \n"
    12: "¹² “Let the nations be called to arms.\n    Let them march to the valley\
      \ of Jehoshaphat.\nThere I, the Lord, will sit\n    to pronounce judgment on\
      \ them all.\n"
    13: "¹³ Swing the sickle,\n    for the harvest is ripe.\nCome, tread the grapes,\n\
      \    for the winepress is full.\nThe storage vats are overflowing\n    with\
      \ the wickedness of these people.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Thousands upon thousands are waiting in the valley of decision.\n    There\
      \ the day of the Lord will soon arrive.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sun and moon will grow dark,\n    and the stars will no longer shine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord’s voice will roar from Zion\n    and thunder from Jerusalem,\n\
      \    and the heavens and the earth will shake.\nBut the Lord will be a refuge\
      \ for his people,\n    a strong fortress for the people of Israel. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Then you will know that I, the Lord your God,\n    live in Zion, my holy\
      \ mountain.\nJerusalem will be holy forever,\n    and foreign armies will never\
      \ conquer her again.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,\n    and the hills\
      \ will flow with milk.\nWater will fill the streambeds of Judah,\n    and a\
      \ fountain will burst forth from the Lord’s Temple,\n    watering the arid valley\
      \ of acacias.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ But Egypt will become a wasteland\n    and Edom will become a wilderness,\n\
      because they attacked the people of Judah\n    and killed innocent people in\
      \ their land. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “But Judah will be filled with people forever,\n    and Jerusalem will\
      \ endure through all generations.\n"
    21: "²¹ I will pardon my people’s crimes,\n    which I have not yet pardoned;\n\
      and I, the Lord, will make my home\n    in Jerusalem with my people.”"
