    2: "² Then you will show discernment,\n    and your lips will express what you’ve\
      \ learned.\n"
    3: "³ For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey,\n    and her mouth\
      \ is smoother than oil.\n"
    4: "⁴ But in the end she is as bitter as poison,\n    as dangerous as a double-edged\
      \ sword.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her feet go down to death;\n    her steps lead straight to the grave.\n"
    6: "⁶ For she cares nothing about the path to life.\n    She staggers down a crooked\
      \ trail and doesn’t realize it. \n"
    7: "⁷ So now, my sons, listen to me.\n    Never stray from what I am about to\
      \ say:\n"
    8: "⁸ Stay away from her!\n    Don’t go near the door of her house!\n"

    12: "¹² You will say, “How I hated discipline!\n    If only I had not ignored\
      \ all the warnings!\n"
    13: "¹³ Oh, why didn’t I listen to my teachers?\n    Why didn’t I pay attention\
      \ to my instructors?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have come to the brink of utter ruin,\n    and now I must face public\
      \ disgrace.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Drink water from your own well—\n    share your love only with your wife.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Why spill the water of your springs in the streets,\n    having sex with\
      \ just anyone?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ You should reserve it for yourselves.\n    Never share it with strangers.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you.\n    Rejoice in the wife\
      \ of your youth.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ She is a loving deer, a graceful doe.\n    Let her breasts satisfy you\
      \ always.\n    May you always be captivated by her love.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Why be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman,\n    or fondle the breasts\
      \ of a promiscuous woman? \n"
    21: "²¹ For the Lord sees clearly what a man does,\n    examining every path he\
      \ takes.\n"
    22: "²² An evil man is held captive by his own sins;\n    they are ropes that\
      \ catch and hold him.\n"
    23: "²³ He will die for lack of self-control;\n    he will be lost because of\
      \ his great foolishness."
  6:
    1: "¹ My child, if you have put up security for a friend’s debt\n    or agreed\
      \ to guarantee the debt of a stranger—\n"
    2: "² if you have trapped yourself by your agreement\n    and are caught by what\
      \ you said—\n"
    3: "³ follow my advice and save yourself,\n    for you have placed yourself at\
      \ your friend’s mercy.\nNow swallow your pride;\n    go and beg to have your\
      \ name erased.\n"
    4: "⁴ Don’t put it off; do it now!\n    Don’t rest until you do.\n"
    5: "⁵ Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter,\n    like a bird fleeing\
      \ from a net. \n"
    6: "⁶ Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones.\n    Learn from their ways and\
      \ become wise!\n"
    7: "⁷ Though they have no prince\n    or governor or ruler to make them work,\n"
    8: "⁸ they labor hard all summer,\n    gathering food for the winter.\n"
    9: "⁹ But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep?\n    When will you wake up?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,\n    a little folding of\
      \ the hands to rest—\n"
    11: "¹¹ then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;\n    scarcity will attack\
      \ you like an armed robber. \n"
    12: "¹² What are worthless and wicked people like?\n    They are constant liars,\n"
    13: "¹³ signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye,\n    a nudge of the foot,\
      \ or the wiggle of fingers.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Their perverted hearts plot evil,\n    and they constantly stir up trouble.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But they will be destroyed suddenly,\n    broken in an instant beyond\
      \ all hope of healing. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ There are six things the Lord hates—\n    no, seven things he detests:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ haughty eyes,\n    a lying tongue,\n    hands that kill the innocent,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ a heart that plots evil,\n    feet that race to do wrong,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ a false witness who pours out lies,\n    a person who sows discord in\
      \ a family. \n"
    20: "²⁰ My son, obey your father’s commands,\n    and don’t neglect your mother’s\
      \ instruction.\n"
    21: "²¹ Keep their words always in your heart.\n    Tie them around your neck.\n"
    22: "²² When you walk, their counsel will lead you.\n    When you sleep, they\
      \ will protect you.\n    When you wake up, they will advise you.\n"
    23: "²³ For their command is a lamp\n    and their instruction a light;\ntheir\
      \ corrective discipline\n    is the way to life.\n"
    24: "²⁴ It will keep you from the immoral woman,\n    from the smooth tongue of\
      \ a promiscuous woman.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Don’t lust for her beauty.\n    Don’t let her coy glances seduce you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For a prostitute will bring you to poverty,\n    but sleeping with another\
      \ man’s wife will cost you your life.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Can a man scoop a flame into his lap\n    and not have his clothes catch\
      \ on fire?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Can he walk on hot coals\n    and not blister his feet?\n"
    29: "²⁹ So it is with the man who sleeps with another man’s wife.\n    He who\
      \ embraces her will not go unpunished. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Excuses might be found for a thief\n    who steals because he is starving.\n"
    31: "³¹ But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole,\n   \
      \ even if he has to sell everything in his house.\n"
    32: "³² But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool,\n    for he destroys\
      \ himself.\n"
    33: "³³ He will be wounded and disgraced.\n    His shame will never be erased.\n"
    34: "³⁴ For the woman’s jealous husband will be furious,\n    and he will show\
      \ no mercy when he takes revenge.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He will accept no compensation,\n    nor be satisfied with a payoff of\
      \ any size."

    7: "⁷ I saw some naive young men,\n    and one in particular who lacked common\
      \ sense.\n"
    8: "⁸ He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman,\n    strolling\
      \ down the path by her house.\n"

    13: "¹³ She threw her arms around him and kissed him,\n    and with a brazen look\
      \ she said,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I’ve just made my peace offerings\n    and fulfilled my vows.\n"
