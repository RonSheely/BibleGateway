2 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ This letter is from John, the elder.\nI am writing to the chosen lady and\
      \ to her children, whom I love in the truth—as does everyone else who knows\
      \ the truth— "
    2: "² because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever. \n"
    3: "³ Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ—the\
      \ Son of the Father—will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according\
      \ to the truth, just as the Father commanded. \n"
    5: '⁵ I am writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another.
      This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning. '
    6: "⁶ Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love\
      \ one another, just as you heard from the beginning. \n"
    7: '⁷ I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny
      that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist. '
    8: '⁸ Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked so hard to achieve. Be
      diligent so that you receive your full reward. '
    9: "⁹ Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God.\
      \ But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both\
      \ the Father and the Son. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ If anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ,
      don’t invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement. '
    11: "¹¹ Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to do it with paper and\
      \ ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our\
      \ joy will be complete. \n"
    13: ¹³ Greetings from the children of your sister, chosen by God.
