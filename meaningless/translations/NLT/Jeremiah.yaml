Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests from
      the town of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. '
    2: '² The Lord first gave messages to Jeremiah during the thirteenth year of the
      reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah. '
    3: "³ The Lord’s messages continued throughout the reign of King Jehoiakim, Josiah’s\
      \ son, until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah, another of Josiah’s\
      \ sons. In August of that eleventh year the people of Jerusalem were taken away\
      \ as captives. \n"
    4: "⁴ The Lord gave me this message: \n"
    5: "⁵ “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb.\n    Before you were\
      \ born I set you apart\n    and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.”\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ “O Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I can’t speak for you! I’m too young!” \n"
    7: '⁷ The Lord replied, “Don’t say, ‘I’m too young,’ for you must go wherever
      I send you and say whatever I tell you. '
    8: '⁸ And don’t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect
      you. I, the Lord, have spoken!” '
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth and said,\n“Look, I have\
      \ put my words in your mouth!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Today I appoint you to stand up\n    against nations and kingdoms.\nSome\
      \ you must uproot and tear down,\n    destroy and overthrow.\nOthers you must\
      \ build up\n    and plant.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Look, Jeremiah! What do you see?”\nAnd I replied,\
      \ “I see a branch from an almond tree.” \n"
    12: "¹² And the Lord said, “That’s right, and it means that I am watching, and\
      \ I will certainly carry out all my plans.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Then the Lord spoke to me again and asked, “What do you see now?”\nAnd\
      \ I replied, “I see a pot of boiling water, spilling from the north.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Yes,” the Lord said, “for terror from the north will boil out on the
      people of this land. '
    15: "¹⁵ Listen! I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to\
      \ Jerusalem. I, the Lord, have spoken!\n“They will set their thrones\n    at\
      \ the gates of the city.\nThey will attack its walls\n    and all the other\
      \ towns of Judah.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I will pronounce judgment\n    on my people for all their evil—\nfor deserting\
      \ me and burning incense to other gods.\n    Yes, they worship idols made with\
      \ their own hands! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Get up and prepare for action.\n    Go out and tell them everything I\
      \ tell you to say.\nDo not be afraid of them,\n    or I will make you look foolish\
      \ in front of them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For see, today I have made you strong\n    like a fortified city that\
      \ cannot be captured,\n    like an iron pillar or a bronze wall.\nYou will stand\
      \ against the whole land—\n    the kings, officials, priests, and people of\
      \ Judah.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They will fight you, but they will fail.\n    For I am with you, and I\
      \ will take care of you.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!”"
  2:
    1: '¹ The Lord gave me another message. He said, '
    2: "² “Go and shout this message to Jerusalem. This is what the Lord says: \n\
      “I remember how eager you were to please me\n    as a young bride long ago,\n\
      how you loved me and followed me\n    even through the barren wilderness.\n"
    3: "³ In those days Israel was holy to the Lord,\n    the first of his children.\n\
      All who harmed his people were declared guilty,\n    and disaster fell on them.\n\
      \    I, the Lord, have spoken!” \n"
    4: '⁴ Listen to the word of the Lord, people of Jacob—all you families of Israel! '
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“What did your ancestors find wrong with me\n\
      \    that led them to stray so far from me?\nThey worshiped worthless idols,\n\
      \    only to become worthless themselves.\n"
    6: "⁶ They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord\n    who brought us safely out of Egypt\n\
      and led us through the barren wilderness—\n    a land of deserts and pits,\n\
      a land of drought and death,\n    where no one lives or even travels?’ \n"
    7: "⁷ “And when I brought you into a fruitful land\n    to enjoy its bounty and\
      \ goodness,\nyou defiled my land and\n    corrupted the possession I had promised\
      \ you.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests did not ask,\n    ‘Where is the Lord?’\nThose who taught my\
      \ word ignored me,\n    the rulers turned against me,\nand the prophets spoke\
      \ in the name of Baal,\n    wasting their time on worthless idols.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, I will bring my case against you,”\n    says the Lord.\n“I will\
      \ even bring charges against your children’s children\n    in the years to come.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Go west and look in the land of Cyprus;\n    go east and search through\
      \ the land of Kedar.\nHas anyone ever heard of anything\n    as strange as this?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has any nation ever traded its gods for new ones,\n    even though they\
      \ are not gods at all?\nYet my people have exchanged their glorious God\n  \
      \  for worthless idols!\n"
    12: "¹² The heavens are shocked at such a thing\n    and shrink back in horror\
      \ and dismay,”\n    says the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ “For my people have done two evil things:\nThey have abandoned me—\n \
      \   the fountain of living water.\nAnd they have dug for themselves cracked\
      \ cisterns\n    that can hold no water at all! \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Why has Israel become a slave?\n    Why has he been carried away as plunder?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Strong lions have roared against him,\n    and the land has been destroyed.\n\
      The towns are now in ruins,\n    and no one lives in them anymore.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Egyptians, marching from their cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes,\n    have\
      \ destroyed Israel’s glory and power.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And you have brought this upon yourselves\n    by rebelling against the\
      \ Lord your God,\n    even though he was leading you on the way! \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt\n    and your covenants\
      \ with Assyria?\nWhat good to you are the streams of the Nile\n    or the waters\
      \ of the Euphrates River?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your wickedness will bring its own punishment.\n    Your turning from\
      \ me will shame you.\nYou will see what an evil, bitter thing it is\n    to\
      \ abandon the Lord your God and not to fear him.\n    I, the Lord, the Lord\
      \ of Heaven’s Armies, have spoken! \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Long ago I broke the yoke that oppressed you\n    and tore away the chains\
      \ of your slavery,\nbut still you said,\n    ‘I will not serve you.’\nOn every\
      \ hill and under every green tree,\n    you have prostituted yourselves by bowing\
      \ down to idols.\n"
    21: "²¹ But I was the one who planted you,\n    choosing a vine of the purest\
      \ stock—the very best.\n    How did you grow into this corrupt wild vine?\n"
    22: "²² No amount of soap or lye can make you clean.\n    I still see the stain\
      \ of your guilt.\n    I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken! \n"
    23: "²³ “You say, ‘That’s not true!\n    I haven’t worshiped the images of Baal!’\n\
      But how can you say that?\n    Go and look in any valley in the land!\nFace\
      \ the awful sins you have done.\n    You are like a restless female camel\n\
      \    desperately searching for a mate.\n"
    24: "²⁴ You are like a wild donkey,\n    sniffing the wind at mating time.\nWho\
      \ can restrain her lust?\n    Those who desire her don’t need to search,\n \
      \   for she goes running to them!\n"
    25: "²⁵ When will you stop running?\n    When will you stop panting after other\
      \ gods?\nBut you say, ‘Save your breath.\n    I’m in love with these foreign\
      \ gods,\n    and I can’t stop loving them now!’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “Israel is like a thief\n    who feels shame only when he gets caught.\n\
      They, their kings, officials, priests, and prophets—\n    all are alike in this.\n"
    27: "²⁷ To an image carved from a piece of wood they say,\n    ‘You are my father.’\n\
      To an idol chiseled from a block of stone they say,\n    ‘You are my mother.’\n\
      They turn their backs on me,\n    but in times of trouble they cry out to me,\n\
      \    ‘Come and save us!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ But why not call on these gods you have made?\n    When trouble comes,\
      \ let them save you if they can!\nFor you have as many gods\n    as there are\
      \ towns in Judah.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Why do you accuse me of doing wrong?\n    You are the ones who have rebelled,”\n\
      \    says the Lord.\n"
    30: "³⁰ “I have punished your children,\n    but they did not respond to my discipline.\n\
      You yourselves have killed your prophets\n    as a lion kills its prey. \n"
    31: "³¹ “O my people, listen to the words of the Lord!\n    Have I been like a\
      \ desert to Israel?\n    Have I been to them a land of darkness?\nWhy then do\
      \ my people say, ‘At last we are free from God!\n    We don’t need him anymore!’\n"
    32: "³² Does a young woman forget her jewelry,\n    or a bride her wedding dress?\n\
      Yet for years on end\n    my people have forgotten me. \n"
    33: "³³ “How you plot and scheme to win your lovers.\n    Even an experienced\
      \ prostitute could learn from you!\n"
    34: "³⁴ Your clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor,\n\
      \    though you didn’t catch them breaking into your houses!\n"
    35: "³⁵ And yet you say,\n‘I have done nothing wrong.\n    Surely God isn’t angry\
      \ with me!’\nBut now I will punish you severely\n    because you claim you have\
      \ not sinned.\n"
    36: "³⁶ First here, then there—\n    you flit from one ally to another asking\
      \ for help.\nBut your new friends in Egypt will let you down,\n    just as Assyria\
      \ did before.\n"
    37: "³⁷ In despair, you will be led into exile\n    with your hands on your heads,\n\
      for the Lord has rejected the nations you trust.\n    They will not help you\
      \ at all."
  3:
    1: "¹ “If a man divorces a woman\n    and she goes and marries someone else,\n\
      he will not take her back again,\n    for that would surely corrupt the land.\n\
      But you have prostituted yourself with many lovers,\n    so why are you trying\
      \ to come back to me?”\n    says the Lord.\n"
    2: "² “Look at the shrines on every hilltop.\n    Is there any place you have\
      \ not been defiled\n    by your adultery with other gods?\nYou sit like a prostitute\
      \ beside the road waiting for a customer.\n    You sit alone like a nomad in\
      \ the desert.\nYou have polluted the land with your prostitution\n    and your\
      \ wickedness.\n"
    3: "³ That’s why even the spring rains have failed.\n    For you are a brazen\
      \ prostitute and completely shameless.\n"
    4: "⁴ Yet you say to me,\n    ‘Father, you have been my guide since my youth.\n"
    5: "⁵ Surely you won’t be angry forever!\n    Surely you can forget about it!’\n\
      So you talk,\n    but you keep on doing all the evil you can.” \n"
    6: '⁶ During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, “Have you seen what
      fickle Israel has done? Like a wife who commits adultery, Israel has worshiped
      other gods on every hill and under every green tree. '
    7: '⁷ I thought, ‘After she has done all this, she will return to me.’ But she
      did not return, and her faithless sister Judah saw this. '
    8: '⁸ She saw that I divorced faithless Israel because of her adultery. But that
      treacherous sister Judah had no fear, and now she, too, has left me and given
      herself to prostitution. '
    9: '⁹ Israel treated it all so lightly—she thought nothing of committing adultery
      by worshiping idols made of wood and stone. So now the land has been polluted. '
    10: "¹⁰ But despite all this, her faithless sister Judah has never sincerely returned\
      \ to me. She has only pretended to be sorry. I, the Lord, have spoken!” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Even faithless Israel is less guilty than treacherous
      Judah! '
    12: "¹² Therefore, go and give this message to Israel. This is what the Lord says:\n\
      “O Israel, my faithless people,\n    come home to me again,\nfor I am merciful.\n\
      \    I will not be angry with you forever.\n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge your guilt.\n    Admit that you rebelled against the\
      \ Lord your God\nand committed adultery against him\n    by worshiping idols\
      \ under every green tree.\nConfess that you refused to listen to my voice.\n\
      \    I, the Lord, have spoken! \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Return home, you wayward children,”\n    says the Lord,\n    “for I am\
      \ your master.\nI will bring you back to the land of Israel—\n    one from this\
      \ town and two from that family—\n    from wherever you are scattered.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will give you shepherds after my own heart,\n    who will guide\
      \ you with knowledge and understanding. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “And when your land is once more filled with people,” says the Lord, “you
      will no longer wish for ‘the good old days’ when you possessed the Ark of the
      Lord’s Covenant. You will not miss those days or even remember them, and there
      will be no need to rebuild the Ark. '
    17: '¹⁷ In that day Jerusalem will be known as ‘The Throne of the Lord.’ All nations
      will come there to honor the Lord. They will no longer stubbornly follow their
      own evil desires. '
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the people of Judah and Israel will return together from\
      \ exile in the north. They will return to the land I gave your ancestors as\
      \ an inheritance forever. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I thought to myself,\n    ‘I would love to treat you as my own children!’\n\
      I wanted nothing more than to give you this beautiful land—\n    the finest\
      \ possession in the world.\nI looked forward to your calling me ‘Father,’\n\
      \    and I wanted you never to turn from me.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But you have been unfaithful to me, you people of Israel!\n    You have\
      \ been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband.\n    I, the Lord, have\
      \ spoken.” \n"
    21: "²¹ Voices are heard high on the windswept mountains,\n    the weeping and\
      \ pleading of Israel’s people.\nFor they have chosen crooked paths\n    and\
      \ have forgotten the Lord their God. \n"
    22: "²² “My wayward children,” says the Lord,\n    “come back to me, and I will\
      \ heal your wayward hearts.”\n“Yes, we’re coming,” the people reply,\n    “for\
      \ you are the Lord our God.\n"
    23: "²³ Our worship of idols on the hills\n    and our religious orgies on the\
      \ mountains\n    are a delusion.\nOnly in the Lord our God\n    will Israel\
      \ ever find salvation.\n"
    24: "²⁴ From childhood we have watched\n    as everything our ancestors worked\
      \ for—\ntheir flocks and herds, their sons and daughters—\n    was squandered\
      \ on a delusion.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Let us now lie down in shame\n    and cover ourselves with dishonor,\n\
      for we and our ancestors have sinned\n    against the Lord our God.\nFrom our\
      \ childhood to this day\n    we have never obeyed him.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ “O Israel,” says the Lord,\n    “if you wanted to return to me, you could.\n\
      You could throw away your detestable idols\n    and stray away no more.\n"
    2: "² Then when you swear by my name, saying,\n    ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’\n\
      you could do so\n    with truth, justice, and righteousness.\nThen you would\
      \ be a blessing to the nations of the world,\n    and all people would come\
      \ and praise my name.” \n"
    3: "³ This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem:\n“Plow\
      \ up the hard ground of your hearts!\n    Do not waste your good seed among\
      \ thorns.\n"
    4: "⁴ O people of Judah and Jerusalem,\n    surrender your pride and power.\n\
      Change your hearts before the Lord,\n    or my anger will burn like an unquenchable\
      \ fire\n    because of all your sins. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Shout to Judah, and broadcast to Jerusalem!\n    Tell them to sound the\
      \ alarm throughout the land:\n‘Run for your lives!\n    Flee to the fortified\
      \ cities!’\n"
    6: "⁶ Raise a signal flag as a warning for Jerusalem:\n    ‘Flee now! Do not delay!’\n\
      For I am bringing terrible destruction upon you\n    from the north.” \n"
    7: "⁷ A lion stalks from its den,\n    a destroyer of nations.\nIt has left its\
      \ lair and is headed your way.\n    It’s going to devastate your land!\nYour\
      \ towns will lie in ruins,\n    with no one living in them anymore.\n"
    8: "⁸ So put on clothes of mourning\n    and weep with broken hearts,\nfor the\
      \ fierce anger of the Lord\n    is still upon us. \n"
    9: "⁹ “In that day,” says the Lord,\n    “the king and the officials will tremble\
      \ in fear.\nThe priests will be struck with horror,\n    and the prophets will\
      \ be appalled.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “O Sovereign Lord,\n    the people have been deceived by\
      \ what you said,\nfor you promised peace for Jerusalem.\n    But the sword is\
      \ held at their throats!” \n"
    11: "¹¹ The time is coming when the Lord will say\n    to the people of Jerusalem,\n\
      “My dear people, a burning wind is blowing in from the desert,\n    and it’s\
      \ not a gentle breeze useful for winnowing grain.\n"
    12: "¹² It is a roaring blast sent by me!\n    Now I will pronounce your destruction!”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Our enemy rushes down on us like storm clouds!\n    His chariots are like\
      \ whirlwinds.\nHis horses are swifter than eagles.\n    How terrible it will\
      \ be, for we are doomed!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ O Jerusalem, cleanse your heart\n    that you may be saved.\nHow long\
      \ will you harbor\n    your evil thoughts?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Your destruction has been announced\n    from Dan and the hill country\
      \ of Ephraim. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Warn the surrounding nations\n    and announce this to Jerusalem:\nThe\
      \ enemy is coming from a distant land,\n    raising a battle cry against the\
      \ towns of Judah.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They surround Jerusalem like watchmen around a field,\n    for my people\
      \ have rebelled against me,”\n    says the Lord.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Your own actions have brought this upon you.\n    This punishment is\
      \ bitter, piercing you to the heart!” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ My heart, my heart—I writhe in pain!\n    My heart pounds within me! I\
      \ cannot be still.\nFor I have heard the blast of enemy trumpets\n    and the\
      \ roar of their battle cries.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Waves of destruction roll over the land,\n    until it lies in complete\
      \ desolation.\nSuddenly my tents are destroyed;\n    in a moment my shelters\
      \ are crushed.\n"
    21: "²¹ How long must I see the battle flags\n    and hear the trumpets of war?\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² “My people are foolish\n    and do not know me,” says the Lord.\n“They\
      \ are stupid children\n    who have no understanding.\nThey are clever enough\
      \ at doing wrong,\n    but they have no idea how to do right!” \n"
    23: "²³ I looked at the earth, and it was empty and formless.\n    I looked at\
      \ the heavens, and there was no light.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I looked at the mountains and hills,\n    and they trembled and shook.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I looked, and all the people were gone.\n    All the birds of the sky\
      \ had flown away.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I looked, and the fertile fields had become a wilderness.\n    The towns\
      \ lay in ruins,\n    crushed by the Lord’s fierce anger. \n"
    27: "²⁷ This is what the Lord says:\n“The whole land will be ruined,\n    but\
      \ I will not destroy it completely.\n"
    28: "²⁸ The earth will mourn\n    and the heavens will be draped in black\nbecause\
      \ of my decree against my people.\n    I have made up my mind and will not change\
      \ it.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ At the noise of charioteers and archers,\n    the people flee in terror.\n\
      They hide in the bushes\n    and run for the mountains.\nAll the towns have\
      \ been abandoned—\n    not a person remains!\n"
    30: "³⁰ What are you doing,\n    you who have been plundered?\nWhy do you dress\
      \ up in beautiful clothing\n    and put on gold jewelry?\nWhy do you brighten\
      \ your eyes with mascara?\n    Your primping will do you no good!\nThe allies\
      \ who were your lovers\n    despise you and seek to kill you. \n"
    31: "³¹ I hear a cry, like that of a woman in labor,\n    the groans of a woman\
      \ giving birth to her first child.\nIt is beautiful Jerusalem\n    gasping for\
      \ breath and crying out,\n    “Help! I’m being murdered!”"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Run up and down every street in Jerusalem,” says the Lord.\n    “Look high\
      \ and low; search throughout the city!\nIf you can find even one just and honest\
      \ person,\n    I will not destroy the city.\n"
    2: "² But even when they are under oath,\n    saying, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’\n\
      \    they are still telling lies!” \n"
    3: "³ Lord, you are searching for honesty.\nYou struck your people,\n    but they\
      \ paid no attention.\nYou crushed them,\n    but they refused to be corrected.\n\
      They are determined, with faces set like stone;\n    they have refused to repent.\

    9: "⁹ Should I not punish them for this?” says the Lord.\n    “Should I not avenge\
      \ myself against such a nation?” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will weep for the mountains\n    and wail for the wilderness pastures.\n\
      For they are desolate and empty of life;\n    the lowing of cattle is heard\
      \ no more;\n    the birds and wild animals have all fled. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “I will make Jerusalem into a heap of ruins,” says the Lord.\n    “It\
      \ will be a place haunted by jackals.\nThe towns of Judah will be ghost towns,\n\
      \    with no one living in them.” \n"
    12: "¹² Who is wise enough to understand all this? Who has been instructed by\
      \ the Lord and can explain it to others? Why has the land been so ruined that\
      \ no one dares to travel through it? \n"
    13: '¹³ The Lord replies, “This has happened because my people have abandoned
      my instructions; they have refused to obey what I said. '
    14: '¹⁴ Instead, they have stubbornly followed their own desires and worshiped
      the images of Baal, as their ancestors taught them. '
    15: '¹⁵ So now, this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says:
      Look! I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink. '
    16: "¹⁶ I will scatter them around the world, in places they and their ancestors\
      \ never heard of, and even there I will chase them with the sword until I have\
      \ destroyed them completely.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“Consider all this, and\

    18: "¹⁸ Quick! Begin your weeping!\n    Let the tears flow from your eyes.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Hear the people of Jerusalem crying in despair,\n    ‘We are ruined! We\

    20: "²⁰ Listen, you women, to the words of the Lord;\n    open your ears to what\
      \ he has to say.\nTeach your daughters to wail;\n    teach one another how to\
      \ lament.\n"
    21: "²¹ For death has crept in through our windows\n    and has entered our mansions.\n\
      It has killed off the flower of our youth:\n    Children no longer play in the\
      \ streets,\n    and young men no longer gather in the squares. \n"
    22: "²² This is what the Lord says:\n“Bodies will be scattered across the fields\
      \ like clumps of manure,\n    like bundles of grain after the harvest.\n   \
      \ No one will be left to bury them.” \n"
    23: "²³ This is what the Lord says:\n“Don’t let the wise boast in their wisdom,\n\
      \    or the powerful boast in their power,\n    or the rich boast in their riches.\n"
    24: "²⁴ But those who wish to boast\n    should boast in this alone:\nthat they\
      \ truly know me and understand that I am the Lord\n    who demonstrates unfailing\
      \ love\n    and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,\nand that\
      \ I delight in these things.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken! \n"
    25: '²⁵ “A time is coming,” says the Lord, “when I will punish all those who are
      circumcised in body but not in spirit— '
    26: ²⁶ the Egyptians, Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, the people who live in the
      desert in remote places, and yes, even the people of Judah. And like all these
      pagan nations, the people of Israel also have uncircumcised hearts.”
  10:
    1: '¹ Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O Israel! '
    2: "² This is what the Lord says:\n“Do not act like the other nations,\n    who\

    3: "³ Their ways are futile and foolish.\n    They cut down a tree, and a craftsman\

    4: "⁴ They decorate it with gold and silver\n    and then fasten it securely with\

    5: "⁵ Their gods are like\n    helpless scarecrows in a cucumber field!\nThey\

    6: "⁶ Lord, there is no one like you!\n    For you are great, and your name is\
      \ full of power.\n"
    7: "⁷ Who would not fear you, O King of nations?\n    That title belongs to you\
      \ alone!\nAmong all the wise people of the earth\n    and in all the kingdoms\
      \ of the world,\n    there is no one like you. \n"
    8: "⁸ People who worship idols are stupid and foolish.\n    The things they worship\
      \ are made of wood!\n"
    9: "⁹ They bring beaten sheets of silver from Tarshish\n    and gold from Uphaz,\n\
      and they give these materials to skillful craftsmen\n    who make their idols.\n\

    10: "¹⁰ But the Lord is the only true God.\n    He is the living God and the everlasting\

    11: "¹¹ Say this to those who worship other gods: “Your so-called gods, who did\

    12: "¹² But the Lord made the earth by his power,\n    and he preserves it by\

    13: "¹³ When he speaks in the thunder,\n    the heavens roar with rain.\nHe causes\
      \ the clouds to rise over the earth.\n    He sends the lightning with the rain\n\
      \    and releases the wind from his storehouses.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!\n    The craftsmen\

    15: "¹⁵ Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!\n    On the day of reckoning\

  11:
    1: '¹ The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, '
    2: '² “Remind the people of Judah and Jerusalem about the terms of my covenant
      with them. '
    3: '³ Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is
      anyone who does not obey the terms of my covenant! '
    4: '⁴ For I said to your ancestors when I brought them out of the iron-smelting
      furnace of Egypt, “If you obey me and do whatever I command you, then you will
      be my people, and I will be your God.” '
    5: "⁵ I said this so I could keep my promise to your ancestors to give you a land\
      \ flowing with milk and honey—the land you live in today.’”\nThen I replied,\
      \ “Amen, Lord! May it be so.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the Lord said, “Broadcast this message in the streets of Jerusalem.
      Go from town to town throughout the land and say, ‘Remember the ancient covenant,
      and do everything it requires. '
    7: '⁷ For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, “Obey
      me!” I have repeated this warning over and over to this day, '
    8: "⁸ but your ancestors did not listen or even pay attention. Instead, they stubbornly\
      \ followed their own evil desires. And because they refused to obey, I brought\
      \ upon them all the curses described in this covenant.’” \n"
    9: '⁹ Again the Lord spoke to me and said, “I have discovered a conspiracy against
      me among the people of Judah and Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ They have returned to the sins of their ancestors. They have refused to
      listen to me and are worshiping other gods. Israel and Judah have both broken
      the covenant I made with their ancestors. '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am going to bring calamity upon
      them, and they will not escape. Though they beg for mercy, I will not listen
      to their cries. '
    12: '¹² Then the people of Judah and Jerusalem will pray to their idols and burn
      incense before them. But the idols will not save them when disaster strikes! '
    13: "¹³ Look now, people of Judah; you have as many gods as you have towns. You\
      \ have as many altars of shame—altars for burning incense to your god Baal—as\
      \ there are streets in Jerusalem. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them,\
      \ for I will not listen to them when they cry out to me in distress. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “What right do my beloved people have to come to my Temple,\n    when\
      \ they have done so many immoral things?\nCan their vows and sacrifices prevent\
      \ their destruction?\n    They actually rejoice in doing evil!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I, the Lord, once called them a thriving olive tree,\n    beautiful to\
      \ see and full of good fruit.\nBut now I have sent the fury of their enemies\n\
      \    to burn them with fire,\n    leaving them charred and broken. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “I, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, who planted this olive tree, have ordered\
      \ it destroyed. For the people of Israel and Judah have done evil, arousing\
      \ my anger by burning incense to Baal.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the Lord told me about the plots my enemies were making against me. '
    19: "¹⁹ I was like a lamb being led to the slaughter. I had no idea that they\
      \ were planning to kill me! “Let’s destroy this man and all his words,” they\
      \ said. “Let’s cut him down, so his name will be forgotten forever.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ O Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\nyou make righteous judgments,\n    and you\
      \ examine the deepest thoughts and secrets.\nLet me see your vengeance against\
      \ them,\n    for I have committed my cause to you. \n"
    21: '²¹ This is what the Lord says about the men of Anathoth who wanted me dead.
      They had said, “We will kill you if you do not stop prophesying in the Lord’s
      name.” '
    22: '²² So this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says about them: “I will punish
      them! Their young men will die in battle, and their boys and girls will starve
      to death. '
    23: ²³ Not one of these plotters from Anathoth will survive, for I will bring
      disaster upon them when their time of punishment comes.”
  12:
    1: "¹ Lord, you always give me justice\n    when I bring a case before you.\n\
      So let me bring you this complaint:\nWhy are the wicked so prosperous?\n   \
      \ Why are evil people so happy?\n"
    2: "² You have planted them,\n    and they have taken root and prospered.\nYour\
      \ name is on their lips,\n    but you are far from their hearts.\n"
    3: "³ But as for me, Lord, you know my heart.\n    You see me and test my thoughts.\n\
      Drag these people away like sheep to be butchered!\n    Set them aside to be\
      \ slaughtered! \n"
    4: "⁴ How long must this land mourn?\n    Even the grass in the fields has withered.\n\
      The wild animals and birds have disappeared\n    because of the evil in the\
      \ land.\nFor the people have said,\n    “The Lord doesn’t see what’s ahead for\
      \ us!” \n"
    5: "⁵ “If racing against mere men makes you tired,\n    how will you race against\
      \ horses?\nIf you stumble and fall on open ground,\n    what will you do in\
      \ the thickets near the Jordan?\n"
    6: "⁶ Even your brothers, members of your own family,\n    have turned against\
      \ you.\n    They plot and raise complaints against you.\nDo not trust them,\n\
      \    no matter how pleasantly they speak. \n"
    7: "⁷ “I have abandoned my people, my special possession.\n    I have surrendered\
      \ my dearest ones to their enemies.\n"
    8: "⁸ My chosen people have roared at me like a lion of the forest,\n    so I\
      \ have treated them with contempt.\n"
    9: "⁹ My chosen people act like speckled vultures,\n    but they themselves are\
      \ surrounded by vultures.\n    Bring on the wild animals to pick their corpses\
      \ clean! \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Many rulers have ravaged my vineyard,\n    trampling down the vines\n\
      \    and turning all its beauty into a barren wilderness.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They have made it an empty wasteland;\n    I hear its mournful cry.\n\
      The whole land is desolate,\n    and no one even cares.\n"
    12: "¹² On all the bare hilltops,\n    destroying armies can be seen.\nThe sword\
      \ of the Lord devours people\n    from one end of the nation to the other.\n\
      \    No one will escape!\n"
    13: "¹³ My people have planted wheat\n    but are harvesting thorns.\nThey have\
      \ worn themselves out,\n    but it has done them no good.\nThey will harvest\
      \ a crop of shame\n    because of the fierce anger of the Lord.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now this is what the Lord says: “I will uproot from their land all the
      evil nations reaching out for the possession I gave my people Israel. And I
      will uproot Judah from among them. '
    15: '¹⁵ But afterward I will return and have compassion on all of them. I will
      bring them home to their own lands again, each nation to its own possession. '
    16: '¹⁶ And if these nations truly learn the ways of my people, and if they learn
      to swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the Lord lives’ (just as they taught
      my people to swear by the name of Baal), then they will be given a place among
      my people. '
    17: ¹⁷ But any nation who refuses to obey me will be uprooted and destroyed. I,
      the Lord, have spoken!”
  13:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and buy a linen loincloth and put
      it on, but do not wash it.” '
    2: "² So I bought the loincloth as the Lord directed me, and I put it on. \n"
    3: '³ Then the Lord gave me another message: '
    4: '⁴ “Take the linen loincloth you are wearing, and go to the Euphrates River.
      Hide it there in a hole in the rocks.” '
    5: "⁵ So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord had instructed me. \n"
    6: '⁶ A long time afterward the Lord said to me, “Go back to the Euphrates and
      get the loincloth I told you to hide there.” '
    7: "⁷ So I went to the Euphrates and dug it out of the hole where I had hidden\
      \ it. But now it was rotting and falling apart. The loincloth was good for nothing.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Then I received this message from the Lord: '
    9: '⁹ “This is what the Lord says: This shows how I will rot away the pride of
      Judah and Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ These wicked people refuse to listen to me. They stubbornly follow their
      own desires and worship other gods. Therefore, they will become like this loincloth—good
      for nothing! '
    11: "¹¹ As a loincloth clings to a man’s waist, so I created Judah and Israel\
      \ to cling to me, says the Lord. They were to be my people, my pride, my glory—an\
      \ honor to my name. But they would not listen to me. \n"
    12: "¹² “So tell them, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: May all\
      \ your jars be filled with wine.’ And they will reply, ‘Of course! Jars are\
      \ made to be filled with wine!’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “Then tell them, ‘No, this is what the Lord means: I will fill everyone
      in this land with drunkenness—from the king sitting on David’s throne to the
      priests and the prophets, right down to the common people of Jerusalem. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will smash them against each other, even parents against children, says\
      \ the Lord. I will not let my pity or mercy or compassion keep me from destroying\
      \ them.’” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Listen and pay attention!\n    Do not be arrogant, for the Lord has spoken.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Give glory to the Lord your God\n    before it is too late.\nAcknowledge\
      \ him before he brings darkness upon you,\n    causing you to stumble and fall\

      \ find only terrible darkness and gloom.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And if you still refuse to listen,\n    I will weep alone because of your\
      \ pride.\nMy eyes will overflow with tears,\n    because the Lord’s flock will\
      \ be led away into exile. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Say to the king and his mother,\n“Come down from your thrones\n    and\
      \ sit in the dust,\nfor your glorious crowns\n    will soon be snatched from\
      \ your heads.”\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The towns of the Negev will close their gates,\n    and no one will be\
      \ able to open them.\nThe people of Judah will be taken away as captives.\n\
      \    All will be carried into exile. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Open up your eyes and see\n    the armies marching down from the north!\n\
      Where is your flock—\n    your beautiful flock—\n    that he gave you to care\
      \ for?\n"
    21: "²¹ What will you say when the Lord takes the allies you have cultivated\n\
      \    and appoints them as your rulers?\nPangs of anguish will grip you,\n  \
      \  like those of a woman in labor!\n"
    22: "²² You may ask yourself,\n“Why is all this happening to me?”\n    It is because\
      \ of your many sins!\nThat is why you have been stripped\n    and raped by invading\
      \ armies.\n"
    23: "²³ Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin?\n    Can a leopard take\
      \ away its spots?\nNeither can you start doing good,\n    for you have always\
      \ done evil. \n"
    24: "²⁴ “I will scatter you like chaff\n    that is blown away by the desert winds.\n"

  14:

    4: "⁴ The ground is parched\n    and cracked for lack of rain.\nThe farmers are\

    7: "⁷ The people say, “Our wickedness has caught up with us, Lord,\n    but help\

      no war or famine will come, but they themselves will die by war and famine! '
    16: '¹⁶ As for the people to whom they prophesy—their bodies will be thrown out
      into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and war. There will be no one
      left to bury them. Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters—all will be gone. For
      I will pour out their own wickedness on them. '
    17: "¹⁷ Now, Jeremiah, say this to them:\n“Night and day my eyes overflow with\
      \ tears.\n    I cannot stop weeping,\nfor my virgin daughter—my precious people—\n\

    18: "¹⁸ If I go out into the fields,\n    I see the bodies of people slaughtered\

    19: "¹⁹ Lord, have you completely rejected Judah?\n    Do you really hate Jerusalem?\n\
      Why have you wounded us past all hope of healing?\n    We hoped for peace, but\
      \ no peace came.\n    We hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Lord, we confess our wickedness\n    and that of our ancestors, too.\n\

    21: "²¹ For the sake of your reputation, Lord, do not abandon us.\n    Do not\

      \ your covenant with us. \n"
    22: "²² Can any of the worthless foreign gods send us rain?\n    Does it fall\
      \ from the sky by itself?\nNo, you are the one, O Lord our God!\n    Only you\

  15:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me pleading
      for these people, I wouldn’t help them. Away with them! Get them out of my sight! '
    2: "² And if they say to you, ‘But where can we go?’ tell them, ‘This is what\

    3: '³ “I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” says the Lord. “I will

    6: "⁶ You have abandoned me\n    and turned your back on me,”\n    says the Lord.\n\
      “Therefore, I will raise my fist to destroy you.\n    I am tired of always giving\
      \ you another chance.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will winnow you like grain at the gates of your cities\n    and take away\

    8: "⁸ There will be more widows\n    than the grains of sand on the seashore.\n\
      At noontime I will bring a destroyer\n    against the mothers of young men.\n\

    9: "⁹ The mother of seven grows faint and gasps for breath;\n    her sun has gone\

    10: "¹⁰ Then I said,\n“What sorrow is mine, my mother.\n    Oh, that I had died\
      \ at birth!\n    I am hated everywhere I go.\nI am neither a lender who threatens\

    16: "¹⁶ When I discovered your words, I devoured them.\n    They are my joy and\

    17: "¹⁷ I never joined the people in their merry feasts.\n    I sat alone because\

    5: '⁵ This is what the Lord says: “Do not go to funerals to mourn and show sympathy
      for these people, for I have removed my protection and peace from them. I have
      taken away my unfailing love and my mercy. '
    6: '⁶ Both the great and the lowly will die in this land. No one will bury them
      or mourn for them. Their friends will not cut themselves in sorrow or shave
      their heads in sadness. '
    7: "⁷ No one will offer a meal to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even\

    8: '⁸ “And do not go to their feasts and parties. Do not eat and drink with them

    11: '¹¹ “Then you will give them the Lord’s reply: ‘It is because your ancestors
      were unfaithful to me. They worshiped other gods and served them. They abandoned

    12: '¹² And you are even worse than your ancestors! You stubbornly follow your

    7: "⁷ O Lord, you misled me,\n    and I allowed myself to be misled.\nYou are\
      \ stronger than I am,\n    and you overpowered me.\nNow I am mocked every day;\n\
      \    everyone laughs at me.\n"
    8: "⁸ When I speak, the words burst out.\n    “Violence and destruction!” I shout.\n\
      So these messages from the Lord\n    have made me a household joke.\n"
    9: "⁹ But if I say I’ll never mention the Lord\n    or speak in his name,\nhis\
      \ word burns in my heart like a fire.\n    It’s like a fire in my bones!\nI\
      \ am worn out trying to hold it in!\n    I can’t do it!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I have heard the many rumors about me.\n    They call me “The Man Who\
      \ Lives in Terror.”\nThey threaten, “If you say anything, we will report it.”\n\
      \    Even my old friends are watching me,\n    waiting for a fatal slip.\n“He\
      \ will trap himself,” they say,\n    “and then we will get our revenge on him.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ But the Lord stands beside me like a great warrior.\n    Before him my\
      \ persecutors will stumble.\n    They cannot defeat me.\nThey will fail and\

      \ them,\n    for I have committed my cause to you.\n"
    13: "¹³ Sing to the Lord!\n    Praise the Lord!\nFor though I was poor and needy,\n\

    16: "¹⁶ Let him be destroyed like the cities of old\n    that the Lord overthrew\
      \ without mercy.\nTerrify him all day long with battle shouts,\n"
    17: "¹⁷     because he did not kill me at birth.\nOh, that I had died in my mother’s\
      \ womb,\n    that her body had been my grave!\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Why was I ever born?\n    My entire life has been filled\n    with trouble,\
      \ sorrow, and shame."
  21:
    1: '¹ The Lord spoke through Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malkijah
      and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to speak with him. They begged Jeremiah, '
    2: "² “Please speak to the Lord for us and ask him to help us. King Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ of Babylon is attacking Judah. Perhaps the Lord will be gracious and do a\
      \ mighty miracle as he has done in the past. Perhaps he will force Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ to withdraw his armies.” \n"
    3: '³ Jeremiah replied, “Go back to King Zedekiah and tell him, '
    4: '⁴ ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I will make your weapons
      useless against the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside your
      walls attacking you. In fact, I will bring your enemies right into the heart
      of this city. '
    5: '⁵ I myself will fight against you with a strong hand and a powerful arm, for
      I am very angry. You have made me furious! '
    6: '⁶ I will send a terrible plague upon this city, and both people and animals
      will die. '
    7: "⁷ And after all that, says the Lord, I will hand over King Zedekiah, his staff,\
      \ and everyone else in the city who survives the disease, war, and famine. I\
      \ will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their other enemies.\
      \ He will slaughter them and show them no mercy, pity, or compassion.’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Tell all the people, ‘This is what the Lord says: Take your choice of life
      or death! '
    9: '⁹ Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war, famine, or disease, but
      those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will live. Their reward will
      be life! '
    10: "¹⁰ For I have decided to bring disaster and not good upon this city, says\
      \ the Lord. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will reduce\
      \ it to ashes.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Say to the royal family of Judah, ‘Listen to this message from the Lord! '
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says to the dynasty of David: \n“‘Give justice each\
      \ morning to the people you judge!\n    Help those who have been robbed;\n \
      \   rescue them from their oppressors.\nOtherwise, my anger will burn like an\
      \ unquenchable fire\n    because of all your sins.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will personally fight against the people in Jerusalem,\n    that mighty\
      \ fortress—\nthe people who boast, “No one can touch us here.\n    No one can\
      \ break in here.”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And I myself will punish you for your sinfulness,\n    says the Lord.\n\
      I will light a fire in your forests\n    that will burn up everything around\

  22:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord said to me: “Go over and speak directly to the king

    2: '² ‘Listen to this message from the Lord, you king of Judah, sitting on David’s
      throne. Let your attendants and your people listen, too. '
    3: '³ This is what the Lord says: Be fair-minded and just. Do what is right! Help
      those who have been robbed; rescue them from their oppressors. Quit your evil
      deeds! Do not mistreat foreigners, orphans, and widows. Stop murdering the innocent! '
    4: '⁴ If you obey me, there will always be a descendant of David sitting on the
      throne here in Jerusalem. The king will ride through the palace gates in chariots
      and on horses, with his parade of attendants and subjects. '
    5: "⁵ But if you refuse to pay attention to this warning, I swear by my own name,\
      \ says the Lord, that this palace will become a pile of rubble.’” \n"
    6: "⁶ Now this is what the Lord says concerning Judah’s royal palace:\n“I love\

      \ I will turn you into a desert,\n    with no one living within your walls.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will call for wreckers,\n    who will bring out their tools to dismantle\
      \ you.\nThey will tear out all your fine cedar beams\n    and throw them on\
      \ the fire. \n"
    8: '⁸ “People from many nations will pass by the ruins of this city and say to
      one another, ‘Why did the Lord destroy such a great city?’ '
    9: "⁹ And the answer will be, ‘Because they violated their covenant with the Lord\
      \ their God by worshiping other gods.’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss.\n    Instead, weep for\
      \ the captive king being led away!\n    For he will never return to see his\
      \ native land again. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For this is what the Lord says about Jehoahaz, who succeeded his father,
      King Josiah, and was taken away as a captive: “He will never return. '
    12: "¹² He will die in a distant land and will never again see his own country.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ And the Lord says, “What sorrow awaits Jehoiakim,\n    who builds his\
      \ palace with forced labor.\nHe builds injustice into its walls,\n    for he\
      \ makes his neighbors work for nothing.\n    He does not pay them for their\
      \ labor.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He says, ‘I will build a magnificent palace\n    with huge rooms and many\
      \ windows.\nI will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar\n    and paint it\
      \ a lovely red.’\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king!\n    Your father,\
      \ Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink.\nBut he was just and right in all\
      \ his dealings.\n    That is why God blessed him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He gave justice and help to the poor and needy,\n    and everything went\
      \ well for him.\nIsn’t that what it means to know me?”\n    says the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “But you! You have eyes only for greed and dishonesty!\n    You murder\
      \ the innocent,\n    oppress the poor, and reign ruthlessly.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore, this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim, son of King Josiah:\n\
      “The people will not mourn for him, crying to one another,\n    ‘Alas, my brother!\
      \ Alas, my sister!’\nHis subjects will not mourn for him, crying,\n    ‘Alas,\
      \ our master is dead! Alas, his splendor is gone!’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will be buried like a dead donkey—\n    dragged out of Jerusalem and\
      \ dumped outside the gates!\n"
    20: "²⁰ Weep for your allies in Lebanon.\n    Shout for them in Bashan.\nSearch\
      \ for them in the regions east of the river.\n    See, they are all destroyed.\n\
      \    Not one is left to help you.\n"
    21: "²¹ I warned you when you were prosperous,\n    but you replied, ‘Don’t bother\
      \ me.’\nYou have been that way since childhood—\n    you simply will not obey\
      \ me!\n"
    22: "²² And now the wind will blow away your allies.\n    All your friends will\
      \ be taken away as captives.\n    Surely then you will see your wickedness and\
      \ be ashamed.\n"
    23: "²³ It may be nice to live in a beautiful palace\n    paneled with wood from\
      \ the cedars of Lebanon,\nbut soon you will groan with pangs of anguish—\n \
      \   anguish like that of a woman in labor. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “I will abandon you, Jehoiachin
      son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah. Even if you were the signet ring on my right
      hand, I would pull you off. '
    25: '²⁵ I will hand you over to those who seek to kill you, those you so desperately
      fear—to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the mighty Babylonian army. '
    26: '²⁶ I will expel you and your mother from this land, and you will die in a

  23:
    1: "¹ “What sorrow awaits the leaders of my people—the shepherds of my sheep—for\
      \ they have destroyed and scattered the very ones they were expected to care\
      \ for,” says the Lord. \n"
    2: '² Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to these shepherds:
      “Instead of caring for my flock and leading them to safety, you have deserted
      them and driven them to destruction. Now I will pour out judgment on you for
      the evil you have done to them. '
    3: '³ But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where
      I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they
      will be fruitful and increase in number. '
    4: "⁴ Then I will appoint responsible shepherds who will care for them, and they\
      \ will never be afraid again. Not a single one will be lost or missing. I, the\

    5: "⁵ “For the time is coming,”\n    says the Lord,\n“when I will raise up a righteous\

      no longer say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who rescued the people of Israel

    8: "⁸ Instead, they will say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the people\

    1: '¹ After King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon exiled Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim,

    9: '⁹ I will make them an object of horror and a symbol of evil to every nation

    18: '¹⁸ I went to Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah, and their kings and
      officials drank from the cup. From that day until this, they have been a desolate
      ruin, an object of horror, contempt, and cursing. '
    19: '¹⁹ I gave the cup to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials,
      and all his people, '
    20: '²⁰ along with all the foreigners living in that land. I also gave it to all
      the kings of the land of Uz and the kings of the Philistine cities of Ashkelon,
      Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod. '
    21: '²¹ Then I gave the cup to the nations of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, '
    22: '²² and the kings of Tyre and Sidon, and the kings of the regions across the
      sea. '
    23: '²³ I gave it to Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and to the people who live in distant
      places. '
    24: '²⁴ I gave it to the kings of Arabia, the kings of the nomadic tribes of the
      desert, '
    25: '²⁵ and to the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media. '
    26: "²⁶ And I gave it to the kings of the northern countries, far and near, one\
      \ after the other—all the kingdoms of the world. And finally, the king of Babylon\
      \ himself drank from the cup of the Lord’s anger. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then the Lord said to me, “Now tell them, ‘This is what the Lord of Heaven’s
      Armies, the God of Israel, says: Drink from this cup of my anger. Get drunk
      and vomit; fall to rise no more, for I am sending terrible wars against you.’ '
    28: '²⁸ And if they refuse to accept the cup, tell them, ‘The Lord of Heaven’s
      Armies says: You have no choice but to drink from it. '
    29: "²⁹ I have begun to punish Jerusalem, the city that bears my name. Now should\
      \ I let you go unpunished? No, you will not escape disaster. I will call for\
      \ war against all the nations of the earth. I, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\
      \ have spoken!’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ “Now prophesy all these things, and say to them,\n“‘The Lord will roar\
      \ against his own land\n    from his holy dwelling in heaven.\nHe will shout\
      \ like those who tread grapes;\n    he will shout against everyone on earth.\n"
    31: "³¹ His cry of judgment will reach the ends of the earth,\n    for the Lord\
      \ will bring his case against all the nations.\nHe will judge all the people\
      \ of the earth,\n    slaughtering the wicked with the sword.\n    I, the Lord,\
      \ have spoken!’” \n"
    32: "³² This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says:\n    “Look! Disaster will\
      \ fall upon nation after nation!\nA great whirlwind of fury is rising\n    from\
      \ the most distant corners of the earth!” \n"
    33: "³³ In that day those the Lord has slaughtered will fill the earth from one\
      \ end to the other. No one will mourn for them or gather up their bodies to\
      \ bury them. They will be scattered on the ground like manure. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Weep and moan, you evil shepherds!\n    Roll in the dust, you leaders\
      \ of the flock!\nThe time of your slaughter has arrived;\n    you will fall\
      \ and shatter like a fragile vase.\n"
    35: "³⁵ You will find no place to hide;\n    there will be no way to escape.\n"
    36: "³⁶ Listen to the frantic cries of the shepherds.\n    The leaders of the\
      \ flock are wailing in despair,\n    for the Lord is ruining their pastures.\n"
    37: "³⁷ Peaceful meadows will be turned into a wasteland\n    by the Lord’s fierce\
      \ anger.\n"
    38: "³⁸ He has left his den like a strong lion seeking its prey,\n    and their\
      \ land will be made desolate\nby the sword of the enemy\n    and the Lord’s\
      \ fierce anger."
  26:
    1: '¹ This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord early in the reign of Jehoiakim
      son of Josiah, king of Judah. '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says: Stand in the courtyard in front of the Temple
      of the Lord, and make an announcement to the people who have come there to worship
      from all over Judah. Give them my entire message; include every word. '
    3: "³ Perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways. Then I will change\
      \ my mind about the disaster I am ready to pour out on them because of their\
      \ sins. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: If you will not listen to me
      and obey my word I have given you, '
    5: '⁵ and if you will not listen to my servants, the prophets—for I sent them
      again and again to warn you, but you would not listen to them— '
    6: "⁶ then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed Shiloh, the place where the\
      \ Tabernacle was located. And I will make Jerusalem an object of cursing in\
      \ every nation on earth.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ The priests, the prophets, and all the people listened to Jeremiah as he
      spoke in front of the Lord’s Temple. '
    8: '⁸ But when Jeremiah had finished his message, saying everything the Lord had
      told him to say, the priests and prophets and all the people at the Temple mobbed
      him. “Kill him!” they shouted. '
    9: "⁹ “What right do you have to prophesy in the Lord’s name that this Temple\
      \ will be destroyed like Shiloh? What do you mean, saying that Jerusalem will\
      \ be destroyed and left with no inhabitants?” And all the people threatened\
      \ him as he stood in front of the Temple. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the officials of Judah heard what was happening, they rushed over
      from the palace and sat down at the New Gate of the Temple to hold court. '
    11: "¹¹ The priests and prophets presented their accusations to the officials\
      \ and the people. “This man should die!” they said. “You have heard with your\
      \ own ears what a traitor he is, for he has prophesied against this city.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jeremiah spoke to the officials and the people in his own defense.
      “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this Temple and this city,” he said. “The
      Lord gave me every word that I have spoken. '
    13: '¹³ But if you stop your sinning and begin to obey the Lord your God, he will
      change his mind about this disaster that he has announced against you. '
    14: '¹⁴ As for me, I am in your hands—do with me as you think best. '
    15: "¹⁵ But if you kill me, rest assured that you will be killing an innocent\
      \ man! The responsibility for such a deed will lie on you, on this city, and\
      \ on every person living in it. For it is absolutely true that the Lord sent\
      \ me to speak every word you have heard.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then the officials and the people said to the priests and prophets, “This\
      \ man does not deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name\
      \ of the Lord our God.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then some of the wise old men stood and spoke to all the people assembled
      there. '
    18: "¹⁸ They said, “Remember when Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign\
      \ of King Hezekiah of Judah. He told the people of Judah,\n‘This is what the\
      \ Lord of Heaven’s Armies says:\nMount Zion will be plowed like an open field;\n\
      \    Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins!\nA thicket will grow on the heights\n\
      \    where the Temple now stands.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ But did King Hezekiah and the people kill him for saying this? No, they\
      \ turned from their sins and worshiped the Lord. They begged him for mercy.\
      \ Then the Lord changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had pronounced\
      \ against them. So we are about to do ourselves great harm.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ At this time Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim was also prophesying
      for the Lord. And he predicted the same terrible disaster against the city and
      nation as Jeremiah did. '
    21: '²¹ When King Jehoiakim and the army officers and officials heard what he
      was saying, the king sent someone to kill him. But Uriah heard about the plan
      and escaped in fear to Egypt. '
    22: '²² Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt along with several
      other men to capture Uriah. '
    23: "²³ They took him prisoner and brought him back to King Jehoiakim. The king\
      \ then killed Uriah with a sword and had him buried in an unmarked grave. \n"
    24: ²⁴ Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan stood up for Jeremiah and persuaded
      the court not to turn him over to the mob to be killed.
  27:
    1: "¹ This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord early in the reign of Zedekiah\
      \ son of Josiah, king of Judah. \n"
    2: '² This is what the Lord said to me: “Make a yoke, and fasten it on your neck
      with leather straps. '
    3: '³ Then send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through
      their ambassadors who have come to see King Zedekiah in Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ Give them this message for their masters: ‘This is what the Lord of Heaven’s
      Armies, the God of Israel, says: '
    5: '⁵ With my great strength and powerful arm I made the earth and all its people
      and every animal. I can give these things of mine to anyone I choose. '
    6: '⁶ Now I will give your countries to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who is
      my servant. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control. '
    7: '⁷ All the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until his time
      is up. Then many nations and great kings will conquer and rule over Babylon. '
    8: "⁸ So you must submit to Babylon’s king and serve him; put your neck under\
      \ Babylon’s yoke! I will punish any nation that refuses to be his slave, says\
      \ the Lord. I will send war, famine, and disease upon that nation until Babylon\
      \ has conquered it. \n"
    9: '⁹ “‘Do not listen to your false prophets, fortune-tellers, interpreters of
      dreams, mediums, and sorcerers who say, “The king of Babylon will not conquer
      you.” '
    10: '¹⁰ They are all liars, and their lies will lead to your being driven out
      of your land. I will drive you out and send you far away to die. '
    11: "¹¹ But the people of any nation that submits to the king of Babylon will\
      \ be allowed to stay in their own country to farm the land as usual. I, the\
      \ Lord, have spoken!’” \n"
    12: '¹² Then I repeated this same message to King Zedekiah of Judah. “If you want
      to live, submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon and his people. '
    13: '¹³ Why do you insist on dying—you and your people? Why should you choose
      war, famine, and disease, which the Lord will bring against every nation that
      refuses to submit to Babylon’s king? '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not listen to the false prophets who keep telling you, ‘The king of
      Babylon will not conquer you.’ They are liars. '
    15: "¹⁵ This is what the Lord says: ‘I have not sent these prophets! They are\
      \ telling you lies in my name, so I will drive you from this land. You will\
      \ all die—you and all these prophets, too.’” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then I spoke to the priests and the people and said, “This is what the
      Lord says: ‘Do not listen to your prophets who claim that soon the gold articles
      taken from my Temple will be returned from Babylon. It is all a lie! '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not listen to them. Surrender to the king of Babylon, and you will
      live. Why should this whole city be destroyed? '
    18: "¹⁸ If they really are prophets and speak the Lord’s messages, let them pray\
      \ to the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. Let them pray that the articles remaining\
      \ in the Lord’s Temple and in the king’s palace and in the palaces of Jerusalem\
      \ will not be carried away to Babylon!’ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “For the Lord of Heaven’s Armies has spoken about the pillars in front
      of the Temple, the great bronze basin called the Sea, the water carts, and all
      the other ceremonial articles. '
    20: '²⁰ King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon left them here when he exiled Jehoiachin
      son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, to Babylon, along with all the other nobles
      of Judah and Jerusalem. '
    21: '²¹ Yes, this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says
      about the precious things still in the Temple, in the palace of Judah’s king,
      and in Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² ‘They will all be carried away to Babylon and will stay there until I send
      for them,’ says the Lord. ‘Then I will bring them back to Jerusalem again.’”
  28:
    1: '¹ One day in late summer of that same year—the fourth year of the reign of
      Zedekiah, king of Judah—Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, addressed
      me publicly in the Temple while all the priests and people listened. He said, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will
      remove the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks. '
    3: '³ Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar
      carried off to Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ And I will bring back Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all\
      \ the other captives that were taken to Babylon. I will surely break the yoke\
      \ that the king of Babylon has put on your necks. I, the Lord, have spoken!’”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Jeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests
      and people at the Temple. '
    6: '⁶ He said, “Amen! May your prophecies come true! I hope the Lord does everything
      you say. I hope he does bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple
      and all the captives. '
    7: '⁷ But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all
      these people. '
    8: '⁸ The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations,
      always warning of war, disaster, and disease. '
    9: "⁹ So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right. Only when his predictions\
      \ come true can we know that he is really from the Lord.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke
      it in pieces. '
    11: "¹¹ And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered, “This is what\
      \ the Lord says: ‘Just as this yoke has been broken, within two years I will\
      \ break the yoke of oppression from all the nations now subject to King Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ of Babylon.’” With that, Jeremiah left the Temple area. \n"
    12: '¹² Soon after this confrontation with Hananiah, the Lord gave this message
      to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You have broken a
      wooden yoke, but you have replaced it with a yoke of iron. '
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: I have put a yoke\
      \ of iron on the necks of all these nations, forcing them into slavery under\
      \ King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have put everything, even the wild animals,\
      \ under his control.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord
      has not sent you, but the people believe your lies. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘You must die. Your life will end\
      \ this very year because you have rebelled against the Lord.’” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ Two months later the prophet Hananiah died.
  29:
    1: '¹ Jeremiah wrote a letter from Jerusalem to the elders, priests, prophets,
      and all the people who had been exiled to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: '² This was after King Jehoiachin, the queen mother, the court officials, the
      other officials of Judah, and all the craftsmen and artisans had been deported
      from Jerusalem. '
    3: "³ He sent the letter with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah\
      \ when they went to Babylon as King Zedekiah’s ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar.\
      \ This is what Jeremiah’s letter said: \n"
    4: '⁴ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says to all
      the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem: '
    5: '⁵ “Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. '
    6: '⁶ Marry and have children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have
      many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! '
    7: "⁷ And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into\
      \ exile. Pray to the Lord for it, for its welfare will determine your welfare.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Do not
      let your prophets and fortune-tellers who are with you in the land of Babylon
      trick you. Do not listen to their dreams, '
    9: "⁹ because they are telling you lies in my name. I have not sent them,” says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ This is what the Lord says: “You will be in Babylon for seventy years.
      But then I will come and do for you all the good things I have promised, and
      I will bring you home again. '
    11: '¹¹ For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for
      good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. '
    12: '¹² In those days when you pray, I will listen. '
    13: '¹³ If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will be found by you,” says the Lord. “I will end your captivity and\
      \ restore your fortunes. I will gather you out of the nations where I sent you\
      \ and will bring you home again to your own land.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ You claim that the Lord has raised up prophets for you in Babylon. '
    16: '¹⁶ But this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David’s throne
      and all those still living here in Jerusalem—your relatives who were not exiled
      to Babylon. '
    17: '¹⁷ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says: “I will send war, famine,
      and disease upon them and make them like bad figs, too rotten to eat. '
    18: '¹⁸ Yes, I will pursue them with war, famine, and disease, and I will scatter
      them around the world. In every nation where I send them, I will make them an
      object of damnation, horror, contempt, and mockery. '
    19: "¹⁹ For they refuse to listen to me, though I have spoken to them repeatedly\
      \ through the prophets I sent. And you who are in exile have not listened either,”\
      \ says the Lord. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore, listen to this message from the Lord, all you captives there
      in Babylon. '
    21: '²¹ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says about
      your prophets—Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah—who are telling
      you lies in my name: “I will turn them over to Nebuchadnezzar for execution
      before your eyes. '
    22: '²² Their terrible fate will become proverbial, so that the Judean exiles
      will curse someone by saying, ‘May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab,
      whom the king of Babylon burned alive!’ '
    23: "²³ For these men have done terrible things among my people. They have committed\
      \ adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have lied in my name, saying things\
      \ I did not command. I am a witness to this. I, the Lord, have spoken.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ The Lord sent this message to Shemaiah the Nehelamite in Babylon: '
    25: "²⁵ “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: You\
      \ wrote a letter on your own authority to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest,\
      \ and you sent copies to the other priests and people in Jerusalem. You wrote\
      \ to Zephaniah, \n"
    26: '²⁶ “The Lord has appointed you to replace Jehoiada as the priest in charge
      of the house of the Lord. You are responsible to put into stocks and neck irons
      any crazy man who claims to be a prophet. '
    27: '²⁷ So why have you done nothing to stop Jeremiah from Anathoth, who pretends
      to be a prophet among you? '
    28: "²⁸ Jeremiah sent a letter here to Babylon, predicting that our captivity\
      \ will be a long one. He said, ‘Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens,\
      \ and eat the food they produce.’” \n"
    29: '²⁹ But when Zephaniah the priest received Shemaiah’s letter, he took it to
      Jeremiah and read it to him. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah: '
    31: '³¹ “Send an open letter to all the exiles in Babylon. Tell them, ‘This is
      what the Lord says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Since he has prophesied
      to you when I did not send him and has tricked you into believing his lies, '
    32: ³² I will punish him and his family. None of his descendants will see the
      good things I will do for my people, for he has incited you to rebel against
      me. I, the Lord, have spoken!’”
  30:
    1: '¹ The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Write down for the record
      everything I have said to you, Jeremiah. '
    3: "³ For the time is coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people of\
      \ Israel and Judah. I will bring them home to this land that I gave to their\
      \ ancestors, and they will possess it again. I, the Lord, have spoken!” \n"
    4: '⁴ This is the message the Lord gave concerning Israel and Judah. '
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“I hear cries of fear;\n    there is terror\
      \ and no peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Now let me ask you a question:\n    Do men give birth to babies?\nThen why\
      \ do they stand there, ashen-faced,\n    hands pressed against their sides\n\
      \    like a woman in labor?\n"
    7: "⁷ In all history there has never been such a time of terror.\n    It will\
      \ be a time of trouble for my people Israel.\n    Yet in the end they will be\
      \ saved!\n"
    8: "⁸ For in that day,”\n    says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n“I will break\
      \ the yoke from their necks\n    and snap their chains.\nForeigners will no\
      \ longer be their masters.\n"
    9: "⁹     For my people will serve the Lord their God\nand their king descended\
      \ from David—\n    the king I will raise up for them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “So do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant;\n    do not be dismayed, Israel,”\n\
      \    says the Lord.\n“For I will bring you home again from distant lands,\n\
      \    and your children will return from their exile.\nIsrael will return to\
      \ a life of peace and quiet,\n    and no one will terrorize them.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with you and will save you,”\n    says the Lord.\n“I will completely\
      \ destroy the nations where I have scattered you,\n    but I will not completely\
      \ destroy you.\nI will discipline you, but with justice;\n    I cannot let you\
      \ go unpunished.” \n"
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“Your injury is incurable—\n    a terrible\
      \ wound.\n"
    13: "¹³ There is no one to help you\n    or to bind up your injury.\n    No medicine\
      \ can heal you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your lovers—your allies—have left you\n    and do not care about you\
      \ anymore.\nI have wounded you cruelly,\n    as though I were your enemy.\n\
      For your sins are many,\n    and your guilt is great.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you protest your punishment—\n    this wound that has no cure?\n\
      I have had to punish you\n    because your sins are many\n    and your guilt\
      \ is great. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “But all who devour you will be devoured,\n    and all your enemies will\
      \ be sent into exile.\nAll who plunder you will be plundered,\n    and all who\
      \ attack you will be attacked.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I will give you back your health\n    and heal your wounds,” says the\
      \ Lord.\n“For you are called an outcast—\n    ‘Jerusalem for whom no one cares.’”\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ This is what the Lord says:\n“When I bring Israel home again from captivity\n\
      \    and restore their fortunes,\nJerusalem will be rebuilt on its ruins,\n\
      \    and the palace reconstructed as before.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ There will be joy and songs of thanksgiving,\n    and I will multiply\
      \ my people, not diminish them;\nI will honor them, not despise them.\n"
    20: "²⁰     Their children will prosper as they did long ago.\nI will establish\
      \ them as a nation before me,\n    and I will punish anyone who hurts them.\n"
    21: "²¹ They will have their own ruler again,\n    and he will come from their\
      \ own people.\nI will invite him to approach me,” says the Lord,\n    “for who\
      \ would dare to come unless invited?\n"
    22: "²² You will be my people,\n    and I will be your God.” \n"
    23: "²³ Look! The Lord’s anger bursts out like a storm,\n    a driving wind that\
      \ swirls down on the heads of the wicked.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The fierce anger of the Lord will not diminish\n    until it has finished\
      \ all he has planned.\nIn the days to come\n    you will understand all this."
  31:
    1: '¹ “In that day,” says the Lord, “I will be the God of all the families of
      Israel, and they will be my people. '
    2: "² This is what the Lord says:\n“Those who survive the coming destruction\n\
      \    will find blessings even in the barren land,\n    for I will give rest\
      \ to the people of Israel.” \n"
    3: "³ Long ago the Lord said to Israel:\n“I have loved you, my people, with an\
      \ everlasting love.\n    With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will rebuild you, my virgin Israel.\n    You will again be happy\n   \
      \ and dance merrily with your tambourines.\n"
    5: "⁵ Again you will plant your vineyards on the mountains of Samaria\n    and\
      \ eat from your own gardens there.\n"
    6: "⁶ The day will come when watchmen will shout\n    from the hill country of\
      \ Ephraim,\n‘Come, let us go up to Jerusalem\n    to worship the Lord our God.’”\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ Now this is what the Lord says:\n“Sing with joy for Israel.\n    Shout for\
      \ the greatest of nations!\nShout out with praise and joy:\n‘Save your people,\
      \ O Lord,\n    the remnant of Israel!’\n"
    8: "⁸ For I will bring them from the north\n    and from the distant corners of\
      \ the earth.\nI will not forget the blind and lame,\n    the expectant mothers\
      \ and women in labor.\n    A great company will return!\n"
    9: "⁹ Tears of joy will stream down their faces,\n    and I will lead them home\
      \ with great care.\nThey will walk beside quiet streams\n    and on smooth paths\
      \ where they will not stumble.\nFor I am Israel’s father,\n    and Ephraim is\
      \ my oldest child. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Listen to this message from the Lord,\n    you nations of the world;\n\
      \    proclaim it in distant coastlands:\nThe Lord, who scattered his people,\n\
      \    will gather them and watch over them\n    as a shepherd does his flock.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the Lord has redeemed Israel\n    from those too strong for them.\n"
    12: "¹² They will come home and sing songs of joy on the heights of Jerusalem.\n\
      \    They will be radiant because of the Lord’s good gifts—\nthe abundant crops\
      \ of grain, new wine, and olive oil,\n    and the healthy flocks and herds.\n\
      Their life will be like a watered garden,\n    and all their sorrows will be\
      \ gone.\n"
    13: "¹³ The young women will dance for joy,\n    and the men—old and young—will\
      \ join in the celebration.\nI will turn their mourning into joy.\n    I will\
      \ comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The priests will enjoy abundance,\n    and my people will feast on my\
      \ good gifts.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is what the Lord says: \n“A cry is heard in Ramah—\n    deep anguish\
      \ and bitter weeping.\nRachel weeps for her children,\n    refusing to be comforted—\n\
      \    for her children are gone.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But now this is what the Lord says:\n“Do not weep any longer,\n    for\
      \ I will reward you,” says the Lord.\n“Your children will come back to you\n\
      \    from the distant land of the enemy.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There is hope for your future,” says the Lord.\n    “Your children will\
      \ come again to their own land.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I have heard Israel saying,\n‘You disciplined me severely,\n    like a\
      \ calf that needs training for the yoke.\nTurn me again to you and restore me,\n\
      \    for you alone are the Lord my God.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I turned away from God,\n    but then I was sorry.\nI kicked myself for\
      \ my stupidity!\n    I was thoroughly ashamed of all I did in my younger days.’\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Is not Israel still my son,\n    my darling child?” says the Lord.\n\
      “I often have to punish him,\n    but I still love him.\nThat’s why I long for\
      \ him\n    and surely will have mercy on him.\n"
    21: "²¹ Set up road signs;\n    put up guideposts.\nMark well the path\n    by\
      \ which you came.\nCome back again, my virgin Israel;\n    return to your towns\
      \ here.\n"
    22: "²² How long will you wander,\n    my wayward daughter?\nFor the Lord will\
      \ cause something new to happen—\n    Israel will embrace her God.” \n"
    23: '²³ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “When
      I bring them back from captivity, the people of Judah and its towns will again
      say, ‘The Lord bless you, O righteous home, O holy mountain!’ '
    24: '²⁴ Townspeople and farmers and shepherds alike will live together in peace
      and happiness. '
    25: "²⁵ For I have given rest to the weary and joy to the sorrowing.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ At this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very sweet. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “The day is coming,” says the Lord, “when I will greatly increase the
      human population and the number of animals here in Israel and Judah. '
    28: "²⁸ In the past I deliberately uprooted and tore down this nation. I overthrew\
      \ it, destroyed it, and brought disaster upon it. But in the future I will just\
      \ as deliberately plant it and build it up. I, the Lord, have spoken! \n"
    29: "²⁹ “The people will no longer quote this proverb:\n‘The parents have eaten\
      \ sour grapes,\n    but their children’s mouths pucker at the taste.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ All people will die for their own sins—those who eat the sour grapes will\
      \ be the ones whose mouths will pucker. \n"
    31: '³¹ “The day is coming,” says the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with
      the people of Israel and Judah. '
    32: "³² This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when\
      \ I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. They broke\
      \ that covenant, though I loved them as a husband loves his wife,” says the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    33: '³³ “But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after
      those days,” says the Lord. “I will put my instructions deep within them, and
      I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my
      people. '
    34: "³⁴ And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to\
      \ teach their relatives, saying, ‘You should know the Lord.’ For everyone, from\
      \ the least to the greatest, will know me already,” says the Lord. “And I will\
      \ forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ It is the Lord who provides the sun to light the day\n    and the moon\
      \ and stars to light the night,\n    and who stirs the sea into roaring waves.\n\
      His name is the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    and this is what he says:\n"
    36: "³⁶ “I am as likely to reject my people Israel\n    as I am to abolish the\
      \ laws of nature!”\n"
    37: "³⁷ This is what the Lord says:\n“Just as the heavens cannot be measured\n\
      \    and the foundations of the earth cannot be explored,\nso I will not consider\
      \ casting them away\n    for the evil they have done.\n    I, the Lord, have\
      \ spoken! \n"
    38: '³⁸ “The day is coming,” says the Lord, “when all Jerusalem will be rebuilt
      for me, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. '
    39: '³⁹ A measuring line will be stretched out over the hill of Gareb and across
      to Goah. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And the entire area—including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley,
      and all the fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the Horse
      Gate—will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be captured or destroyed.”
  32:
    1: '¹ The following message came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of
      the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah. This was also the eighteenth year of the
      reign of King Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: '² Jerusalem was then under siege from the Babylonian army, and Jeremiah was
      imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. '
    3: '³ King Zedekiah had put him there, asking why he kept giving this prophecy:
      “This is what the Lord says: ‘I am about to hand this city over to the king
      of Babylon, and he will take it. '
    4: '⁴ King Zedekiah will be captured by the Babylonians and taken to meet the
      king of Babylon face to face. '
    5: "⁵ He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and I will deal with him there,’ says\
      \ the Lord. ‘If you fight against the Babylonians, you will never succeed.’”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ At that time the Lord sent me a message. He said, '
    7: "⁷ “Your cousin Hanamel son of Shallum will come and say to you, ‘Buy my field\
      \ at Anathoth. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone\
      \ else.’” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then, just as the Lord had said he would, my cousin Hanamel came and visited\
      \ me in the prison. He said, “Please buy my field at Anathoth in the land of\
      \ Benjamin. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone\
      \ else, so buy it for yourself.” Then I knew that the message I had heard was\
      \ from the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ So I bought the field at Anathoth, paying Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver
      for it. '
    10: '¹⁰ I signed and sealed the deed of purchase before witnesses, weighed out
      the silver, and paid him. '
    11: '¹¹ Then I took the sealed deed and an unsealed copy of the deed, which contained
      the terms and conditions of the purchase, '
    12: "¹² and I handed them to Baruch son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I\
      \ did all this in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed\
      \ the deed, and all the men of Judah who were there in the courtyard of the\
      \ guardhouse. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then I said to Baruch as they all listened, '
    14: '¹⁴ “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Take
      both this sealed deed and the unsealed copy, and put them into a pottery jar
      to preserve them for a long time.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ For this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says:\
      \ ‘Someday people will again own property here in this land and will buy and\
      \ sell houses and vineyards and fields.’” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then after I had given the papers to Baruch, I prayed to the Lord: \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “O Sovereign Lord! You made the heavens and earth by your strong hand
      and powerful arm. Nothing is too hard for you! '
    18: '¹⁸ You show unfailing love to thousands, but you also bring the consequences
      of one generation’s sin upon the next. You are the great and powerful God, the
      Lord of Heaven’s Armies. '
    19: '¹⁹ You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles. You see the conduct
      of all people, and you give them what they deserve. '
    20: "²⁰ You performed miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt—things\
      \ still remembered to this day! And you have continued to do great miracles\
      \ in Israel and all around the world. You have made your name famous to this\
      \ day. \n"
    21: '²¹ “You brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty signs and wonders, with a
      strong hand and powerful arm, and with overwhelming terror. '
    22: '²² You gave the people of Israel this land that you had promised their ancestors
      long before—a land flowing with milk and honey. '
    23: "²³ Our ancestors came and conquered it and lived in it, but they refused\
      \ to obey you or follow your word. They have not done anything you commanded.\
      \ That is why you have sent this terrible disaster upon them. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “See how the siege ramps have been built against the city walls! Through
      war, famine, and disease, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who
      will conquer it. Everything has happened just as you said. '
    25: "²⁵ And yet, O Sovereign Lord, you have told me to buy the field—paying good\
      \ money for it before these witnesses—even though the city will soon be handed\
      \ over to the Babylonians.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    27: '²⁷ “I am the Lord, the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too
      hard for me? '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I will hand this city over to the
      Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he will capture it. '
    29: '²⁹ The Babylonians outside the walls will come in and set fire to the city.
      They will burn down all these houses where the people provoked my anger by burning
      incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out liquid offerings to other
      gods. '
    30: '³⁰ Israel and Judah have done nothing but wrong since their earliest days.
      They have infuriated me with all their evil deeds,” says the Lord. '
    31: "³¹ “From the time this city was built until now, it has done nothing but\
      \ anger me, so I am determined to get rid of it. \n"
    32: '³² “The sins of Israel and Judah—the sins of the people of Jerusalem, the
      kings, the officials, the priests, and the prophets—have stirred up my anger. '
    33: '³³ My people have turned their backs on me and have refused to return. Even
      though I diligently taught them, they would not receive instruction or obey. '
    34: '³⁴ They have set up their abominable idols right in my own Temple, defiling
      it. '
    35: "³⁵ They have built pagan shrines to Baal in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and\
      \ there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech. I have never commanded\
      \ such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing.\
      \ What an incredible evil, causing Judah to sin so greatly! \n"
    36: '³⁶ “Now I want to say something more about this city. You have been saying,
      ‘It will fall to the king of Babylon through war, famine, and disease.’ But
      this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: '
    37: '³⁷ I will certainly bring my people back again from all the countries where
      I will scatter them in my fury. I will bring them back to this very city and
      let them live in peace and safety. '
    38: '³⁸ They will be my people, and I will be their God. '
    39: '³⁹ And I will give them one heart and one purpose: to worship me forever,
      for their own good and for the good of all their descendants. '
    40: '⁴⁰ And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing
      good for them. I will put a desire in their hearts to worship me, and they will
      never leave me. '
    41: "⁴¹ I will find joy doing good for them and will faithfully and wholeheartedly\
      \ replant them in this land. \n"
    42: '⁴² “This is what the Lord says: Just as I have brought all these calamities
      on them, so I will do all the good I have promised them. '
    43: '⁴³ Fields will again be bought and sold in this land about which you now
      say, ‘It has been ravaged by the Babylonians, a desolate land where people and
      animals have all disappeared.’ '
    44: ⁴⁴ Yes, fields will once again be bought and sold—deeds signed and sealed
      and witnessed—in the land of Benjamin and here in Jerusalem, in the towns of
      Judah and in the hill country, in the foothills of Judah and in the Negev, too.
      For someday I will restore prosperity to them. I, the Lord, have spoken!”
  33:
    1: '¹ While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the Lord
      gave him this second message: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says—the Lord who made the earth, who formed and
      established it, whose name is the Lord: '
    3: '³ Ask me and I will tell you remarkable secrets you do not know about things
      to come. '
    4: '⁴ For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: You have torn down the
      houses of this city and even the king’s palace to get materials to strengthen
      the walls against the siege ramps and swords of the enemy. '
    5: "⁵ You expect to fight the Babylonians, but the men of this city are already\
      \ as good as dead, for I have determined to destroy them in my terrible anger.\
      \ I have abandoned them because of all their wickedness. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Nevertheless, the time will come when I will heal Jerusalem’s wounds and
      give it prosperity and true peace. '
    7: '⁷ I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild their towns. '
    8: '⁸ I will cleanse them of their sins against me and forgive all their sins
      of rebellion. '
    9: "⁹ Then this city will bring me joy, glory, and honor before all the nations\
      \ of the earth! The people of the world will see all the good I do for my people,\
      \ and they will tremble with awe at the peace and prosperity I provide for them.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “This is what the Lord says: You have said, ‘This is a desolate land where
      people and animals have all disappeared.’ Yet in the empty streets of Jerusalem
      and Judah’s other towns, there will be heard once more '
    11: "¹¹ the sounds of joy and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides\
      \ will be heard again, along with the joyous songs of people bringing thanksgiving\
      \ offerings to the Lord. They will sing,\n‘Give thanks to the Lord of Heaven’s\
      \ Armies,\n    for the Lord is good.\n    His faithful love endures forever!’\n\
      For I will restore the prosperity of this land to what it was in the past, says\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says: This land—though it is
      now desolate and has no people and animals—will once more have pastures where
      shepherds can lead their flocks. '
    13: "¹³ Once again shepherds will count their flocks in the towns of the hill\
      \ country, the foothills of Judah, the Negev, the land of Benjamin, the vicinity\
      \ of Jerusalem, and all the towns of Judah. I, the Lord, have spoken! \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “The day will come, says the Lord, when I will do for Israel and Judah\
      \ all the good things I have promised them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “In those days and at that time\n    I will raise up a righteous descendant\
      \ from King David’s line.\n    He will do what is just and right throughout\
      \ the land.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ In that day Judah will be saved,\n    and Jerusalem will live in safety.\n\
      And this will be its name:\n    ‘The Lord Is Our Righteousness.’ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ For this is what the Lord says: David will have a descendant sitting on
      the throne of Israel forever. '
    18: "¹⁸ And there will always be Levitical priests to offer burnt offerings and\
      \ grain offerings and sacrifices to me.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    20: '²⁰ “This is what the Lord says: If you can break my covenant with the day
      and the night so that one does not follow the other, '
    21: '²¹ only then will my covenant with my servant David be broken. Only then
      will he no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. The same is true
      for my covenant with the Levitical priests who minister before me. '
    22: "²² And as the stars of the sky cannot be counted and the sand on the seashore\
      \ cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of my servant David\
      \ and the Levites who minister before me.” \n"
    23: '²³ The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, '
    24: '²⁴ “Have you noticed what people are saying?—‘The Lord chose Judah and Israel
      and then abandoned them!’ They are sneering and saying that Israel is not worthy
      to be counted as a nation. '
    25: '²⁵ But this is what the Lord says: I would no more reject my people than
      I would change my laws that govern night and day, earth and sky. '
    26: ²⁶ I will never abandon the descendants of Jacob or David, my servant, or
      change the plan that David’s descendants will rule the descendants of Abraham,
      Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore them to their land and have mercy
      on them.”
  34:
    1: '¹ King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all the armies from the kingdoms
      he ruled, and he fought against Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. At that time
      this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² “Go to King Zedekiah of Judah, and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord, the
      God of Israel, says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon,
      and he will burn it down. '
    3: "³ You will not escape his grasp but will be captured and taken to meet the\
      \ king of Babylon face to face. Then you will be exiled to Babylon. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘But listen to this promise from the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah. This
      is what the Lord says: You will not be killed in war '
    5: "⁵ but will die peacefully. People will burn incense in your memory, just as\
      \ they did for your ancestors, the kings who preceded you. They will mourn for\
      \ you, crying, “Alas, our master is dead!” This I have decreed, says the Lord.’”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ So Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah. '
    7: "⁷ At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah—the\
      \ only fortified cities of Judah not yet captured. \n"
    8: '⁸ This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah made a covenant
      with the people, proclaiming freedom for the slaves. '
    9: '⁹ He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves—both men and women.
      No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage. '
    10: '¹⁰ The officials and all the people had obeyed the king’s command, '
    11: "¹¹ but later they changed their minds. They took back the men and women they\
      \ had freed, forcing them to be slaves again. \n"
    12: '¹² So the Lord gave them this message through Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with
      your ancestors long ago when I rescued them from their slavery in Egypt. '
    14: '¹⁴ I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years.
      But your ancestors paid no attention to me. '
    15: '¹⁵ Recently you repented and did what was right, following my command. You
      freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in the Temple that bears
      my name. '
    16: "¹⁶ But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking\
      \ back the men and women you had freed, forcing them to be slaves once again.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Since you have not obeyed me by
      setting your countrymen free, I will set you free to be destroyed by war, disease,
      and famine. You will be an object of horror to all the nations of the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ Because you have broken the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart
      just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize
      your vows. '
    19: '¹⁹ Yes, I will cut you apart, whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem,
      court officials, priests, or common people—for you have broken your oath. '
    20: "²⁰ I will give you to your enemies, and they will kill you. Your bodies will\
      \ be food for the vultures and wild animals. \n"
    21: '²¹ “I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army
      of the king of Babylon. And although they have left Jerusalem for a while, '
    22: ²² I will call the Babylonian armies back again. They will fight against this
      city and will capture it and burn it down. I will see to it that all the towns
      of Judah are destroyed, with no one living there.”
  35:
    1: '¹ This is the message the Lord gave Jeremiah when Jehoiakim son of Josiah
      was king of Judah: '
    2: "² “Go to the settlement where the families of the Recabites live, and invite\
      \ them to the Lord’s Temple. Take them into one of the inner rooms, and offer\
      \ them some wine.” \n"
    3: '³ So I went to see Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah and grandson of Habazziniah and
      all his brothers and sons—representing all the Recabite families. '
    4: "⁴ I took them to the Temple, and we went into the room assigned to the sons\
      \ of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was located next to the\
      \ one used by the Temple officials, directly above the room of Maaseiah son\
      \ of Shallum, the Temple gatekeeper. \n"
    5: '⁵ I set cups and jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink, '
    6: '⁶ but they refused. “No,” they said, “we don’t drink wine, because our ancestor
      Jehonadab son of Recab gave us this command: ‘You and your descendants must
      never drink wine. '
    7: '⁷ And do not build houses or plant crops or vineyards, but always live in
      tents. If you follow these commands, you will live long, good lives in the land.’ '
    8: '⁸ So we have obeyed him in all these things. We have never had a drink of
      wine to this day, nor have our wives, our sons, or our daughters. '
    9: '⁹ We haven’t built houses or owned vineyards or farms or planted crops. '
    10: '¹⁰ We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed all the commands of Jehonadab,
      our ancestor. '
    11: "¹¹ But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked this country, we were\
      \ afraid of the Babylonian and Syrian armies. So we decided to move to Jerusalem.\
      \ That is why we are here.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: Go
      and say to the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Come and learn a lesson about
      how to obey me. '
    14: '¹⁴ The Recabites do not drink wine to this day because their ancestor Jehonadab
      told them not to. But I have spoken to you again and again, and you refuse to
      obey me. '
    15: '¹⁵ Time after time I sent you prophets, who told you, “Turn from your wicked
      ways, and start doing things right. Stop worshiping other gods so that you might
      live in peace here in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But
      you would not listen to me or obey me. '
    16: "¹⁶ The descendants of Jehonadab son of Recab have obeyed their ancestor completely,\
      \ but you have refused to listen to me.’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,\
      \ says: ‘Because you refuse to listen or answer when I call, I will send upon\
      \ Judah and Jerusalem all the disasters I have threatened.’” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jeremiah turned to the Recabites and said, “This is what the Lord
      of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed your ancestor
      Jehonadab in every respect, following all his instructions.’ '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,
      says: ‘Jehonadab son of Recab will always have descendants who serve me.’”'
  36:
    1: '¹ During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king in Judah, the
      Lord gave this message to Jeremiah: '
    2: '² “Get a scroll, and write down all my messages against Israel, Judah, and
      the other nations. Begin with the first message back in the days of Josiah,
      and write down every message, right up to the present time. '
    3: "³ Perhaps the people of Judah will repent when they hear again all the terrible\
      \ things I have planned for them. Then I will be able to forgive their sins\
      \ and wrongdoings.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Jeremiah sent for Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated all
      the prophecies that the Lord had given him, Baruch wrote them on a scroll. '
    5: '⁵ Then Jeremiah said to Baruch, “I am a prisoner here and unable to go to
      the Temple. '
    6: '⁶ So you go to the Temple on the next day of fasting, and read the messages
      from the Lord that I have had you write on this scroll. Read them so the people
      who are there from all over Judah will hear them. '
    7: "⁷ Perhaps even yet they will turn from their evil ways and ask the Lord’s\
      \ forgiveness before it is too late. For the Lord has threatened them with his\
      \ terrible anger.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Baruch did as Jeremiah told him and read these messages from the Lord to
      the people at the Temple. '
    9: '⁹ He did this on a day of sacred fasting held in late autumn, during the fifth
      year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah. People from all over Judah had
      come to Jerusalem to attend the services at the Temple on that day. '
    10: "¹⁰ Baruch read Jeremiah’s words on the scroll to all the people. He stood\
      \ in front of the Temple room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the secretary. This\
      \ room was just off the upper courtyard of the Temple, near the New Gate entrance.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Micaiah son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan heard the messages
      from the Lord, '
    12: '¹² he went down to the secretary’s room in the palace where the administrative
      officials were meeting. Elishama the secretary was there, along with Delaiah
      son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son
      of Hananiah, and all the other officials. '
    13: '¹³ When Micaiah told them about the messages Baruch was reading to the people, '
    14: '¹⁴ the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah and
      great-grandson of Cushi, to ask Baruch to come and read the messages to them,
      too. So Baruch took the scroll and went to them. '
    15: "¹⁵ “Sit down and read the scroll to us,” the officials said, and Baruch did\
      \ as they requested. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When they heard all the messages, they looked at one another in alarm.
      “We must tell the king what we have heard,” they said to Baruch. '
    17: "¹⁷ “But first, tell us how you got these messages. Did they come directly\
      \ from Jeremiah?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ So Baruch explained, “Jeremiah dictated them, and I wrote them down in\
      \ ink, word for word, on this scroll.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “You and Jeremiah should both hide,” the officials told Baruch. “Don’t
      tell anyone where you are!” '
    20: "²⁰ Then the officials left the scroll for safekeeping in the room of Elishama\
      \ the secretary and went to tell the king what had happened. \n"
    21: '²¹ The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought it from Elishama’s
      room and read it to the king as all his officials stood by. '
    22: '²² It was late autumn, and the king was in a winterized part of the palace,
      sitting in front of a fire to keep warm. '
    23: '²³ Each time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king took
      a knife and cut off that section of the scroll. He then threw it into the fire,
      section by section, until the whole scroll was burned up. '
    24: '²⁴ Neither the king nor his attendants showed any signs of fear or repentance
      at what they heard. '
    25: "²⁵ Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn\
      \ the scroll, he wouldn’t listen. \n"
    26: "²⁶ Then the king commanded his son Jerahmeel, Seraiah son of Azriel, and\
      \ Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah. But the Lord had hidden\
      \ them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ After the king had burned the scroll on which Baruch had written Jeremiah’s
      words, the Lord gave Jeremiah another message. He said, '
    28: '²⁸ “Get another scroll, and write everything again just as you did on the
      scroll King Jehoiakim burned. '
    29: '²⁹ Then say to the king, ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned the scroll
      because it said the king of Babylon would destroy this land and empty it of
      people and animals. '
    30: '³⁰ Now this is what the Lord says about King Jehoiakim of Judah: He will
      have no heirs to sit on the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out
      to lie unburied—exposed to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. '
    31: "³¹ I will punish him and his family and his attendants for their sins. I\
      \ will pour out on them and on all the people of Jerusalem and Judah all the\
      \ disasters I promised, for they would not listen to my warnings.’” \n"
    32: ³² So Jeremiah took another scroll and dictated again to his secretary, Baruch.
      He wrote everything that had been on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned in
      the fire. Only this time he added much more!
  37:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim as the king
      of Judah. He was appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. '
    2: "² But neither King Zedekiah nor his attendants nor the people who were left\
      \ in the land listened to what the Lord said through Jeremiah. \n"
    3: '³ Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah
      the priest, son of Maaseiah, to ask Jeremiah, “Please pray to the Lord our God
      for us.” '
    4: "⁴ Jeremiah had not yet been imprisoned, so he could come and go among the\
      \ people as he pleased. \n"
    5: "⁵ At this time the army of Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt appeared at the southern\
      \ border of Judah. When the Babylonian army heard about it, they withdrew from\
      \ their siege of Jerusalem. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah: '
    7: '⁷ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: The king of Judah sent
      you to ask me what is going to happen. Tell him, ‘Pharaoh’s army is about to
      return to Egypt, though he came here to help you. '
    8: "⁸ Then the Babylonians will come back and capture this city and burn it to\
      \ the ground.’ \n"
    9: '⁹ “This is what the Lord says: Do not fool yourselves into thinking that the
      Babylonians are gone for good. They aren’t! '
    10: "¹⁰ Even if you were to destroy the entire Babylonian army, leaving only a\
      \ handful of wounded survivors, they would still stagger from their tents and\
      \ burn this city to the ground!” \n"
    11: '¹¹ When the Babylonian army left Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s approaching
      army, '
    12: '¹² Jeremiah started to leave the city on his way to the territory of Benjamin,
      to claim his share of the property among his relatives there. '
    13: "¹³ But as he was walking through the Benjamin Gate, a sentry arrested him\
      \ and said, “You are defecting to the Babylonians!” The sentry making the arrest\
      \ was Irijah son of Shelemiah, grandson of Hananiah. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “That’s not true!” Jeremiah protested. “I had no intention of doing any
      such thing.” But Irijah wouldn’t listen, and he took Jeremiah before the officials. '
    15: '¹⁵ They were furious with Jeremiah and had him flogged and imprisoned in
      the house of Jonathan the secretary. Jonathan’s house had been converted into
      a prison. '
    16: "¹⁶ Jeremiah was put into a dungeon cell, where he remained for many days.\
      \ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Later King Zedekiah secretly requested that Jeremiah come to the palace,\
      \ where the king asked him, “Do you have any messages from the Lord?”\n“Yes,\
      \ I do!” said Jeremiah. “You will be defeated by the king of Babylon.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jeremiah asked the king, “What crime have I committed? What have
      I done against you, your attendants, or the people that I should be imprisoned
      like this? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are your prophets now who told you the king of Babylon would not
      attack you or this land? '
    20: "²⁰ Listen, my lord the king, I beg you. Don’t send me back to the dungeon\
      \ in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for I will die there.” \n"
    21: ²¹ So King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah not be returned to the dungeon.
      Instead, he was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace.
      The king also commanded that Jeremiah be given a loaf of fresh bread every day
      as long as there was any left in the city. So Jeremiah was put in the palace
      prison.
  38:
    1: '¹ Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah,
      and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah had been telling the people.
      He had been saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says: ‘Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from
      war, famine, or disease, but those who surrender to the Babylonians will live.
      Their reward will be life. They will live!’ '
    3: "³ The Lord also says: ‘The city of Jerusalem will certainly be handed over\
      \ to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’” \n"
    4: "⁴ So these officials went to the king and said, “Sir, this man must die! That\
      \ kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few fighting men we have left,\
      \ as well as that of all the people. This man is a traitor!” \n"
    5: "⁵ King Zedekiah agreed. “All right,” he said. “Do as you like. I can’t stop\
      \ you.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So the officials took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into\
      \ an empty cistern in the prison yard. It belonged to Malkijah, a member of\
      \ the royal family. There was no water in the cistern, but there was a thick\
      \ layer of mud at the bottom, and Jeremiah sank down into it. \n"
    7: '⁷ But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an important court official, heard that Jeremiah
      was in the cistern. At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin
      Gate, '
    8: '⁸ so Ebed-melech rushed from the palace to speak with him. '
    9: "⁹ “My lord the king,” he said, “these men have done a very evil thing in putting\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet into the cistern. He will soon die of hunger, for almost\
      \ all the bread in the city is gone.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ So the king told Ebed-melech, “Take thirty of my men with you, and pull\
      \ Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to a room in the palace
      beneath the treasury, where he found some old rags and discarded clothing. He
      carried these to the cistern and lowered them to Jeremiah on a rope. '
    12: '¹² Ebed-melech called down to Jeremiah, “Put these rags under your armpits
      to protect you from the ropes.” Then when Jeremiah was ready, '
    13: "¹³ they pulled him out. So Jeremiah was returned to the courtyard of the\
      \ guard—the palace prison—where he remained. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ One day King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the third\
      \ entrance of the Lord’s Temple. “I want to ask you something,” the king said.\
      \ “And don’t try to hide the truth.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Jeremiah said, “If I tell you the truth, you will kill me. And if I give\
      \ you advice, you won’t listen to me anyway.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ So King Zedekiah secretly promised him, “As surely as the Lord our Creator\
      \ lives, I will not kill you or hand you over to the men who want you dead.”\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord God of Heaven’s
      Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the Babylonian officers,
      you and your family will live, and the city will not be burned down. '
    18: "¹⁸ But if you refuse to surrender, you will not escape! This city will be\
      \ handed over to the Babylonians, and they will burn it to the ground.’” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “But I am afraid to surrender,” the king said, “for the Babylonians may\
      \ hand me over to the Judeans who have defected to them. And who knows what\
      \ they will do to me!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Jeremiah replied, “You won’t be handed over to them if you choose to obey
      the Lord. Your life will be spared, and all will go well for you. '
    21: '²¹ But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has revealed to
      me: '
    22: "²² All the women left in your palace will be brought out and given to the\
      \ officers of the Babylonian army. Then the women will taunt you, saying,\n\
      ‘What fine friends you have!\n    They have betrayed and misled you.\nWhen your\
      \ feet sank in the mud,\n    they left you to your fate!’ \n"
    23: "²³ All your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians, and you\
      \ will not escape. You will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city\
      \ will be burned down.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t tell anyone you told me this, or
      you will die! '
    25: '²⁵ My officials may hear that I spoke to you, and they may say, ‘Tell us
      what you and the king were talking about. If you don’t tell us, we will kill
      you.’ '
    26: "²⁶ If this happens, just tell them you begged me not to send you back to\
      \ Jonathan’s dungeon, for fear you would die there.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ Sure enough, it wasn’t long before the king’s officials came to Jeremiah
      and asked him why the king had called for him. But Jeremiah followed the king’s
      instructions, and they left without finding out the truth. No one had overheard
      the conversation between Jeremiah and the king. '
    28: ²⁸ And Jeremiah remained a prisoner in the courtyard of the guard until the
      day Jerusalem was captured.
  39:
    1: '¹ In January of the ninth year of King Zedekiah’s reign, King Nebuchadnezzar
      of Babylon came with his entire army to besiege Jerusalem. '
    2: '² Two and a half years later, on July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s
      reign, a section of the city wall was broken down. '
    3: "³ All the officers of the Babylonian army came in and sat in triumph at the\
      \ Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, and Nebo-sarsekim, a chief officer,\
      \ and Nergal-sharezer, the king’s adviser, and all the other officers of the\
      \ king of Babylon. \n"
    4: "⁴ When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw that the Babylonians\
      \ had broken into the city, they fled. They waited for nightfall and then slipped\
      \ through the gate between the two walls behind the king’s garden and headed\
      \ toward the Jordan Valley. \n"
    5: '⁵ But the Babylonian troops chased them and overtook Zedekiah on the plains
      of Jericho. They captured him and took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon,
      who was at Riblah in the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced
      judgment upon Zedekiah. '
    6: '⁶ The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons at Riblah.
      The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: "⁷ Then he gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains to lead\
      \ him away to Babylon. \n"
    8: '⁸ Meanwhile, the Babylonians burned Jerusalem, including the royal palace
      and the houses of the people, and they tore down the walls of the city. '
    9: '⁹ Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles to Babylon the
      rest of the people who remained in the city, those who had defected to him,
      and everyone else who remained. '
    10: "¹⁰ But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind in the\
      \ land of Judah, and he assigned them to care for the vineyards and fields.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ King Nebuchadnezzar had told Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, to
      find Jeremiah. '
    12: '¹² “See that he isn’t hurt,” he said. “Look after him well, and give him
      anything he wants.” '
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard; Nebushazban, a chief officer;
      Nergal-sharezer, the king’s adviser; and the other officers of Babylon’s king '
    14: "¹⁴ sent messengers to bring Jeremiah out of the prison. They put him under\
      \ the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who took him back\
      \ to his home. So Jeremiah stayed in Judah among his own people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord had given the following message to Jeremiah while he was still
      in prison: '
    16: '¹⁶ “Say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘This is what the Lord of Heaven’s
      Armies, the God of Israel, says: I will do to this city everything I have threatened.
      I will send disaster, not prosperity. You will see its destruction, '
    17: '¹⁷ but I will rescue you from those you fear so much. '
    18: ¹⁸ Because you trusted me, I will give you your life as a reward. I will rescue
      you and keep you safe. I, the Lord, have spoken!’”
  40:
    1: "¹ The Lord gave a message to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the\
      \ guard, had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among\
      \ all the other captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being sent to exile\
      \ in Babylon. \n"
    2: '² The captain of the guard called for Jeremiah and said, “The Lord your God
      has brought this disaster on this land, '
    3: '³ just as he said he would. For these people have sinned against the Lord
      and disobeyed him. That is why it happened. '
    4: '⁴ But I am going to take off your chains and let you go. If you want to come
      with me to Babylon, you are welcome. I will see that you are well cared for.
      But if you don’t want to come, you may stay here. The whole land is before you—go
      wherever you like. '
    5: "⁵ If you decide to stay, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson\
      \ of Shaphan. He has been appointed governor of Judah by the king of Babylon.\
      \ Stay there with the people he rules. But it’s up to you; go wherever you like.”\n\
      Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, gave Jeremiah some food and money\
      \ and let him go. "
    6: "⁶ So Jeremiah returned to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he lived in\
      \ Judah with the few who were still left in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ The leaders of the Judean military groups in the countryside heard that
      the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the
      poor people who were left behind in Judah—the men, women, and children who hadn’t
      been exiled to Babylon. '
    8: "⁸ So they went to see Gedaliah at Mizpah. These included: Ishmael son of Nethaniah,\
      \ Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of\
      \ Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, and all their men.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Gedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonians meant them no harm. “Don’t be
      afraid to serve them. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and all
      will go well for you,” he promised. '
    10: "¹⁰ “As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians\
      \ who come to meet with us. Settle in the towns you have taken, and live off\
      \ the land. Harvest the grapes and summer fruits and olives, and store them\
      \ away.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ When the Judeans in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and the other nearby countries
      heard that the king of Babylon had left a few people in Judah and that Gedaliah
      was the governor, '
    12: "¹² they began to return to Judah from the places to which they had fled.\
      \ They stopped at Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah and then went into the Judean\
      \ countryside to gather a great harvest of grapes and other crops. \n"
    13: '¹³ Soon after this, Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders
      came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. '
    14: "¹⁴ They said to him, “Did you know that Baalis, king of Ammon, has sent Ishmael\
      \ son of Nethaniah to assassinate you?” But Gedaliah refused to believe them.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Later Johanan had a private conference with Gedaliah and volunteered to\
      \ kill Ishmael secretly. “Why should we let him come and murder you?” Johanan\
      \ asked. “What will happen then to the Judeans who have returned? Why should\
      \ the few of us who are still left be scattered and lost?” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah said to Johanan, “I forbid you to do any such thing, for you
      are lying about Ishmael.”
  41:
    1: '¹ But in midautumn of that year, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and grandson of
      Elishama, who was a member of the royal family and had been one of the king’s
      high officials, went to Mizpah with ten men to meet Gedaliah. While they were
      eating together, '
    2: '² Ishmael and his ten men suddenly jumped up, drew their swords, and killed
      Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also killed all the Judeans and the Babylonian soldiers who were\
      \ with Gedaliah at Mizpah. \n"
    4: '⁴ The next day, before anyone had heard about Gedaliah’s murder, '
    5: '⁵ eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria to worship at the Temple
      of the Lord. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves,
      and had brought along grain offerings and frankincense. '
    6: "⁶ Ishmael left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he reached them,\
      \ he said, “Oh, come and see what has happened to Gedaliah!” \n"
    7: '⁷ But as soon as they were all inside the town, Ishmael and his men killed
      all but ten of them and threw their bodies into a cistern. '
    8: '⁸ The other ten had talked Ishmael into letting them go by promising to bring
      him their stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey that they had hidden
      away. '
    9: "⁹ The cistern where Ishmael dumped the bodies of the men he murdered was the\
      \ large one dug by King Asa when he fortified Mizpah to protect himself against\
      \ King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with corpses. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael made captives of the king’s daughters and the other people\
      \ who had been left under Gedaliah’s care in Mizpah by Nebuzaradan, the captain\
      \ of the guard. Taking them with him, he started back toward the land of Ammon.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ But when Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders heard about
      Ishmael’s crimes, '
    12: '¹² they took all their men and set out to stop him. They caught up with him
      at the large pool near Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ The people Ishmael had captured shouted for joy when they saw Johanan
      and the other military leaders. '
    14: '¹⁴ And all the captives from Mizpah escaped and began to help Johanan. '
    15: "¹⁵ Meanwhile, Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan into the\
      \ land of Ammon. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders took all the
      people they had rescued in Gibeon—the soldiers, women, children, and court officials
      whom Ishmael had captured after he killed Gedaliah. '
    17: '¹⁷ They took them all to the village of Geruth-kimham near Bethlehem, where
      they prepared to leave for Egypt. '
    18: ¹⁸ They were afraid of what the Babylonians would do when they heard that
      Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonian king.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then all the military leaders, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah
      son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least to the greatest, approached '
    2: '² Jeremiah the prophet. They said, “Please pray to the Lord your God for us.
      As you can see, we are only a tiny remnant compared to what we were before. '
    3: "³ Pray that the Lord your God will show us what to do and where to go.” \n"
    4: "⁴ “All right,” Jeremiah replied. “I will pray to the Lord your God, as you\
      \ have asked, and I will tell you everything he says. I will hide nothing from\
      \ you.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord your God be a faithful witness
      against us if we refuse to obey whatever he tells us to do! '
    6: "⁶ Whether we like it or not, we will obey the Lord our God to whom we are\
      \ sending you with our plea. For if we obey him, everything will turn out well\
      \ for us.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Ten days later the Lord gave his reply to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ So he called for Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders, and
      for all the people, from the least to the greatest. '
    9: '⁹ He said to them, “You sent me to the Lord, the God of Israel, with your
      request, and this is his reply: '
    10: '¹⁰ ‘Stay here in this land. If you do, I will build you up and not tear you
      down; I will plant you and not uproot you. For I am sorry about all the punishment
      I have had to bring upon you. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not fear the king of Babylon anymore,’ says the Lord. ‘For I am with
      you and will save you and rescue you from his power. '
    12: "¹² I will be merciful to you by making him kind, so he will let you stay\
      \ here in your land.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “But if you refuse to obey the Lord your God, and if you say, ‘We will
      not stay here; '
    14: '¹⁴ instead, we will go to Egypt where we will be free from war, the call
      to arms, and hunger,’ '
    15: '¹⁵ then hear the Lord’s message to the remnant of Judah. This is what the
      Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to
      go to Egypt and live there, '
    16: '¹⁶ the very war and famine you fear will catch up to you, and you will die
      there. '
    17: "¹⁷ That is the fate awaiting every one of you who insists on going to live\
      \ in Egypt. Yes, you will die from war, famine, and disease. None of you will\
      \ escape the disaster I will bring upon you there.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just\
      \ as my anger and fury have been poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so they\
      \ will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. You will be an object of damnation,\
      \ horror, cursing, and mockery. And you will never see your homeland again.’\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Listen, you remnant of Judah. The Lord has told you: ‘Do not go to Egypt!’
      Don’t forget this warning I have given you today. '
    20: '²⁰ For you were not being honest when you sent me to pray to the Lord your
      God for you. You said, ‘Just tell us what the Lord our God says, and we will
      do it!’ '
    21: '²¹ And today I have told you exactly what he said, but you will not obey
      the Lord your God any better now than you have in the past. '
    22: ²² So you can be sure that you will die from war, famine, and disease in Egypt,
      where you insist on going.”
  43:
    1: '¹ When Jeremiah had finished giving this message from the Lord their God to
      all the people, '
    2: '² Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other proud
      men said to Jeremiah, “You lie! The Lord our God hasn’t forbidden us to go to
      Egypt! '
    3: "³ Baruch son of Neriah has convinced you to say this, because he wants us\
      \ to stay here and be killed by the Babylonians or be carried off into exile.”\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ So Johanan and the other military leaders and all the people refused to
      obey the Lord’s command to stay in Judah. '
    5: '⁵ Johanan and the other leaders took with them all the people who had returned
      from the nearby countries to which they had fled. '
    6: '⁶ In the crowd were men, women, and children, the king’s daughters, and all
      those whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah. The
      prophet Jeremiah and Baruch were also included. '
    7: "⁷ The people refused to obey the voice of the Lord and went to Egypt, going\
      \ as far as the city of Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then at Tahpanhes, the Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, '
    9: '⁹ “While the people of Judah are watching, take some large rocks and bury
      them under the pavement stones at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace here in Tahpanhes. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then say to the people of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,
      the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king
      of Babylon, here to Egypt. I will set his throne over these stones that I have
      hidden. He will spread his royal canopy over them. '
    11: '¹¹ And when he comes, he will destroy the land of Egypt. He will bring death
      to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and
      war to those destined for war. '
    12: '¹² He will set fire to the temples of Egypt’s gods; he will burn the temples
      and carry the idols away as plunder. He will pick clean the land of Egypt as
      a shepherd picks fleas from his cloak. And he himself will leave unharmed. '
    13: ¹³ He will break down the sacred pillars standing in the temple of the sun
      in Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of Egypt’s gods.’”
  44:
    1: '¹ This is the message Jeremiah received concerning the Judeans living in northern
      Egypt in the cities of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in southern Egypt
      as well: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: You
      saw the calamity I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. They now
      lie deserted and in ruins. '
    3: "³ They provoked my anger with all their wickedness. They burned incense and\
      \ worshiped other gods—gods that neither they nor you nor any of your ancestors\
      \ had ever even known. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Again and again I sent my servants, the prophets, to plead with them, ‘Don’t
      do these horrible things that I hate so much.’ '
    5: '⁵ But my people would not listen or turn back from their wicked ways. They
      kept on burning incense to these gods. '
    6: "⁶ And so my fury boiled over and fell like fire on the towns of Judah and\
      \ into the streets of Jerusalem, and they are still a desolate ruin today. \n"
    7: '⁷ “And now the Lord God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, asks you: Why
      are you destroying yourselves? For not one of you will survive—not a man, woman,
      or child among you who has come here from Judah, not even the babies in your
      arms. '
    8: '⁸ Why provoke my anger by burning incense to the idols you have made here
      in Egypt? You will only destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of
      cursing and mockery for all the nations of the earth. '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors, the sins of the kings and
      queens of Judah, and the sins you and your wives committed in Judah and Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ To this very hour you have shown no remorse or reverence. No one has chosen\
      \ to follow my word and the decrees I gave to you and your ancestors before\
      \ you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,
      says: I am determined to destroy every one of you! '
    12: '¹² I will take this remnant of Judah—those who were determined to come here
      and live in Egypt—and I will consume them. They will fall here in Egypt, killed
      by war and famine. All will die, from the least to the greatest. They will be
      an object of damnation, horror, cursing, and mockery. '
    13: '¹³ I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem, by war,
      famine, and disease. '
    14: "¹⁴ Of that remnant who fled to Egypt, hoping someday to return to Judah,\
      \ there will be no survivors. Even though they long to return home, only a handful\
      \ will do so.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had
      burned incense to idols—a great crowd of all the Judeans living in northern
      Egypt and southern Egypt—answered Jeremiah, '
    16: '¹⁶ “We will not listen to your messages from the Lord! '
    17: '¹⁷ We will do whatever we want. We will burn incense and pour out liquid
      offerings to the Queen of Heaven just as much as we like—just as we, and our
      ancestors, and our kings and officials have always done in the towns of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem. For in those days we had plenty to eat, and
      we were well off and had no troubles! '
    18: "¹⁸ But ever since we quit burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and stopped\
      \ worshiping her with liquid offerings, we have been in great trouble and have\
      \ been dying from war and famine.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Besides,” the women added, “do you suppose that we were burning incense\
      \ and pouring out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and making cakes\
      \ marked with her image, without our husbands knowing it and helping us? Of\
      \ course not!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah said to all of them, men and women alike, who had given
      him that answer, '
    21: '²¹ “Do you think the Lord did not know that you and your ancestors, your
      kings and officials, and all the people were burning incense to idols in the
      towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? '
    22: '²² It was because the Lord could no longer bear all the disgusting things
      you were doing that he made your land an object of cursing—a desolate ruin without
      inhabitants—as it is today. '
    23: "²³ All these terrible things happened to you because you have burned incense\
      \ to idols and sinned against the Lord. You have refused to obey him and have\
      \ not followed his instructions, his decrees, and his laws.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Jeremiah said to them all, including the women, “Listen to this message
      from the Lord, all you citizens of Judah who live in Egypt. '
    25: "²⁵ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You\
      \ and your wives have said, “We will keep our promises to burn incense and pour\
      \ out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven,” and you have proved by your\
      \ actions that you meant it. So go ahead and carry out your promises and vows\
      \ to her!’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “But listen to this message from the Lord, all you Judeans now living
      in Egypt: ‘I have sworn by my great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that my name will
      no longer be spoken by any of the Judeans in the land of Egypt. None of you
      may invoke my name or use this oath: “As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives.” '
    27: '²⁷ For I will watch over you to bring you disaster and not good. Everyone
      from Judah who is now living in Egypt will suffer war and famine until all of
      you are dead. '
    28: "²⁸ Only a small number will escape death and return to Judah from Egypt.\
      \ Then all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words are true—mine or\
      \ theirs! \n"
    29: '²⁹ “‘And this is the proof I give you,’ says the Lord, ‘that all I have threatened
      will happen to you and that I will punish you here.’ '
    30: '³⁰ This is what the Lord says: ‘I will turn Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt,
      over to his enemies who want to kill him, just as I turned King Zedekiah of
      Judah over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.’”'
  45:
    1: '¹ The prophet Jeremiah gave a message to Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth
      year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, after Baruch had written down
      everything Jeremiah had dictated to him. He said, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: '
    3: "³ You have said, ‘I am overwhelmed with trouble! Haven’t I had enough pain\
      \ already? And now the Lord has added more! I am worn out from sighing and can\

    4: '⁴ “Baruch, this is what the Lord says: ‘I will destroy this nation that I
      built. I will uproot what I planted. '
    5: ⁵ Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don’t do it! I will bring great

    30: "³⁰ Her young men will fall in the streets and die.\n    Her soldiers will\
      \ all be killed,”\n    says the Lord. \n"
    31: "³¹ “See, I am your enemy, you arrogant people,”\n    says the Lord, the Lord\
      \ of Heaven’s Armies.\n“Your day of reckoning has arrived—\n    the day when\
      \ I will punish you.\n"
    32: "³² O land of arrogance, you will stumble and fall,\n    and no one will raise\
      \ you up.\nFor I will light a fire in the cities of Babylon\n    that will burn\
      \ up everything around them.” \n"
    33: "³³ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“The people of Israel\
      \ and Judah have been wronged.\n    Their captors hold them and refuse to let\
      \ them go.\n"
    34: "³⁴ But the one who redeems them is strong.\n    His name is the Lord of Heaven’s\
      \ Armies.\nHe will defend them\n    and give them rest again in Israel.\nBut\
      \ for the people of Babylon\n    there will be no rest! \n"
    35: "³⁵ “The sword of destruction will strike the Babylonians,”\n    says the\
      \ Lord.\n“It will strike the people of Babylon—\n    her officials and wise\
      \ men, too.\n"
    36: "³⁶ The sword will strike her wise counselors,\n    and they will become fools.\n\
      The sword will strike her mightiest warriors,\n    and panic will seize them.\n"
    37: "³⁷ The sword will strike her horses and chariots\n    and her allies from\
      \ other lands,\n    and they will all become like women.\nThe sword will strike\
      \ her treasures,\n    and they all will be plundered.\n"
    38: "³⁸ A drought will strike her water supply,\n    causing it to dry up.\nAnd\
      \ why? Because the whole land is filled with idols,\n    and the people are\
      \ madly in love with them. \n"
    39: "³⁹ “Soon Babylon will be inhabited by desert animals and hyenas.\n    It\
      \ will be a home for owls.\nNever again will people live there;\n    it will\
      \ lie desolate forever.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ I will destroy it as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah\n    and their neighboring\
      \ towns,” says the Lord.\n“No one will live there;\n    no one will inhabit\
      \ it. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Look! A great army is coming from the north.\n    A great nation and\
      \ many kings\n    are rising against you from far-off lands.\n"
    42: "⁴² They are armed with bows and spears.\n    They are cruel and show no mercy.\n\
      As they ride forward on horses,\n    they sound like a roaring sea.\nThey are\
      \ coming in battle formation,\n    planning to destroy you, Babylon.\n"
    43: "⁴³ The king of Babylon has heard reports about the enemy,\n    and he is\
      \ weak with fright.\nPangs of anguish have gripped him,\n    like those of a\
      \ woman in labor. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ “I will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan,\n    leaping\
      \ on the sheep in the pasture.\nI will chase Babylon from its land,\n    and\
      \ I will appoint the leader of my choice.\nFor who is like me, and who can challenge\
      \ me?\n    What ruler can oppose my will?” \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Listen to the Lord’s plans against Babylon\n    and the land of the Babylonians.\n\
      Even the little children will be dragged off like sheep,\n    and their homes\
      \ will be destroyed.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ The earth will shake with the shout, “Babylon has been taken!”\n    and\
      \ its cry of despair will be heard around the world."
  51:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“I will stir up a destroyer against Babylon\n\
      \    and the people of Babylonia.\n"
    2: "² Foreigners will come and winnow her,\n    blowing her away as chaff.\nThey\

    3: "³ Don’t let the archers put on their armor\n    or draw their bows.\nDon’t\
      \ spare even her best soldiers!\n    Let her army be completely destroyed.\n"
    4: "⁴ They will fall dead in the land of the Babylonians,\n    slashed to death\
      \ in her streets.\n"
    5: "⁵ For the Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    has not abandoned Israel and Judah.\n\
      He is still their God,\n    even though their land was filled with sin\n   \
      \ against the Holy One of Israel.” \n"
    6: "⁶ Flee from Babylon! Save yourselves!\n    Don’t get trapped in her punishment!\n\
      It is the Lord’s time for vengeance;\n    he will repay her in full.\n"
    7: "⁷ Babylon has been a gold cup in the Lord’s hands,\n    a cup that made the\
      \ whole earth drunk.\nThe nations drank Babylon’s wine,\n    and it drove them\
      \ all mad.\n"
    8: "⁸ But suddenly Babylon, too, has fallen.\n    Weep for her.\nGive her medicine.\n\
      \    Perhaps she can yet be healed.\n"
    9: "⁹ We would have helped her if we could,\n    but nothing can save her now.\n\
      Let her go; abandon her.\n    Return now to your own land.\nFor her punishment\
      \ reaches to the heavens;\n    it is so great it cannot be measured.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord has vindicated us.\n    Come, let us announce in Jerusalem\n\
      \    everything the Lord our God has done. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Sharpen the arrows!\n    Lift up the shields!\nFor the Lord has inspired\
      \ the kings of the Medes\n    to march against Babylon and destroy her.\nThis\
      \ is his vengeance against those\n    who desecrated his Temple.\n"
    12: "¹² Raise the battle flag against Babylon!\n    Reinforce the guard and station\
      \ the watchmen.\nPrepare an ambush,\n    for the Lord will fulfill all his plans\
      \ against Babylon.\n"
    13: "¹³ You are a city by a great river,\n    a great center of commerce,\nbut\
      \ your end has come.\n    The thread of your life is cut.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord of Heaven’s Armies has taken this vow\n    and has sworn to it\

      \ swarming with locusts,\n    and they will shout in triumph over you.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord made the earth by his power,\n    and he preserves it by his\
      \ wisdom.\nWith his own understanding\n    he stretched out the heavens.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ When he speaks in the thunder,\n    the heavens roar with rain.\nHe causes\
      \ the clouds to rise over the earth.\n    He sends the lightning with the rain\n\
      \    and releases the wind from his storehouses. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!\n    The craftsmen\
      \ are disgraced by the idols they make,\nfor their carefully shaped works are\
      \ a fraud.\n    These idols have no breath or power.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!\n    On the day of reckoning\
      \ they will all be destroyed.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ But the God of Israel is no idol!\n    He is the Creator of everything\

    21: "²¹ With you I will shatter armies—\n    destroying the horse and rider,\n\
      \    the chariot and charioteer.\n"
    22: "²² With you I will shatter men and women,\n    old people and children,\n\
      \    young men and young women.\n"
    23: "²³ With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks,\n    farmers and oxen,\n\

      \ from the heights.\nWhen I am finished,\n    you will be nothing but a heap\
      \ of burnt rubble.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will be desolate forever.\n    Even your stones will never again be\
      \ used for building.\nYou will be completely wiped out,”\n    says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    27: "²⁷ Raise a signal flag to the nations.\n    Sound the battle cry!\nMobilize\
      \ them all against Babylon.\n    Prepare them to fight against her!\nBring out\
      \ the armies of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.\n    Appoint a commander,\n   \
      \ and bring a multitude of horses like swarming locusts!\n"
    28: "²⁸ Bring against her the armies of the nations—\n    led by the kings of\
      \ the Medes\n    and all their captains and officers. \n"
    29: "²⁹ The earth trembles and writhes in pain,\n    for everything the Lord has\
      \ planned against Babylon stands unchanged.\nBabylon will be left desolate without\
      \ a single inhabitant.\n"
    30: "³⁰     Her mightiest warriors no longer fight.\nThey stay in their barracks,\
      \ their courage gone.\n    They have become like women.\nThe invaders have burned\
      \ the houses\n    and broken down the city gates.\n"
    31: "³¹ The news is passed from one runner to the next\n    as the messengers\
      \ hurry to tell the king\n    that his city has been captured.\n"
    32: "³² All the escape routes are blocked.\n    The marshes have been set aflame,\n\
      \    and the army is in a panic. \n"
    33: "³³ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,\n    the God of Israel, says:\n\
      “Babylon is like wheat on a threshing floor,\n    about to be trampled.\nIn\
      \ just a little while\n    her harvest will begin.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ “King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has eaten and crushed us\n    and drained\
      \ us of strength.\nHe has swallowed us like a great monster\n    and filled\
      \ his belly with our riches.\n    He has thrown us out of our own country.\n"
    35: "³⁵ Make Babylon suffer as she made us suffer,”\n    say the people of Zion.\n\
      “Make the people of Babylonia pay for spilling our blood,”\n    says Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    36: "³⁶ This is what the Lord says to Jerusalem: \n“I will be your lawyer to plead\
      \ your case,\n    and I will avenge you.\nI will dry up her river,\n    as well\
      \ as her springs,\n"
    37: "³⁷ and Babylon will become a heap of ruins,\n    haunted by jackals.\nShe\
      \ will be an object of horror and contempt,\n    a place where no one lives.\n"
    38: "³⁸ Her people will roar together like strong lions.\n    They will growl\
      \ like lion cubs.\n"
    39: "³⁹ And while they lie inflamed with all their wine,\n    I will prepare a\
      \ different kind of feast for them.\nI will make them drink until they fall\

    40: "⁴⁰ “I will bring them down\n    like lambs to the slaughter,\n    like rams\

    41: "⁴¹ “How Babylon is fallen—\n    great Babylon, praised throughout the earth!\n\
      Now she has become an object of horror\n    among the nations.\n"
    42: "⁴² The sea has risen over Babylon;\n    she is covered by its crashing waves.\n"
    43: "⁴³ Her cities now lie in ruins;\n    she is a dry wasteland\n    where no\
      \ one lives or even passes by.\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ And I will punish Bel, the god of Babylon,\n    and make him vomit up\
      \ all he has eaten.\nThe nations will no longer come and worship him.\n    The\
      \ wall of Babylon has fallen! \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ “Come out, my people, flee from Babylon.\n    Save yourselves! Run from\
      \ the Lord’s fierce anger.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ But do not panic; don’t be afraid\n    when you hear the first rumor of\
      \ approaching forces.\n    For rumors will keep coming year by year.\nViolence\
      \ will erupt in the land\n    as the leaders fight against each other.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ For the time is surely coming\n    when I will punish this great city\
      \ and all her idols.\nHer whole land will be disgraced,\n    and her dead will\
      \ lie in the streets.\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Then the heavens and earth will rejoice,\n    for out of the north will\
      \ come destroying armies\n    against Babylon,” says the Lord.\n"
    49: "⁴⁹ “Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel\n    and others throughout\
      \ the world,\n    so must her people be killed.\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Get out, all you who have escaped the sword!\n    Do not stand and watch—flee\
      \ while you can!\nRemember the Lord, though you are in a far-off land,\n   \
      \ and think about your home in Jerusalem.” \n"
    51: "⁵¹ “We are ashamed,” the people say.\n    “We are insulted and disgraced\n\
      because the Lord’s Temple\n    has been defiled by foreigners.” \n"
    52: "⁵² “Yes,” says the Lord, “but the time is coming\n    when I will destroy\
      \ Babylon’s idols.\nThe groans of her wounded people\n    will be heard throughout\
      \ the land.\n"
    53: "⁵³ Though Babylon reaches as high as the heavens\n    and makes her fortifications\
      \ incredibly strong,\nI will still send enemies to plunder her.\n    I, the\
      \ Lord, have spoken! \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ “Listen! Hear the cry of Babylon,\n    the sound of great destruction\
      \ from the land of the Babylonians.\n"
    55: "⁵⁵ For the Lord is destroying Babylon.\n    He will silence her loud voice.\n\
      Waves of enemies pound against her;\n    the noise of battle rings through the\
      \ city.\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Destroying armies come against Babylon.\n    Her mighty men are captured,\n\
      \    and their weapons break in their hands.\nFor the Lord is a God who gives\
      \ just punishment;\n    he always repays in full.\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ I will make her officials and wise men drunk,\n    along with her captains,\
      \ officers, and warriors.\nThey will fall asleep\n    and never wake up again!”\n\
      says the King, whose name is\n    the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“The thick walls of Babylon\
      \ will be leveled to the ground,\n    and her massive gates will be burned.\n\
      The builders from many lands have worked in vain,\n    for their work will be\
      \ destroyed by fire!” \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ The prophet Jeremiah gave this message to Seraiah son of Neriah and grandson
      of Mahseiah, a staff officer, when Seraiah went to Babylon with King Zedekiah
      of Judah. This was during the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign. '
    60: '⁶⁰ Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll all the terrible disasters that would
      soon come upon Babylon—all the words written here. '
    61: '⁶¹ He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, read aloud everything on
      this scroll. '
    62: '⁶² Then say, ‘Lord, you have said that you will destroy Babylon so that neither
      people nor animals will remain here. She will lie empty and abandoned forever.’ '
    63: '⁶³ When you have finished reading the scroll, tie it to a stone and throw
      it into the Euphrates River. '
    64: "⁶⁴ Then say, ‘In this same way Babylon and her people will sink, never again\
      \ to rise, because of the disasters I will bring upon her.’”\nThis is the end\
      \ of Jeremiah’s messages."
  52:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in
      Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from
      Libnah. '
    2: '² But Zedekiah did what was evil in the Lord’s sight, just as Jehoiakim had
      done. '
    3: "³ These things happened because of the Lord’s anger against the people of\
      \ Jerusalem and Judah, until he finally banished them from his presence and\
      \ sent them into exile.\nZedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. "
    4: '⁴ So on January 15, during the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, King Nebuchadnezzar
      of Babylon led his entire army against Jerusalem. They surrounded the city and
      built siege ramps against its walls. '
    5: "⁵ Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah’s\
      \ reign. \n"
    6: '⁶ By July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s reign, the famine in the city
      had become very severe, and the last of the food was entirely gone. '
    7: "⁷ Then a section of the city wall was broken down, and all the soldiers fled.\
      \ Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians, they waited for nightfall.\
      \ Then they slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king’s\
      \ garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley. \n"
    8: '⁸ But the Babylonian troops chased King Zedekiah and overtook him on the plains
      of Jericho, for his men had all deserted him and scattered. '
    9: '⁹ They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in
      the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. '
    10: '¹⁰ The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons. He
      also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. '
    11: "¹¹ Then he gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains, and\
      \ the king of Babylon led him away to Babylon. Zedekiah remained there in prison\
      \ until the day of his death. \n"
    12: '¹² On August 17 of that year, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar’s
      reign, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard and an official of the Babylonian
      king, arrived in Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ He burned down the Temple of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the houses
      of Jerusalem. He destroyed all the important buildings in the city. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then he supervised the entire Babylonian army as they tore down the walls
      of Jerusalem on every side. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles some of the
      poorest of the people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the
      defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the
      rest of the craftsmen. '
    16: "¹⁶ But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind to care\
      \ for the vineyards and fields. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the Lord’s Temple,
      the bronze water carts, and the great bronze basin called the Sea, and they
      carried all the bronze away to Babylon. '
    18: '¹⁸ They also took all the ash buckets, shovels, lamp snuffers, basins, dishes,
      and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple. '
    19: "¹⁹ The captain of the guard also took the small bowls, incense burners, basins,\
      \ pots, lampstands, ladles, bowls used for liquid offerings, and all the other\
      \ articles made of pure gold or silver. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The weight of the bronze from the two pillars, the Sea with the twelve
      bronze oxen beneath it, and the water carts was too great to be measured. These
      things had been made for the Lord’s Temple in the days of King Solomon. '
    21: '²¹ Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference. They
      were hollow, with walls 3 inches thick. '
    22: '²² The bronze capital on top of each pillar was 7 1⁄2 feet high and was decorated
      with a network of bronze pomegranates all the way around. '
    23: "²³ There were 96 pomegranates on the sides, and a total of 100 pomegranates\
      \ on the network around the top. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took with him as prisoners Seraiah
      the high priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three chief
      gatekeepers. '
    25: '²⁵ And from among the people still hiding in the city, he took an officer
      who had been in charge of the Judean army; seven of the king’s personal advisers;
      the army commander’s chief secretary, who was in charge of recruitment; and
      sixty other citizens. '
    26: '²⁶ Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them all to the king of Babylon
      at Riblah. '
    27: "²⁷ And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them\
      \ all put to death. So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ The number of captives taken to Babylon in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar’s
      reign was 3,023. '
    29: '²⁹ Then in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year he took 832 more. '
    30: "³⁰ In Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year he sent Nebuzaradan, the captain\
      \ of the guard, who took 745 more—a total of 4,600 captives in all. \n"
    31: '³¹ In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, Evil-merodach
      ascended to the Babylonian throne. He was kind to Jehoiachin and released him
      from prison on March 31 of that year. '
    32: '³² He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the
      other exiled kings in Babylon. '
    33: '³³ He supplied Jehoiachin with new clothes to replace his prison garb and
      allowed him to dine in the king’s presence for the rest of his life. '
    34: ³⁴ So the Babylonian king gave him a regular food allowance as long as he
      lived. This continued until the day of his death.
