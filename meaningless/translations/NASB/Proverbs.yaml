      \ long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing\nAnd fools hate knowledge?\n"

    26: "²⁶ I will also laugh at your disaster;\nI will mock when your dread comes,\n"
    27: "²⁷ When your dread comes like a storm\nAnd your disaster comes like a whirlwind,\n\

    28: "²⁸ Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;\nThey will seek me diligently\
      \ but will not find me,\n"

    2: "² For length of days and years of life\nAnd peace they will add to you.\n"

      \ my commandments and live;\n"
    5: "⁵ Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding!\nDo not forget nor turn away from\
      \ the words of my mouth.\n"
    6: "⁶ Do not abandon her, and she will guard you;\nLove her, and she will watch\

      \ evil people.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Avoid it, do not pass by it;\nTurn away from it and pass on.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For they cannot sleep unless they do evil;\nAnd they are robbed of sleep\

    17: "¹⁷ For they eat the bread of wickedness,\nAnd drink the wine of violence.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn\nThat shines brighter\
      \ and brighter until the full day.\n"

      \ stumble. \n"
    20: "²⁰ My son, pay attention to my words;\nIncline your ear to my sayings.\n"
    21: "²¹ They are not to escape from your sight;\nKeep them in the midst of your\
      \ heart.\n"
    22: "²² For they are life to those who find them,\nAnd healing to all their body.\n"

  5:
    1: "¹ My son, pay attention to my wisdom,\nIncline your ear to my understanding,\n"
    2: "² So that you may maintain discretion\nAnd your lips may comply with knowledge.\n"
    3: "³ For the lips of an adulteress drip honey,\nAnd her speech is smoother than\
      \ oil;\n"
    4: "⁴ But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,\nSharp as a two-edged sword.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her feet go down to death,\nHer steps take hold of Sheol.\n"
    6: "⁶ She does not ponder the path of life;\nHer ways are unstable, she does not\
      \ know it. \n"
    7: "⁷ Now then, my sons, listen to me\nAnd do not turn away from the words of\
      \ my mouth.\n"
    8: "⁸ Keep your way far from her,\nAnd do not go near the door of her house,\n"
    9: "⁹ Otherwise you will give your vigor to others,\nAnd your years to the cruel\
      \ one;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ And strangers will be filled with your strength,\nAnd your hard-earned\
      \ possessions will go to the house of a foreigner;\n"
    11: "¹¹ And you will groan in the end,\nWhen your flesh and your body are consumed;\n"
    12: "¹² And you say, “How I hated instruction!\nAnd my heart disdainfully rejected\
      \ rebuke!\n"
    13: "¹³ I did not listen to the voice of my teachers,\nNor incline my ear to my\
      \ instructors!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I was almost in total ruin\nIn the midst of the assembly and congregation.”\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Drink water from your own cistern,\nAnd fresh water from your own well.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Should your springs overflow into the street,\nStreams of water in the\
      \ public squares?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let them be yours alone,\nAnd not for strangers with you.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Let your fountain be blessed,\nAnd rejoice in the wife of your youth.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Like a loving doe and a graceful mountain goat,\nLet her breasts satisfy\
      \ you at all times;\nBe exhilarated always with her love.\n"
    20: "²⁰ For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress,\nAnd embrace\
      \ the breasts of a foreigner?\n"
    21: "²¹ For the ways of everyone are before the eyes of the Lord,\nAnd He observes\
      \ all his paths.\n"
    22: "²² His own wrongdoings will trap the wicked,\nAnd he will be held by the\
      \ ropes of his sin.\n"
    23: "²³ He will die for lack of instruction,\nAnd in the greatness of his foolishness\
      \ he will go astray."
  6:
    1: "¹ My son, if you have become a guarantor for your neighbor,\nOr have given\
      \ a handshake for a stranger,\n"
    2: "² If you have been ensnared by the words of your mouth,\nOr caught by the\
      \ words of your mouth,\n"
    3: "³ Then do this, my son, and save yourself:\nSince you have come into the hand\
      \ of your neighbor,\nGo, humble yourself, and be urgent with your neighbor to\
      \ free yourself.\n"
    4: "⁴ Give no sleep to your eyes,\nNor slumber to your eyelids;\n"
    5: "⁵ Save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter’s hand,\nAnd like a bird from\
      \ the hand of the fowler. \n"
    6: "⁶ Go to the ant, you lazy one,\nObserve its ways and be wise,\n"
    7: "⁷ Which, having no chief,\nOfficer, or ruler,\n"
    8: "⁸ Prepares its food in the summer\nAnd gathers its provision in the harvest.\n"
    9: "⁹ How long will you lie down, you lazy one?\nWhen will you arise from your\
      \ sleep?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “A little sleep, a little slumber,\nA little folding of the hands to rest,”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then your poverty will come in like a drifter,\nAnd your need like an\
      \ armed man. \n"
    12: "¹² A worthless person, a wicked man,\nIs one who walks with a perverse mouth,\n"
    13: "¹³ Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,\nWho points with his\
      \ fingers;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who, with perversion in his heart, continually devises evil,\nWho spreads\
      \ strife.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore his disaster will come suddenly;\nInstantly he will be broken\
      \ and there will be no healing. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ There are six things that the Lord hates,\nSeven that are an abomination\
      \ to Him:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,\nAnd hands that shed innocent blood,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ A heart that devises wicked plans,\nFeet that run rapidly to evil,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A false witness who declares lies,\nAnd one who spreads strife among brothers.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ My son, comply with the commandment of your father,\nAnd do not ignore\
      \ the teaching of your mother;\n"
    21: "²¹ Bind them continually on your heart;\nTie them around your neck.\n"
    22: "²² When you walk, they will guide you;\nWhen you sleep, they will watch over\
      \ you;\nAnd when you awake, they will talk to you.\n"
    23: "²³ For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light;\nAnd rebukes\
      \ for discipline are the way of life\n"
    24: "²⁴ To keep you from the evil woman,\nFrom the smooth tongue of the foreign\
      \ woman.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not desire her beauty in your heart,\nNor let her capture you with\
      \ her eyelids.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For the price of a prostitute reduces one to a loaf of bread,\nAnd an\
      \ adulteress hunts for a precious life.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Can anyone take fire in his lap\nAnd his clothes not be burned?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Or can a person walk on hot coals\nAnd his feet not be scorched?\n"
    29: "²⁹ So is the one who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;\nWhoever touches her\
      \ will not go unpunished.\n"
    30: "³⁰ People do not despise a thief if he steals\nTo satisfy himself when he\
      \ is hungry;\n"
    31: "³¹ But when he is found, he must repay seven times as much;\nHe must give\
      \ up all the property of his house.\n"
    32: "³² One who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense;\nHe who would\
      \ destroy himself commits it.\n"
    33: "³³ He will find wounds and disgrace,\nAnd his shame will not be removed.\n"
    34: "³⁴ For jealousy enrages a man,\nAnd he will not have compassion on the day\
      \ of vengeance.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He will not accept any settlement,\nNor will he be satisfied though you\
      \ make it a large gift."
  7:
    1: "¹ My son, keep my words\nAnd treasure my commandments within you.\n"
    2: "² Keep my commandments and live,\nAnd my teaching as the apple of your eye.\n"
    3: "³ Bind them on your fingers;\nWrite them on the tablet of your heart.\n"
    4: "⁴ Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”\nAnd call understanding your intimate\
      \ friend,\n"
    5: "⁵ So that they may keep you from an adulteress,\nFrom the foreigner who flatters\
      \ with her words. \n"
    6: "⁶ For at the window of my house\nI looked out through my lattice,\n"
    7: "⁷ And I saw among the naive,\nAnd discerned among the youths\nA young man\
      \ lacking sense,\n"
    8: "⁸ Passing through the street near her corner;\nAnd he walks along the way\
      \ to her house,\n"
    9: "⁹ In the twilight, in the evening,\nIn the middle of the night and the darkness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ And behold, a woman comes to meet him,\nDressed as a prostitute and cunning\
      \ of heart.\n"
    11: "¹¹ She is boisterous and rebellious,\nHer feet do not remain at home;\n"
    12: "¹² She is now in the streets, now in the public squares,\nAnd lurks by every\
      \ corner.\n"
    13: "¹³ So she seizes him and kisses him,\nAnd with a brazen face she says to\
      \ him:\n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I was due to offer peace offerings;\nToday I have paid my vows.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore I have come out to meet you,\nTo seek your presence diligently,\
      \ and I have found you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I have spread my couch with coverings,\nWith colored linens of Egypt.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I have sprinkled my bed\nWith myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Come, let’s drink our fill of love until morning;\nLet’s delight ourselves\
      \ with caresses.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For my husband is not at home;\nHe has gone on a long journey.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He has taken a bag of money with him.\nAt the full moon he will come home.”\n"
    21: "²¹ With her many persuasions she entices him;\nWith her flattering lips she\
      \ seduces him.\n"
    22: "²² Suddenly he follows her\nAs an ox goes to the slaughter,\nOr as one walks\
      \ in ankle bracelets to the discipline of a fool,\n"
    23: "²³ Until an arrow pierces through his liver;\nAs a bird hurries to the snare,\n\
      So he does not know that it will cost him his life. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,\nAnd pay attention to the words\
      \ of my mouth.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,\nDo not stray into her paths.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For many are the victims she has brought to ruin,\nAnd numerous are all\
      \ those slaughtered by her.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Her house is the way to Sheol,\nDescending to the chambers of death."
  8:
    1: "¹ Does not wisdom call,\nAnd understanding raise her voice?\n"
    2: "² On top of the heights beside the way,\nWhere the paths meet, she takes her\
      \ stand;\n"
    3: "³ Beside the gates, at the opening to the city,\nAt the entrance of the doors,\
      \ she cries out:\n"
    4: "⁴ “To you, people, I call,\nAnd my voice is to mankind.\n"
    5: "⁵ You naive ones, understand prudence;\nAnd, you fools, understand wisdom!\n"
    6: "⁶ Listen, for I will speak noble things;\nAnd the opening of my lips will\
      \ reveal right things.\n"
    7: "⁷ For my mouth will proclaim truth;\nAnd wickedness is an abomination to my\
      \ lips.\n"
    8: "⁸ All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;\nThere is nothing crooked\
      \ or perverted in them.\n"
    9: "⁹ They are all straightforward to him who understands,\nAnd right to those\
      \ who find knowledge.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Accept my instruction and not silver,\nAnd knowledge rather than choice\
      \ gold.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For wisdom is better than jewels;\nAnd all desirable things cannot compare\
