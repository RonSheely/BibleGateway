Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which\
      \ he saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Listen, heavens, and hear, earth;\nFor the Lord has spoken:\n“Sons I have\
      \ raised and brought up,\nBut they have revolted against Me.\n"
    3: "³ An ox knows its owner,\nAnd a donkey its master’s manger,\nBut Israel does\
      \ not know,\nMy people do not understand.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Oh, sinful nation,\nPeople weighed down with guilt,\nOffspring of evildoers,\n\
      Sons who act corruptly!\nThey have abandoned the Lord,\nThey have despised the\
      \ Holy One of Israel,\nThey have turned away from Him. \n"
    5: "⁵ Where will you be stricken again,\nAs you continue in your rebellion?\n\
      The entire head is sick\nAnd the entire heart is faint.\n"
    6: "⁶ From the sole of the foot even to the head\nThere is nothing healthy in\
      \ it,\nOnly bruises, slashes, and raw wounds;\nNot pressed out nor bandaged,\n\
      Nor softened with oil. \n"
    7: "⁷ Your land is desolate,\nYour cities are burned with fire;\nAs for your fields,\
      \ strangers are devouring them in front of you;\nIt is desolation, as overthrown\
      \ by strangers.\n"
    8: "⁸ The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,\nLike a watchman’s\
      \ hut in a cucumber field, like a city under watch.\n"
    9: "⁹ If the Lord of armies\nHad not left us a few survivors,\nWe would be like\
      \ Sodom,\nWe would be like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord,\nYou rulers of Sodom;\nListen to the instruction\
      \ of our God,\nYou people of Gomorrah!\n"
    11: "¹¹ “What are your many sacrifices to Me?”\nSays the Lord.\n“I have had enough\
      \ of burnt offerings of rams\nAnd the fat of fattened cattle;\nAnd I take no\
      \ pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.\n"
    12: "¹² When you come to appear before Me,\nWho requires of you this trampling\
      \ of My courtyards?\n"
    13: "¹³ Do not go on bringing your worthless offerings,\nIncense is an abomination\
      \ to Me.\nNew moon and Sabbath, the proclamation of an assembly—\nI cannot endure\
      \ wrongdoing and the festive assembly.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts,\nThey have become\
      \ a burden to Me;\nI am tired of bearing them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So when you spread out your hands in prayer,\nI will hide My eyes from\
      \ you;\nYes, even though you offer many prayers,\nI will not be listening.\n\
      Your hands are covered with blood. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean;\nRemove the evil of your deeds\
      \ from My sight.\nStop doing evil,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Learn to do good;\nSeek justice,\nRebuke the oppressor,\nObtain justice\
      \ for the orphan,\nPlead for the widow’s case. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Come now, and let us debate your case,”\nSays the Lord,\n“Though your\
      \ sins are as scarlet,\nThey shall become as white as snow;\nThough they are\
      \ red like crimson,\nThey shall be like wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you are willing and obedient,\nYou will eat the best of the land;\n"
    20: "²⁰ But if you refuse and rebel,\nYou will be devoured by the sword.”\nFor\
      \ the mouth of the Lord has spoken. \n"
    21: "²¹ How the faithful city has become a prostitute,\nShe who was full of justice!\n\
      Righteousness once dwelt in her,\nBut now murderers.\n"
    22: "²² Your silver has become waste matter,\nYour drink diluted with water.\n"
    23: "²³ Your rulers are rebels\nAnd companions of thieves;\nEveryone loves a bribe\n\
      And chases after gifts.\nThey do not obtain justice for the orphan,\nNor does\
      \ the widow’s case come before them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore the Lord God of armies,\nThe Mighty One of Israel, declares,\n\
      “Ah, I will have satisfaction against My adversaries,\nAnd avenge Myself on\
      \ My enemies.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will also turn My hand against you,\nAnd smelt away your impurities\
      \ as with lye;\nAnd I will remove all your slag.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Then I will restore your judges as at first,\nAnd your counselors as at\
      \ the beginning;\nAfter that you will be called the city of righteousness,\n\
      A faithful city.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion will be redeemed with justice\nAnd her repentant ones with righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But wrongdoers and sinners together will be broken,\nAnd those who abandon\
      \ the Lord will come to an end.\n"
    29: "²⁹ You certainly will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,\nAnd\
      \ you will be embarrassed by the gardens which you have chosen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For you will be like an oak whose leaf withers away,\nOr like a garden\
      \ that has no water.\n"
    31: "³¹ The strong man will become like flax fiber,\nAnd his work a spark.\nSo\
      \ they shall both burn together\nAnd there will be no one to extinguish them."
  2:
    1: "¹ The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² Now it will come about that\nIn the last days\nThe mountain of the house\
      \ of the Lord\nWill be established as the chief of the mountains,\nAnd will\
      \ be raised above the hills;\nAnd all the nations will stream to it.\n"
    3: "³ And many peoples will come and say,\n“Come, let’s go up to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord,\nTo the house of the God of Jacob;\nSo that He may teach us about\
      \ His ways,\nAnd that we may walk in His paths.”\nFor the law will go out from\
      \ Zion\nAnd the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ And He will judge between the nations,\nAnd will mediate for many peoples;\n\
      And they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning\
      \ knives.\nNation will not lift up a sword against nation,\nAnd never again\
      \ will they learn war. \n"
    5: "⁵ Come, house of Jacob, and let’s walk in the light of the Lord.\n"
    6: "⁶ For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob,\nBecause they are\
      \ filled with influences from the east,\nAnd they are soothsayers like the Philistines.\n\
      They also strike bargains with the children of foreigners.\n"
    7: "⁷ Their land has also been filled with silver and gold\nAnd there is no end\
      \ to their treasures;\nTheir land has also been filled with horses,\nAnd there\
      \ is no end to their chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land has also been filled with idols;\nThey worship the work of their\
      \ hands,\nThat which their fingers have made.\n"
    9: "⁹ So the common person has been humbled\nAnd the person of importance has\
      \ been brought low,\nBut do not forgive them.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Enter the rocky place and hide in the dust\nFrom the terror of the Lord\
      \ and from the splendor of His majesty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The proud look of humanity will be brought low,\nAnd the arrogance of\
      \ people will be humbled;\nAnd the Lord alone will be exalted on that day. \n"
    12: "¹² For the Lord of armies will have a day of reckoning\nAgainst everyone\
      \ who is arrogant and haughty,\nAnd against everyone who is lifted up,\nThat\
      \ he may be brought low.\n"
    13: "¹³ And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted\
      \ up,\nAgainst all the oaks of Bashan,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Against all the lofty mountains,\nAgainst all the hills that are lifted\
      \ up,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Against every high tower,\nAgainst every fortified wall,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Against all the ships of Tarshish\nAnd against all the delightful ships.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the pride of humanity will be humbled\nAnd the arrogance of people\
      \ will be brought low;\nAnd the Lord alone will be exalted on that day,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ And the idols will completely vanish.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ People will go into caves of the rocks\nAnd into holes in the ground\n\
      Away from the terror of the Lord\nAnd the splendor of His majesty,\nWhen He\
      \ arises to terrify the earth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ On that day people will throw away to the moles and the bats\nTheir idols\
      \ of silver and their idols of gold,\nWhich they made for themselves to worship,\n"
    21: "²¹ In order to go into the clefts of the rocks and the crannies of the cliffs\n\
      Before the terror of the Lord and the splendor of His majesty,\nWhen He arises\
      \ to terrify the earth.\n"
    22: "²² Take no account of man, whose breath of life is in his nostrils;\nFor\
      \ why should he be esteemed?"
  3:
    1: "¹ For behold, the Lord God of armies is going to remove from Jerusalem and\
      \ Judah\nBoth supply and support, the entire supply of bread\nAnd the entire\
      \ supply of water;\n"
    2: "² The mighty man and the warrior,\nThe judge and the prophet,\nThe diviner\
      \ and the elder,\n"
    3: "³ The captain of fifty and the esteemed person,\nThe counselor and the expert\
      \ artisan,\nAnd the skillful enchanter.\n"
    4: "⁴ And I will make mere boys their leaders,\nAnd mischievous children will\
      \ rule over them,\n"
    5: "⁵ And the people will be oppressed,\nEach one by another, and each one by\
      \ his neighbor;\nThe youth will assault the elder,\nAnd the contemptible person\
      \ will assault the one honored.\n"
    6: "⁶ When a man lays hold of his brother in his father’s house, saying,\n“You\
      \ have a cloak, you shall be our ruler!\nAnd these ruins will be under your\
      \ authority,”\n"
    7: "⁷ He will protest on that day, saying,\n“I will not be your healer,\nFor in\
      \ my house there is neither bread nor cloak;\nYou should not appoint me ruler\
      \ of the people.”\n"
    8: "⁸ For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen,\nBecause their speech and\
      \ their actions are against the Lord,\nTo rebel against His glorious presence.\n"
    9: "⁹ The expression of their faces testifies against them,\nAnd they display\
      \ their sin like Sodom;\nThey do not even conceal it.\nWoe to them!\nFor they\
      \ have done evil to themselves.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Say to the righteous that it will go well for them,\nFor they will eat\
      \ the fruit of their actions.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to the wicked! It will go badly for him,\nFor what he deserves will\
      \ be done to him.\n"
    12: "¹² My people! Their oppressors treat them violently,\nAnd women rule over\
      \ them.\nMy people! Those who guide you lead you astray\nAnd confuse the direction\
      \ of your paths. \n"
    13: "¹³ The Lord arises to contend,\nAnd stands to judge the people.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and leaders of His people,\n\
      “It is you who have devoured the vineyard;\nThe goods stolen from the poor are\
      \ in your houses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ What do you mean by crushing My people\nAnd oppressing the face of the\
      \ poor?”\nDeclares the Lord God of armies. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Moreover, the Lord said, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty\n\
      And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes,\nAnd go along with mincing\
      \ steps\nAnd jingle the anklets on their feet,\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs,\n\
      And the Lord will make their foreheads bare.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ On that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands,
      crescent ornaments, '
    19: '¹⁹ dangling earrings, bracelets, veils, '
    20: '²⁰ headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, '
    21: '²¹ finger rings, nose rings, '
    22: '²² festive robes, outer garments, shawls, purses, '
    23: "²³ papyrus garments, undergarments, headbands, and veils. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Now it will come about that instead of balsam oil there will be a stench;\n\
      Instead of a belt, a rope;\nInstead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp;\n\
      Instead of fine clothes, a robe of sackcloth;\nAnd branding instead of beauty.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your men will fall by the sword\nAnd your mighty ones in battle.\n"
    26: "²⁶ And her gates will lament and mourn,\nAnd she will sit deserted on the\
      \ ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ For seven women will take hold of one man on that day, saying, “We will\
      \ eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your\
      \ name; take away our disgrace!” \n"
    2: '² On that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the
      fruit of the earth will be the pride and the beauty of the survivors of Israel. '
    3: '³ And it will come about that the one who is left in Zion and remains behind
      in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and purged
      the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the
      spirit of burning, '
    5: '⁵ then the Lord will create over the entire area of Mount Zion and over her
      assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by
      night; for over all the glory will be a canopy. '
    6: ⁶ And there will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge
      and protection from the storm and the rain.
  5:
    1: "¹ Let me sing now for my beloved\nA song of my beloved about His vineyard.\n\
      My beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.\n"
    2: "² He dug it all around, cleared it of stones,\nAnd planted it with the choicest\
      \ vine.\nAnd He built a tower in the middle of it,\nAnd also carved out a wine\
      \ vat in it;\nThen He expected it to produce good grapes,\nBut it produced only\
      \ worthless ones. \n"
    3: "³ “And now, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah,\nJudge between\
      \ Me and My vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it?\n\
      Why, when I expected it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones?\n"
    5: "⁵ So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard:\nI will remove\
      \ its hedge and it will be consumed;\nI will break down its wall and it will\
      \ become trampled ground.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will lay it waste;\nIt will not be pruned nor hoed,\nBut briars and thorns\
      \ will come up.\nI will also command the clouds not to rain on it.” \n"
    7: "⁷ For the vineyard of the Lord of armies is the house of Israel,\nAnd the\
      \ people of Judah are His delightful plant.\nSo He waited for justice, but behold,\
      \ there was bloodshed;\nFor righteousness, but behold, a cry for help. \n"
    8: "⁸ Woe to those who attach house to house and join field to field,\nUntil there\
      \ is no more room,\nAnd you alone are a landowner in the midst of the land!\n"
    9: "⁹ In my ears the Lord of armies has sworn, “Many houses shall certainly become\
      \ desolate,\nEven great and fine ones, without occupants.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For ten acres of vineyard will yield only one bath of wine,\nAnd a homer\
      \ of seed will yield only an ephah of grain.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to those who rise early in the morning so that they may pursue intoxicating\
      \ drink,\nWho stay up late in the evening so that wine may inflame them!\n"
    12: "¹² Their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp, by tambourine and flute,\
      \ and by wine;\nBut they do not pay attention to the deeds of the Lord,\nNor\
      \ do they consider the work of His hands. \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge;\nAnd their\
      \ nobles are famished,\nAnd their multitude is parched with thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth beyond measure;\n\
      And Jerusalem’s splendor, her multitude, her noise of revelry, and the jubilant\
      \ within her, descend into it.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So the common people will be humbled and the person of importance brought\
      \ low,\nThe eyes of the haughty also will be brought low.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But the Lord of armies will be exalted in judgment,\nAnd the holy God\
      \ will show Himself holy in righteousness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,\nAnd strangers will eat\
      \ in the ruins of the wealthy. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to those who drag wrongdoing with the cords of deceit,\nAnd sin as\
      \ if with cart ropes;\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Who say, “Let Him hurry, let Him do His work quickly, so that we may see\
      \ it;\nAnd let the plan of the Holy One of Israel approach\nAnd come to pass,\
      \ so that we may know it!”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;\nWho substitute darkness\
      \ for light and light for darkness;\nWho substitute bitter for sweet and sweet\
      \ for bitter!\n"
    21: "²¹ Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes\nAnd clever in their own sight!\n"
    22: "²² Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine,\nAnd valiant men in mixing\
      \ intoxicating drink,\n"
    23: "²³ Who declare the wicked innocent for a bribe,\nAnd take away the rights\
      \ of the ones who are in the right! \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble,\nAnd dry grass collapses\
      \ in the flame,\nSo their root will become like rot, and their blossom blow\
      \ away like dust;\nFor they have rejected the Law of the Lord of armies,\nAnd\
      \ discarded the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ For this reason the anger of the Lord has burned against His people,\n\
      And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them.\nAnd the mountains\
      \ quaked, and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets.\n\
      Despite all this, His anger is not spent,\nBut His hand is still stretched out.\
      \ \n"
    26: "²⁶ He will also lift up a flag to the distant nation,\nAnd whistle for it\
      \ from the ends of the earth;\nAnd behold, it will come with speed swiftly.\n"
    27: "²⁷ No one in it is tired or stumbles,\nNo one slumbers or sleeps;\nNor is\
      \ the undergarment at his waist loosened,\nNor his sandal strap broken.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent;\nThe hoofs of its horses\
      \ seem like flint, and its chariot wheels like a storm wind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions;\nIt growls\
      \ as it seizes the prey\nAnd carries it off with no one to save it.\n"
    30: "³⁰ And it will roar against it on that day like the roaring of the sea.\n\
      If one looks across to the land, behold, there is darkness and distress;\nEven\
      \ the light is darkened by its clouds."
  6:
    1: '¹ In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty
      and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. '
    2: '² Seraphim were standing above Him, each having six wings: with two each covered
      his face, and with two each covered his feet, and with two each flew. '
    3: "³ And one called out to another and said,\n“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord\
      \ of armies.\nThe whole earth is full of His glory.” \n"
    4: '⁴ And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called
      out, while the temple was filling with smoke. '
    5: "⁵ Then I said,\n“Woe to me, for I am ruined!\nBecause I am a man of unclean\
      \ lips,\nAnd I live among a people of unclean lips;\nFor my eyes have seen the\
      \ King, the Lord of armies.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which
      he had taken from the altar with tongs. '
    7: "⁷ He touched my mouth with it and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips;\
      \ and your guilt is taken away and atonement is made for your sin.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who
      will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!” '
    9: "⁹ And He said, “Go, and tell this people:\n‘Keep on listening, but do not\
      \ understand;\nAnd keep on looking, but do not gain knowledge.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Make the hearts of this people insensitive,\nTheir ears dull,\nAnd their\
      \ eyes blind,\nSo that they will not see with their eyes,\nHear with their ears,\n\
      Understand with their hearts,\nAnd return and be healed.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “Lord, how long?” And He answered,\n“Until cities are devastated\
      \ and without inhabitant,\nHouses are without people\nAnd the land is utterly\
      \ desolate,\n"
    12: "¹² The Lord has completely removed people,\nAnd there are many forsaken places\
      \ in the midst of the land.\n"
    13: "¹³ Yet there will still be a tenth portion in it,\nAnd it will again be subject\
      \ to burning,\nLike a terebinth or an oak\nWhose stump remains when it is cut\
      \ down.\nThe holy seed is its stump.”"
  7:
    1: '¹ Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah,
      king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king
      of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not conquer
      it. '
    2: "² When it was reported to the house of David, saying, “The Arameans have taken\
      \ a stand by Ephraim,” his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees\
      \ of the forest shake from the wind. \n"
    3: '³ Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son
      Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the
      fuller’s field, '
    4: '⁴ and say to him, ‘Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted
      because of these two stumps of smoldering logs, on account of the fierce anger
      of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Because Aram, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against
      you, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Let’s go up against Judah and terrorize it, and take it for ourselves by
      assault and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” '
    7: '⁷ this is what the Lord God says: “It shall not stand nor shall it come to
      pass. '
    8: '⁸ For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now
      within another sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces, so that it
      is no longer a people), '
    9: "⁹ and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of\
      \ Remaliah. If you will not believe, you certainly shall not last.”’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, '
    11: '¹¹ “Ask for a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; make it deep as Sheol
      or high as heaven.” '
    12: '¹² But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I put the Lord to the test!” '
    13: '¹³ Then he said, “Listen now, house of David! Is it too trivial a thing for
      you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as
      well? '
    14: '¹⁴ Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will
      conceive and give birth to a son, and she will name Him Immanuel. '
    15: '¹⁵ He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows enough to refuse evil
      and choose good. '
    16: "¹⁶ For before the boy knows enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land\
      \ whose two kings you dread will be abandoned. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house\
      \ such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah—the\
      \ days of the king of Assyria.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ On that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest
      part of the canals of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. '
    19: "¹⁹ They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the\
      \ cliffs, on all the thorn bushes, and on all the watering places. \n"
    20: "²⁰ On that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond\
      \ the Euphrates River (that is, with the king of Assyria), the head and the\
      \ hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard. \n"
    21: '²¹ Now on that day a person may keep alive only a heifer and a pair of sheep; '
    22: "²² and because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for\
      \ everyone who is left within the land will eat curds and honey. \n"
    23: '²³ And it will come about on that day, that every place where there used
      to be a thousand vines, valued at a thousand shekels of silver, will become
      briars and thorns. '
    24: '²⁴ People will come there with bows and arrows, because all the land will
      be briars and thorns. '
    25: ²⁵ As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the plow, you will
      not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for
      pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample.
  8:
    1: '¹ Then the Lord said to me, “Take for yourself a large tablet and write on
      it in ordinary letters: Maher-shalal-hash-baz. '
    2: '² And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony, Uriah the priest
      and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” '
    3: '³ So I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son.
      Then the Lord said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz; '
    4: "⁴ for before the boy knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the\
      \ wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried away before the\
      \ king of Assyria.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Again the Lord spoke to me further, saying, \n"
    6: "⁶ “Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah\n\
      And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah;\n"
    7: "⁷ Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and\

      \ banks.\n"
    8: "⁸ Then it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass through,\nIt\
      \ will reach as far as the neck;\nAnd the spread of its wings will fill the\
      \ expanse of your land, Immanuel. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered;\nAnd listen, all remote places\

    10: "¹⁰ Devise a plan, but it will fail;\nState a proposal, but it will not stand,\n\
      For God is with us.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ For so the Lord spoke to me with mighty power and instructed me not to\

    12: "¹² “You are not to say, ‘It is a conspiracy!’\nRegarding everything that\
      \ this people call a conspiracy,\nAnd you are not to fear what they fear or\

    13: "¹³ It is the Lord of armies whom you are to regard as holy.\nAnd He shall\
      \ be your fear,\nAnd He shall be your dread.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then He will become a sanctuary;\nBut to both houses of Israel, He will\

      \ the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Many will stumble over them,\nThen they will fall and be broken;\nThey\

    16: '¹⁶ Bind up the testimony, seal the Law among my disciples. '
    17: '¹⁷ And I will wait for the Lord who is hiding His face from the house of
      Jacob; I will wait eagerly for Him. '
    18: "¹⁸ Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are for signs and\

    19: '¹⁹ When they say to you, “Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper

      dead in behalf of the living? '
    20: '²⁰ To the Law and to the testimony! If they do not speak in accordance with

    22: ²² Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the
      gloom of anguish; and they will be driven away into darkness.
  9:
    1: "¹ But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In earlier times\
      \ He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but\

    2: "² The people who walk in darkness\nWill see a great light;\nThose who live\
      \ in a dark land,\nThe light will shine on them.\n"
    3: "³ You will multiply the nation,\nYou will increase their joy;\nThey will rejoice\

    4: "⁴ For You will break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders,\n\

    5: "⁵ For every boot of the marching warrior in the roar of battle,\nAnd cloak\

    8: "⁸ The Lord sends a message against Jacob,\nAnd it falls on Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ And all the people know it,\nThat is, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria,\n\

    13: "¹³ Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them,\nNor do they seek\

    14: "¹⁴ So the Lord cuts off head and tail from Israel,\nBoth palm branch and\

    17: "¹⁷ Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men,\nNor does He\

    18: "¹⁸ For wickedness burns like a fire;\nIt consumes briars and thorns;\nIt\

    19: "¹⁹ By the wrath of the Lord of armies the land is burned,\nAnd the people\

    20: "²⁰ They devour what is on the right hand but are still hungry,\nAnd they\

    21: "²¹ Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,\nAnd together they are\

  10:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who enact unjust statutes\nAnd to those who constantly record\

    3: "³ Now what will you do in the day of punishment,\nAnd in the devastation which\
      \ will come from afar?\nTo whom will you flee for help?\nAnd where will you\
      \ leave your wealth?\n"
    4: "⁴ Nothing remains but to crouch among the captives\nOr fall among those killed.\n\
      In spite of all this, His anger does not turn away\nAnd His hand is still stretched\

    5: "⁵ Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger\nAnd the staff in whose hands is My\

    6: "⁶ I send it against a godless nation\nAnd commission it against the people\
      \ of My fury\nTo capture spoils and to seize plunder,\nAnd to trample them down\
      \ like mud in the streets.\n"
    7: "⁷ Yet it does not so intend,\nNor does it plan so in its heart,\nBut rather\
      \ it is its purpose to destroy\nAnd to eliminate many nations.\n"
    8: "⁸ For it says, “Are not my officers all kings?\n"
    9: "⁹ Is not Calno like Carchemish,\nOr Hamath like Arpad,\nOr Samaria like Damascus?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols,\nWhose carved images\
      \ were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,\n"
    11: "¹¹ Shall I not do the same to Jerusalem and her images\nJust as I have done\
      \ to Samaria and her idols?” \n"
    12: '¹² So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion
      and on Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart
      of the king of Assyria and the arrogant pride of his eyes.” '
    13: "¹³ For he has said,\n“By the power of my hand and by my wisdom I did this,\n\
      Because I have understanding;\nAnd I removed the boundaries of the peoples\n\
      And plundered their treasures,\nAnd like a powerful man I brought down their\
      \ inhabitants,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And my hand reached to the riches of the peoples like a nest,\nAnd as\
      \ one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth;\nAnd there was not one\
      \ that flapped its wing, opened its beak, or chirped.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it?\nIs the saw\
      \ to exalt itself over the one who wields it?\nThat would be like a club wielding\
      \ those who lift it,\nOr like a rod lifting the one who is not wood.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore the Lord, the God of armies, will send a wasting disease among\
      \ his stout warriors;\nAnd under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning\
      \ flame.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ And the Light of Israel will become a fire and Israel’s Holy One a flame,\n\
      And it will burn and devour his thorns and his briars in a single day.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ And He will destroy the glory of his forest and of his fruitful garden,\
      \ both soul and body,\nAnd it will be as when a sick person wastes away.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ And the rest of the trees of his forest will be so small in number\nThat\

    20: "²⁰ Now on that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob\
      \ who have escaped, will no longer rely on the one who struck them, but will\
      \ truly rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. \n"
    21: "²¹ A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.\n"
    22: "²² For though your people, Israel, may be like the sand of the sea,\nOnly\
      \ a remnant within them will return;\nA destruction is determined, overflowing\
      \ with righteousness. \n"
    23: "²³ For a complete destruction, one that is determined, the Lord God of armies\
      \ will execute in the midst of the whole land. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Therefore this is what the Lord God of armies says: “My people, you who
      dwell in Zion, do not fear the Assyrian who strikes you with the rod, and lifts
      up his staff against you the way Egypt did. '
    25: '²⁵ For in a very little while My indignation against you will be ended and
      My anger will be directed toward their destruction.” '
    26: '²⁶ The Lord of armies will wield a whip against him like the defeat of Midian
      at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it
      up the way He did in Egypt. '
    27: "²⁷ So it will be on that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulders,\
      \ and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of fatness.\
      \ \n"
    28: "²⁸ He has come against Aiath,\nHe has passed through Migron;\nAt Michmash\

    34: "³⁴ He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron axe,\nAnd Lebanon\

    2: "² The Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him,\nThe spirit of wisdom and understanding,\n\
      The spirit of counsel and strength,\nThe spirit of knowledge and the fear of\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ And He will delight in the fear of the Lord,\nAnd He will not judge by what\
      \ His eyes see,\nNor make decisions by what His ears hear;\n"
    4: "⁴ But with righteousness He will judge the poor,\nAnd decide with fairness\
      \ for the humble of the earth;\nAnd He will strike the earth with the rod of\
      \ His mouth,\nAnd with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.\n"
    5: "⁵ Also righteousness will be the belt around His hips,\nAnd faithfulness the\
      \ belt around His waist. \n"
    6: "⁶ And the wolf will dwell with the lamb,\nAnd the leopard will lie down with\
      \ the young goat,\nAnd the calf and the young lion and the fattened steer will\

    12: "¹² And He will lift up a flag for the nations\nAnd assemble the banished\
      \ ones of Israel,\nAnd will gather the dispersed of Judah\nFrom the four corners\
      \ of the earth.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart,\nAnd those who harass Judah\
      \ will be eliminated;\nEphraim will not be jealous of Judah,\nAnd Judah will\
      \ not harass Ephraim.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west;\nTogether\

    4: "⁴ Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out,\nTheir voice is heard all the way to Jahaz;\n\

    5: "⁵ My heart cries out for Moab;\nHis fugitives are as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah,\n\

    6: "⁶ For the waters of Nimrim are desolate.\nIndeed, the grass is withered, the\

    13: '¹³ This is the word which the Lord spoke earlier concerning Moab. '

    4: "⁴ Now on that day the glory of Jacob will fade,\nAnd the fatness of his flesh\

    5: "⁵ It will be like the reaper gathering the standing grain,\nAs his arm harvests\
      \ the ears,\nOr it will be like one gleaning ears of grain\nIn the Valley of\

    6: "⁶ Yet gleanings will be left in it like the shaking of an olive tree,\nTwo\
      \ or three olives on the topmost branch,\nFour or five on the branches of a\

    7: "⁷ On that day man will look to his Maker\nAnd his eyes will look to the Holy\

    8: "⁸ And he will not look to the altars, the work of his hands,\nNor will he\
      \ look to that which his fingers have made,\nEven the Asherim and incense altars.\n"
    9: "⁹ On that day their strong cities will be like abandoned places in the forest,\n\
      Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel;\nAnd the land\
      \ will be a desolation.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For you have forgotten the God of your salvation\nAnd have not remembered\
      \ the rock of your refuge.\nTherefore you plant delightful plants\nAnd set them\
      \ with vine shoots of a strange god.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On the day that you plant it you carefully fence it in,\nAnd in the morning\
      \ you bring your seed to blossom;\nBut the harvest will flee\nOn a day of illness\

    12: "¹² Oh, the uproar of many peoples\nWho roar like the roaring of the seas,\n\
      And the rumbling of nations\nWho rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters!\n"
    13: "¹³ The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters,\nBut He will rebuke\
      \ them, and they will flee far away,\nAnd be chased like chaff on the mountains\
      \ before the wind,\nOr like whirling dust before a gale.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ At evening time, behold, there is terror!\nBefore morning they are gone.\n\
      This will be the fate of those who plunder us\nAnd the lot of those who pillage\
      \ us."
  18:
    1: "¹ Woe, land of whirring wings\nWhich lies beyond the rivers of Cush,\n"
    2: "² Which sends messengers by the sea,\nEven in papyrus vessels on the surface\

    4: "⁴ For this is what the Lord has told me:\n“I will quietly look from My dwelling\
      \ place\nLike dazzling heat in the sunshine,\nLike a cloud of dew in the heat\
      \ of harvest.”\n"
    5: "⁵ For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms\nAnd the flower becomes\
      \ a ripening grape,\nHe will cut off the shoots with pruning knives,\nAnd remove\
      \ and tear away the spreading branches.\n"
    6: "⁶ They will be left together for mountain birds of prey,\nAnd for the animals\
      \ of the earth;\nAnd the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them,\n\
      And all the animals of the earth will spend harvest time on them.\n"
    7: "⁷ At that time a gift of tribute will be brought to the Lord of armies\nFrom\

  19:
    1: "¹ The pronouncement concerning Egypt:\nBehold, the Lord is riding on a swift\

    21: '²¹ So the Lord will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know

      and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your sandals off your feet.”
      And he did so, going naked and barefoot. '
    3: '³ Then the Lord said, “Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot

    5: '⁵ Then they will be terrified and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt

  21:

    20: "²⁰ Then it will come about on that day,\nThat I will summon My servant Eliakim\
      \ the son of Hilkiah,\n"
    21: "²¹ And I will clothe him with your tunic\nAnd tie your sash securely around\
      \ him.\nI will hand your authority over to him,\nAnd he will become a father\
      \ to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.\n"
    22: "²² Then I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder;\nWhen he\
      \ opens, no one will shut,\nWhen he shuts, no one will open.\n"
    23: "²³ I will drive him like a peg in a firm place,\nAnd he will become a throne\
      \ of glory to his father’s house. \n"
    24: '²⁴ So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring
      and the descendants, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars. '
    25: ²⁵ On that day,” declares the Lord of armies, “the peg driven into a firm
      place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load that is hanging
      on it will be cut off, for the Lord has spoken.”
  23:
    1: "¹ The pronouncement concerning Tyre:\nWail, you ships of Tarshish,\nFor Tyre\
      \ is destroyed, without house or harbor;\nIt is reported to them from the land\
      \ of Cyprus.\n"
    2: "² Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland,\nYou merchants of Sidon;\n\
      Your messengers crossed the sea\n"
    3: "³ And were on many waters.\nThe grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River\
      \ was her revenue;\nAnd she was the market of nations.\n"
    4: "⁴ Be ashamed, Sidon,\nFor the sea speaks, the stronghold of the sea, saying,\n\
      “I have neither been in labor nor given birth,\nI have neither brought up young\
      \ men nor raised virgins.”\n"
    5: "⁵ When the report reaches Egypt,\nThey will be in anguish over the report\
      \ of Tyre.\n"
    6: "⁶ Pass over to Tarshish;\nWail, you inhabitants of the coastland.\n"
    7: "⁷ Is this your jubilant city,\nWhose origin is from antiquity,\nWhose feet\
      \ used to bring her to colonize distant places? \n"
    8: "⁸ Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,\nWhose merchants\
      \ were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?\n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord of armies has planned it, to defile the pride of all beauty,\n\
      To despise all the honored of the earth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Overflow your land like the Nile, you daughter of Tarshish,\nThere is\
      \ no more restraint.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He has stretched His hand out over the sea,\nHe has made the kingdoms\
      \ tremble;\nThe Lord has given a command concerning Canaan to demolish its strongholds.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² He has said, “You shall not be jubilant anymore, you crushed virgin daughter\
      \ of Sidon.\nArise, pass over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Behold, the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people that did not exist;\
      \ Assyria allocated it for desert creatures—they erected their siege towers,\
      \ they stripped its palaces, they made it a ruin. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wail, you ships of Tarshish,\nFor your stronghold is destroyed. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Now on that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days\
      \ of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the\
      \ song of the prostitute: \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Take your harp, wander around the city,\nYou forgotten prostitute;\nPluck\
      \ the strings skillfully, sing many songs,\nThat you may be remembered. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ It will come about at the end of seventy years that the Lord will visit
      Tyre. Then she will go back to her prostitute’s wages and commit prostitution
      with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. '
    18: ¹⁸ Her profit and her prostitute’s wages will be sacred to the Lord; it will
      not be stored up or hoarded, but her profit will become sufficient food and
      magnificent attire for those who dwell in the presence of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ Behold, the Lord lays the earth waste, devastates it, twists its surface,
      and scatters its inhabitants. '
    2: '² And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his master, the
      female servant like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like
      the borrower, the creditor like the debtor. '
    3: '³ The earth will be completely laid waste and completely plundered, for the
      Lord has spoken this word. '
    4: '⁴ The earth dries up and crumbles away, the mainland dries out and crumbles
      away, the exalted of the people of the earth dwindle. '
    5: '⁵ The earth is also defiled by its inhabitants, for they violated laws, altered
      statutes, and broke the everlasting covenant. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live on it suffer for\
      \ their guilt. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth decrease in number, and\
      \ few people are left. \n"
    7: "⁷ The new wine mourns,\nThe vine decays,\nAll the joyful-hearted sigh.\n"
    8: "⁸ The joy of tambourines ceases,\nThe noise of revelers stops,\nThe joy of\
      \ the harp ceases.\n"
    9: "⁹ They do not drink wine with song;\nIntoxicating drink is bitter to those\
      \ who drink it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The city of chaos is broken down;\nEvery house is shut up so that no one\
      \ may enter.\n"
    11: "¹¹ There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine;\nAll joy turns\
      \ to gloom.\nThe joy of the earth is banished.\n"
    12: "¹² Desolation is left in the city\nAnd the gate is battered to ruins.\n"
    13: "¹³ For so it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples,\nAs the\

    16: "¹⁶ From the ends of the earth we hear songs: “Glory to the Righteous One,”\n\
      But I say, “I am finished! I am finished! Woe to me!\nThe treacherous deal treacherously,\n\
      And the treacherous deal very treacherously.”\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Terror and pit and snare\nConfront you, you inhabitant of the earth.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then it will be that the one who flees the sound of terror will fall into\
      \ the pit,\nAnd the one who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare;\n\
      For the windows above are opened, and the foundations of the earth shake.\n"

    23: "²³ Then the moon will be ashamed and the sun be put to shame,\nFor the Lord\
      \ of armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,\nAnd His glory will be\
      \ before His elders."
  25:
    1: "¹ Lord, You are my God;\nI will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name;\n\
      For You have worked wonders,\nPlans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.\n"
    2: "² For You have turned a city into a heap,\nA fortified city into a ruin;\n\
      A palace of strangers is no longer a city,\nIt will never be rebuilt.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore a strong people will glorify You;\nCities of ruthless nations\

      \ breath of the ruthless\nIs like a rain storm against a wall.\n"
    5: "⁵ Like heat in a dry land, You subdue the uproar of foreigners;\nLike heat\
      \ by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced. \n"
    6: "⁶ Now the Lord of armies will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on\
      \ this mountain;\nA banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow,\nAnd refined,\
      \ aged wine.\n"
    7: "⁷ And on this mountain He will destroy the covering which is over all peoples,\n\
      The veil which is stretched over all nations.\n"
    8: "⁸ He will swallow up death for all time,\nAnd the Lord God will wipe tears\

    11: "¹¹ And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it\nAs a swimmer spreads\

  26:
    1: "¹ On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:\n“We have a strong\

    9: "⁹ At night my soul longs for You,\nIndeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently;\n\
      For when the earth experiences Your judgments,\nThe inhabitants of the world\

    10: "¹⁰ Though the wicked person is shown compassion,\nHe does not learn righteousness;\n\

    6: "⁶ A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment,\nA strength to those who\
      \ repel the onslaught at the gate.\n"
    7: "⁷ And these also reel with wine and stagger from intoxicating drink:\nThe\

    13: "¹³ So the word of the Lord to them will be,\n“Order on order, order on order,\n\

    20: "²⁰ The bed is too short on which to stretch out,\nAnd the blanket is too\

    28: "²⁸ Grain for bread is crushed,\nIndeed, he does not continue to thresh it\

    17: "¹⁷ Is it not yet just a little while\nBefore Lebanon will be turned into\

    18: "¹⁸ On that day those who are deaf will hear words of a book,\nAnd out of\

      \ pale now;\n"
    23: "²³ But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst,\nThey\

    2: "² Who proceed down to Egypt\nWithout consulting Me,\nTo take refuge in the\
      \ safety of Pharaoh,\nAnd to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame,\nAnd the shelter in\

    4: "⁴ For their officials are at Zoan\nAnd their ambassadors arrive at Hanes.\n"
    5: "⁵ Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who do not benefit them,\n\
      Who are not a help or benefit, but a source of shame and also disgrace.” \n"
    6: "⁶ The pronouncement concerning the animals of the Negev:\nThrough a land of\

    12: "¹² Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says:\n“Since you have rejected\
      \ this word\nAnd have put your trust in oppression and crookedness, and have\
      \ relied on them,\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore this wrongdoing will be to you\nLike a breach about to fall,\n\
      A bulge in a high wall,\nWhose collapse comes suddenly in an instant,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter’s jar,\nSo ruthlessly\
      \ shattered\nThat a shard will not be found among its pieces\nTo take fire from\
      \ a hearth\nOr to scoop water from a cistern.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ For this is what the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has said:\n“In\
      \ repentance and rest you will be saved,\nIn quietness and trust is your strength.”\n\
      But you were not willing,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And you said, “No, for we will flee on horses!”\nTherefore you shall flee!\n\
      “And we will ride on swift horses!”\nTherefore those who pursue you shall be\
      \ swift.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ One thousand will flee at the threat of one man;\nYou will flee at the\
      \ threat of five,\nUntil you are left like a signal post on a mountain top,\n\
      And like a flag on a hill. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore the Lord longs to be gracious to you,\nAnd therefore He waits\
      \ on high to have compassion on you.\nFor the Lord is a God of justice;\nHow\
      \ blessed are all those who long for Him. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ For, you people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer.
      He will certainly be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears
      it, He will answer you. '
    20: '²⁰ Although the Lord has given you bread of deprivation and water of oppression,
      He, your Teacher, will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will see your Teacher. '
    21: '²¹ Your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk

    22: "²² And you will desecrate your carved images plated with silver, and your\
      \ cast metal images plated with gold. You will scatter them as a filthy thing,\

    23: '²³ Then He will give you rain for your seed which you will sow in the ground,
      and bread from the yield of the ground, and it will be rich and plentiful; on
      that day your livestock will graze in a wide pasture. '
    24: '²⁴ Also the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned feed,
      which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. '
    25: '²⁵ And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be streams
      running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. '
    26: "²⁶ And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and\

    27: "²⁷ Behold, the name of the Lord comes from a remote place;\nHis anger is\
      \ burning and dense with smoke;\nHis lips are filled with indignation,\nAnd\
      \ His tongue is like a consuming fire;\n"
    28: "²⁸ His breath is like an overflowing river,\nWhich reaches to the neck,\n\
      To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve,\nAnd to put in the jaws of the\
      \ peoples the bridle which leads astray.\n"
    29: "²⁹ You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival,\nAnd gladness\
      \ of heart as when one marches to the sound of the flute,\nTo go to the mountain\
      \ of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.\n"
    30: "³⁰ And the Lord will cause His voice of authority to be heard,\nAnd the descending\
      \ of His arm to be seen in fierce anger,\nAnd in the flame of a consuming fire\n\

    31: "³¹ For at the voice of the Lord Assyria will be terrified,\nWhen He strikes\
      \ with the rod.\n"
    32: "³² And every blow of the rod of punishment,\nWhich the Lord will lay on him,\n\

    33: "³³ For Topheth has long been ready,\nIndeed, it has been prepared for the\
      \ king.\nHe has made it deep and large,\nA pyre of fire with plenty of wood;\n\
      The breath of the Lord, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire."
  31:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help\nAnd rely on horses,\nAnd trust\

      But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the Lord!\n"
    2: "² Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster,\nAnd does not retract His words,\n\
      But will arise against the house of evildoers,\nAnd against the help of the\
      \ workers of injustice.\n"
    3: "³ Now the Egyptians are human and not God,\nAnd their horses are flesh and\

    5: "⁵ Like flying birds so the Lord of armies will protect Jerusalem.\nHe will\

    6: '⁶ Return to Him against whom you have been profoundly obstinate, you sons

    7: "⁷ For on that day every person will reject his silver idols and his gold idols,\

    8: "⁸ And the Assyrian will fall by a sword not wielded by a man,\nAnd a sword\
      \ not of man will devour him.\nSo he will not escape the sword,\nAnd his young\

    9: "⁹ “His rock will pass away because of panic,\nAnd his officers will be terrified\

      \ is in Jerusalem."
  32:
    1: "¹ Behold, a king will reign righteously,\nAnd officials will rule justly.\n"
    2: "² Each will be like a refuge from the wind\nAnd a shelter from the storm,\n\

    3: "³ Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded,\nAnd the ears of those\

    4: "⁴ The mind of the rash will discern the truth,\nAnd the tongue of the stammerers\

    5: "⁵ No longer will the fool be called noble,\nOr the rogue be spoken of as generous.\n"
    6: "⁶ For a fool speaks nonsense,\nAnd his heart inclines toward wickedness:\n\
      To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the Lord,\nTo keep the hungry\
      \ person unsatisfied\nAnd to withhold drink from the thirsty.\n"
    7: "⁷ As for a rogue, his weapons are evil;\nHe devises wicked schemes\nTo destroy\

    11: "¹¹ Tremble, you women who are at ease;\nBe troubled, you complacent daughters;\n\

    5: "⁵ Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened,\nAnd the ears of those\
      \ who are deaf will be unstopped.\n"
    6: "⁶ Then those who limp will leap like a deer,\nAnd the tongue of those who\

      And streams in the desert.\n"
    7: "⁷ The scorched land will become a pool\nAnd the thirsty ground springs of\

    1: '¹ Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria

    6: '⁶ Behold, you have relied on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, on which

    8: '⁸ Now then, come make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give
      you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to put riders on them! '
    9: '⁹ How then can you drive back even one official of the least of my master’s

    12: "¹² But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to\
      \ you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to\
      \ eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?” \n"
    13: '¹³ Then Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Judean and said,
      “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! '
    14: '¹⁴ This is what the king says: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will
      not be able to save you; '
    15: '¹⁵ and do not let Hezekiah lead you to rely on the Lord, saying, “The Lord
      will certainly save us. This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria!” '
    16: '¹⁶ Do not listen to Hezekiah,’ for this is what the king of Assyria says:
      ‘Surrender to me and come out to me, and eat, each one, of his vine and each
      of his fig tree, and each drink of the waters of his own cistern, '
    17: '¹⁷ until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
      grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. '
    18: '¹⁸ Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you, saying, “The Lord will save
      us.” Has any one of the gods of the nations saved his land from the hand of
      the king of Assyria? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?
      And when have they saved Samaria from my hand? '
    20: "²⁰ Who among all the gods of these lands have saved their land from my hand,\
      \ that the Lord would save Jerusalem from my hand?’” \n"
    21: '²¹ But they were silent and did not answer him so much as a word; for the
      king’s command was, “Do not answer him.” '
    22: ²² Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna
      the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the secretary, came to Hezekiah with
      their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
  37:
    1: '¹ Now when King Hezekiah heard the report, he tore his clothes, covered himself
      with sackcloth, and entered the house of the Lord. '
    2: '² Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the household, with Shebna the
      scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the
      prophet, the son of Amoz. '
    3: '³ And they said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This day is a day of
      distress, rebuke, and humiliation; for children have come to the point of birth,
      and there is no strength to deliver them. '
    4: "⁴ Perhaps the Lord your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master\
      \ the king of Assyria has sent to taunt the living God, and will avenge the\
      \ words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the\
      \ remnant that is left.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. '
    6: '⁶ And Isaiah said to them, “This is what you shall say to your master: ‘This
      is what the Lord says: “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have
      heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. '
    7: "⁷ Behold, I am going to put a spirit in him so that he will hear news and\
      \ return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.”’”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah,
      for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. '
    9: '⁹ Now he heard them say regarding Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has come out
      to fight against you,” and when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah,
      saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “This is what you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your
      God in whom you trust deceive you by saying, “Jerusalem will not be handed over
      to the king of Assyria.” '
    11: '¹¹ Behold, you yourself have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
      all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be saved? '
    12: '¹² Did the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed save them: Gozan,
      Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar? '
    13: "¹³ Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of\
      \ Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read
      it, and he went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Lord of armies, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You
      are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and
      earth. '
    17: '¹⁷ Incline Your ear, Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, Lord, and see; and listen
      to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to taunt the living God. '
    18: '¹⁸ Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries and
      their lands, '
    19: '¹⁹ and have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but only
      the work of human hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. '
    20: "²⁰ But now Lord, our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms\
      \ of the earth may know that You alone, Lord, are God.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, “This is what
      the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib
      king of Assyria, '
    22: "²² this is the word that the Lord has spoken against him:\n“She has shown\
      \ contempt for you and derided you,\nThe virgin daughter of Zion;\nThe daughter\
      \ of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you!\n"
    23: "²³ Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?\nAnd against whom have you raised\
      \ your voice\nAnd haughtily raised your eyes?\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel!\n"
    24: "²⁴ Through your servants you have taunted the Lord,\nAnd you have said, ‘With\
      \ my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains,\nTo the remotest\
      \ parts of Lebanon;\nAnd I cut down its tall cedars and its choice junipers.\n\
      And I will come to its highest peak, its thickest forest.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I dug wells and drank waters,\nAnd with the sole of my feet I dried up\n\
      All the canals of Egypt.’\n"
    26: "²⁶ Have you not heard?\nLong ago I did it,\nFrom ancient times I planned\
      \ it.\nNow I have brought it about\nThat you would turn fortified cities into\
      \ ruined heaps.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Therefore their inhabitants were powerless,\nThey were shattered and put\
      \ to shame;\nThey were like the vegetation of the field and the green grass,\n\
      Like grass on the housetops that is scorched before it has grown.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But I know your sitting down,\nYour going out, your coming in,\nAnd your\
      \ raging against Me.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Because of your raging against Me\nAnd because your complacency has come\
      \ up to My ears,\nI will put My hook in your nose\nAnd My bridle in your lips,\n\
      And I will turn you back by the way that you came. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows
      of itself, in the second year what grows from the same, and in the third year
      sow, harvest, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. '
    31: '³¹ The survivors that are left of the house of Judah will again take root
      downward and bear fruit upward. '
    32: "³² For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go, and out of Mount Zion survivors.\
      \ The zeal of the Lord of armies will perform this.”’ \n"
    33: '³³ “Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria: ‘He
      will not come to this city nor shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before
      it with a shield, nor heap up an assault ramp against it. '
    34: '³⁴ By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come
      to this city,’ declares the Lord. '
    35: "³⁵ ‘For I will protect this city to save it for My own sake, and for My servant\
      \ David’s sake.’” \n"
    36: '³⁶ Then the angel of the Lord went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of
      the Assyrians; and when the rest got up early in the morning, behold, all of
      the 185,000 were dead. '
    37: '³⁷ So Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived
      in Nineveh. '
    38: ³⁸ Then it came about, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god,
      that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and they escaped
      to the land of Ararat. And his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
  38:
    1: '¹ In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet, the
      son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Set
      your house in order, for you are going to die and not live.’” '
    2: '² Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, '
    3: "³ and said, “Please, Lord, just remember how I have walked before You wholeheartedly\
      \ and in truth, and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept\
      \ profusely. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your father
      David says: “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will
      add fifteen years to your life. '
    6: "⁶ And I will save you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria;\
      \ and I will protect this city.”’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “And this shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will perform
      this word that He has spoken: '
    8: "⁸ Behold, I will make the shadow on the stairway, which has gone down with\
      \ the sun on the stairway of Ahaz, go back ten steps.” So the sun’s shadow went\
      \ back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down. \n"
    9: "⁹ This is a writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I said, “In the middle of my life\nI am to enter the gates of Sheol;\n\
      I have been deprived of the rest of my years.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ I said, “I will not see the Lord,\nThe Lord in the land of the living;\n\
      I will no longer look on mankind among the inhabitants of the world.\n"
    12: "¹² Like a shepherd’s tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me;\n\
      As a weaver I rolled up my life.\nHe cuts me off from the loom;\nFrom day until\
      \ night You make an end of me.\n"
    13: "¹³ I composed my soul until morning.\nLike a lion—so He breaks all my bones,\n\
      From day until night You make an end of me.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Like a swallow, like a crane, so I twitter;\nI moan like a dove;\nMy eyes\
      \ look wistfully to the heights;\nLord, I am oppressed, be my security. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “What shall I say?\nFor He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it;\n\
      I will walk quietly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Lord, by these things people live,\nAnd in all these is the life of my\
      \ spirit;\nRestore me to health and let me live!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Behold, for my own welfare I had great bitterness;\nBut You have kept\
      \ my soul from the pit of nothingness,\nFor You have hurled all my sins behind\
      \ Your back.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For Sheol cannot thank You,\nDeath cannot praise You;\nThose who go down\
      \ to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ It is the living who give thanks to You, as I do today;\nA father tells\
      \ his sons about Your faithfulness.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The Lord is certain to save me;\nSo we will play my songs on stringed\
      \ instruments\nAll the days of our life at the house of the Lord.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Now Isaiah had said, “Have them take a cake of figs and apply it to the
      boil, so that he may recover.” '
    22: ²² Then Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the house
      of the Lord?”
  39:
    1: '¹ At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters
      and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. '
    2: '² Hezekiah was pleased, and let them see all his treasure house, the silver,
      the gold, the balsam oil, the excellent olive oil, his entire armory, and everything
      that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all
      his realm that Hezekiah did not let them see. '
    3: '³ Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did
      these men say, and from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They
      came to me from a far country, from Babylon.” '
    4: "⁴ Then he said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered,\
      \ “They have seen everything that is in my house; there is nothing among my\
      \ treasuries that I have not let them see.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Isaiah then said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of armies, '
    6: '⁶ ‘Behold, the days are coming when everything that is in your house, and
      what your fathers have stored up to this day, will be carried to Babylon; nothing
      will be left,’ says the Lord. '
    7: '⁷ ‘And some of your sons who will come from you, whom you will father, will
      be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” '
    8: ⁸ Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord which you have spoken
      is good.” For he thought, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”
  40:
    1: "¹ “Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.\n"
    2: "² “Speak kindly to Jerusalem;\nAnd call out to her, that her warfare has ended,\n\
      That her guilt has been removed,\nThat she has received of the Lord’s hand\n\
      Double for all her sins.” \n"
    3: "³ The voice of one calling out,\n“Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness;\n\
      Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\n"
    4: "⁴ Let every valley be lifted up,\nAnd every mountain and hill be made low;\n\
      And let the uneven ground become a plain,\nAnd the rugged terrain a broad valley;\n"
    5: "⁵ Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed,\nAnd all flesh will see it\
      \ together;\nFor the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”\n"
    6: "⁶ A voice says, “Call out.”\nThen he answered, “What shall I call out?”\n\
      All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.\n"
    7: "⁷ The grass withers, the flower fades,\nWhen the breath of the Lord blows\
      \ upon it;\nThe people are indeed grass!\n"
    8: "⁸ The grass withers, the flower fades,\nBut the word of our God stands forever.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Go up on a high mountain,\nZion, messenger of good news,\nRaise your voice\
      \ forcefully,\nJerusalem, messenger of good news;\nRaise it up, do not fear.\n\
      Say to the cities of Judah,\n“Here is your God!”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Behold, the Lord God will come with might,\nWith His arm ruling for Him.\n\
      Behold, His compensation is with Him,\nAnd His reward before Him.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Like a shepherd He will tend His flock,\nIn His arm He will gather the\
      \ lambs\nAnd carry them in the fold of His robe;\nHe will gently lead the nursing\
      \ ewes. \n"
    12: "¹² Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,\nAnd measured the\
      \ heavens with a span,\nAnd calculated the dust of the earth with a measure,\n\
      And weighed the mountains in a balance\nAnd the hills in a pair of scales?\n"
    13: "¹³ Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord,\nOr as His counselor has informed\
      \ Him?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With whom did He consult and who gave Him understanding?\nAnd who taught\
      \ Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge,\nAnd informed Him of\
      \ the way of understanding?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,\nAnd are regarded as\
      \ a speck of dust on the scales;\nBehold, He lifts up the islands like fine\
      \ dust.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Even Lebanon is not enough to burn,\nNor its animals enough for a burnt\
      \ offering.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ All the nations are as nothing before Him,\nThey are regarded by Him as\
      \ less than nothing and meaningless. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ To whom then will you liken God?\nOr what likeness will you compare with\
      \ Him?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ As for the idol, a craftsman casts it,\nA goldsmith plates it with gold,\n\
      And a silversmith fashions chains of silver.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He who is too impoverished for such an offering\nSelects a tree that does\
      \ not rot;\nHe seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman\nTo prepare an idol\
      \ that will not totter. \n"
    21: "²¹ Do you not know? Have you not heard?\nHas it not been declared to you\
      \ from the beginning?\nHave you not understood from the foundations of the earth?\n"
    22: "²² It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,\nAnd its inhabitants\
      \ are like grasshoppers,\nWho stretches out the heavens like a curtain\nAnd\
      \ spreads them out like a tent to live in.\n"
    23: "²³ It is He who reduces rulers to nothing,\nWho makes the judges of the earth\
      \ meaningless.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Scarcely have they been planted,\nScarcely have they been sown,\nScarcely\
      \ has their stock taken root in the earth,\nBut He merely blows on them, and\
      \ they wither,\nAnd the storm carries them away like stubble.\n"
    25: "²⁵ “To whom then will you compare Me\nThat I would be his equal?” says the\
      \ Holy One.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Raise your eyes on high\nAnd see who has created these stars,\nThe One\
      \ who brings out their multitude by number,\nHe calls them all by name;\nBecause\
      \ of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power,\nNot one of them\
      \ is missing. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Why do you say, Jacob, and you assert, Israel,\n“My way is hidden from\
      \ the Lord,\nAnd the justice due me escapes the notice of my God”?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Do you not know? Have you not heard?\nThe Everlasting God, the Lord, the\
      \ Creator of the ends of the earth\nDoes not become weary or tired.\nHis understanding\
      \ is unsearchable.\n"
    29: "²⁹ He gives strength to the weary,\nAnd to the one who lacks might He increases\
      \ power.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Though youths grow weary and tired,\nAnd vigorous young men stumble badly,\n"
    31: "³¹ Yet those who wait for the Lord\nWill gain new strength;\nThey will mount\
      \ up with wings like eagles,\nThey will run and not get tired,\nThey will walk\
      \ and not become weary."
  41:
    1: "¹ “Listen to Me in silence, you coastlands,\nAnd let the peoples gain new\
      \ strength;\nLet them come forward, then let them speak;\nLet’s come together\
      \ for judgment.\n"
    2: "² Who has stirred one from the east\nWhom He calls in righteousness to His\
      \ feet?\nHe turns nations over to him\nAnd subdues kings.\nHe makes them like\
      \ dust with his sword,\nLike the wind-driven chaff with his bow.\n"
    3: "³ He pursues them, passing on in safety,\nBy a way he had not been traversing\
      \ with his feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ Who has performed and accomplished it,\nSummoning the generations from the\
      \ beginning?\n‘I, the Lord, am the first, and with the last. I am He.’” \n"
    5: "⁵ The coastlands have seen and are afraid;\nThe ends of the earth tremble;\n\
      They have approached and have come.\n"
    6: "⁶ Each one helps his neighbor\nAnd says to his brother, “Be strong!”\n"
    7: "⁷ So the craftsman encourages the smelter,\nAnd he who smooths metal with\
      \ the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil,\nSaying of the soldering, “It\

    8: "⁸ “But you, Israel, My servant,\nJacob whom I have chosen,\nDescendant of\

    9: "⁹ You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth\nAnd called from its remotest\

    10: "¹⁰ Do not fear, for I am with you;\nDo not be afraid, for I am your God.\n\

      \ righteous right hand.’\n"
    11: "¹¹ Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored;\n\

    12: "¹² You will seek those who quarrel with you, but will not find them,\nThose\

    15: "¹⁵ Behold, I turned you into a new, sharp threshing sledge with double edges;\n\
      You will thresh the mountains and pulverize them,\nAnd make the hills like chaff.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,\nAnd the storm\

    17: "¹⁷ “The poor and needy are seeking water, but there is none,\nAnd their tongues\

    18: "¹⁸ I will open rivers on the bare heights,\nAnd springs in the midst of the\

    19: "¹⁹ I will put the cedar in the wilderness,\nThe acacia, the myrtle, and the\

    10: "¹⁰ You felt secure in your wickedness and said,\n‘No one sees me,’\nYour\

    11: "¹¹ But evil will come on you\nWhich you will not know how to charm away;\n\

    3: "³ I declared the former things long ago,\nAnd they went out of My mouth, and\

    7: "⁷ They are created now and not long ago;\nAnd before today you have not heard\

    5: "⁵ And now says the Lord, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant,\n\

    9: "⁹ Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord;\nAwake as in the days\

  53:
    1: "¹ Who has believed our report?\nAnd to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\n"

    2: "² “Enlarge the place of your tent;\nStretch out the curtains of your dwellings,\

    11: "¹¹ “Of whom were you worried and fearful\nWhen you lied, and did not remember\

    14: "¹⁴ And it will be said,\n“Build up, build up, prepare the way,\nRemove every\

      \ and lowly of spirit\nIn order to revive the spirit of the lowly\nAnd to revive\
      \ the heart of the contrite.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For I will not contend forever,\nNor will I always be angry;\nFor the\

    17: "¹⁷ Because of the wrongful act of his unjust gain I was angry and struck\
      \ him;\nI hid My face and was angry,\nAnd he went on turning away, in the way\

    20: "²⁰ But the wicked are like the tossing sea,\nFor it cannot be quiet,\nAnd\

      They ask Me for just decisions,\nThey delight in the nearness of God.\n"
    3: "³ ‘Why have we fasted and You do not see?\nWhy have we humbled ourselves and\
      \ You do not notice?’\nBehold, on the day of your fast you find your desire,\n\
      And oppress all your workers.\n"
    4: "⁴ Behold, you fast for contention and strife, and to strike with a wicked\
      \ fist.\nYou do not fast like you have done today to make your voice heard on\
      \ high!\n"
    5: "⁵ Is it a fast like this that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself?\n\
      Is it for bowing one’s head like a reed\nAnd for spreading out sackcloth and\
      \ ashes as a bed?\nWill you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the\
      \ Lord?\n"
    6: "⁶ Is this not the fast that I choose:\nTo release the bonds of wickedness,\n\
      To undo the ropes of the yoke,\nAnd to let the oppressed go free,\nAnd break\
      \ every yoke?\n"
    7: "⁷ Is it not to break your bread with the hungry\nAnd bring the homeless poor\
      \ into the house;\nWhen you see the naked, to cover him;\nAnd not to hide yourself\
      \ from your own flesh?\n"
    8: "⁸ Then your light will break out like the dawn,\nAnd your recovery will spring\

    9: "⁹ Then you will call, and the Lord will answer;\nYou will cry for help, and\

    13: "¹³ “If, because of the Sabbath, you restrain your foot\nFrom doing as you\

    3: "³ For your hands are defiled with blood,\nAnd your fingers with wrongdoing;\n\

    4: "⁴ No one sues righteously and no one pleads honestly.\nThey trust in confusion\

    9: "⁹ Therefore justice is far from us,\nAnd righteousness does not reach us;\n\
      We hope for light, but there is darkness,\nFor brightness, but we walk in gloom.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ We grope for the wall like people who are blind,\nWe grope like those\

    12: "¹² For our wrongful acts have multiplied before You,\nAnd our sins have testified\

    15: "¹⁵ Truth is lacking,\nAnd one who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey.\n\
      Now the Lord saw,\nAnd it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And He saw that there was no one,\nAnd was amazed that there was not one\
      \ to intercede;\nThen His own arm brought salvation to Him,\nAnd His righteousness\
      \ upheld Him.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He put on righteousness like a breastplate,\nAnd a helmet of salvation\
      \ on His head;\nAnd He put on garments of vengeance for clothing\nAnd wrapped\
      \ Himself with zeal as a cloak.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ According to their deeds, so will He repay:\nWrath to His adversaries,\
      \ retribution to His enemies;\nTo the coastlands He will deal retribution.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ So they will fear the name of the Lord from the west\nAnd His glory from\

    6: "⁶ But you will be called the priests of the Lord;\nYou will be spoken of as\
      \ ministers of our God.\nYou will eat the wealth of nations,\nAnd you will boast\
      \ in their riches.\n"
    7: "⁷ Instead of your shame you will have a double portion,\nAnd instead of humiliation\
      \ they will shout for joy over their portion.\nTherefore they will possess a\
      \ double portion in their land,\nEverlasting joy will be theirs.\n"
    8: "⁸ For I, the Lord, love justice,\nI hate robbery in the burnt offering;\n\
      And I will faithfully give them their reward,\nAnd make an everlasting covenant\
      \ with them.\n"
    9: "⁹ Then their offspring will be known among the nations,\nAnd their descendants\
      \ in the midst of the peoples.\nAll who see them will recognize them\nBecause\
      \ they are the offspring whom the Lord has blessed. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ I will rejoice greatly in the Lord,\nMy soul will be joyful in my God;\n\
      For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,\nHe has wrapped me with a\
      \ robe of righteousness,\nAs a groom puts on a turban,\nAnd as a bride adorns\
      \ herself with her jewels.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For as the earth produces its sprouts,\nAnd as a garden causes the things\
      \ sown in it to spring up,\nSo the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise\n\
      To spring up before all the nations."
  62:
    1: "¹ For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,\nAnd for Jerusalem’s sake I will\
      \ not keep quiet,\nUntil her righteousness goes forth like brightness,\nAnd\
      \ her salvation like a torch that is burning.\n"
    2: "² The nations will see your righteousness,\nAnd all kings your glory;\nAnd\
      \ you will be called by a new name\nWhich the mouth of the Lord will designate.\n"
    3: "³ You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,\nAnd a royal\
      \ headband in the hand of your God.\n"
    4: "⁴ It will no longer be said to you, “Forsaken,”\nNor to your land will it\
      \ any longer be said, “Desolate”;\nBut you will be called, “My delight is in\
      \ her,”\nAnd your land, “Married”;\nFor the Lord delights in you,\nAnd to Him\
      \ your land will be married.\n"
    5: "⁵ For as a young man marries a virgin,\nSo your sons will marry you;\nAnd\
      \ as the groom rejoices over the bride,\nSo your God will rejoice over you.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ On your walls, Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen;\nAll day and all night\
      \ they will never keep silent.\nYou who profess the Lord, take no rest for yourselves;\n"
    7: "⁷ And give Him no rest until He establishes\nAnd makes Jerusalem an object\
      \ of praise on the earth.\n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm:\n“I will never\
      \ again give your grain as food for your enemies,\nNor will foreigners drink\
      \ your new wine for which you have labored.”\n"
    9: "⁹ But those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord;\nAnd those who\
      \ gather it will drink it in the courtyards of My sanctuary. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Go through, go through the gates,\nClear a way for the people!\nBuild\
      \ up, build up the highway,\nRemove the stones, lift up a flag over the peoples.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth:\nSay to the daughter\
      \ of Zion, “Behold, your salvation is coming;\nBehold His reward is with Him,\
      \ and His compensation before Him.”\n"
    12: "¹² And they will call them, “The holy people,\nThe redeemed of the Lord”;\n\
      And you will be called, “Sought Out, A City Not Abandoned.”"
  63:
    1: "¹ Who is this who comes from Edom,\nWith garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,\n\
      This One who is majestic in His apparel,\nMarching in the greatness of His strength?\n\
      “It is I, the One who speaks in righteousness, mighty to save.”\n"
    2: "² Why is Your apparel red,\nAnd Your garments like one who treads in the wine\
      \ press?\n"
    3: "³ “I have trodden the wine trough alone,\nAnd from the peoples there was no\
      \ one with Me.\nI also trod them in My anger\nAnd trampled them in My wrath;\n\
      And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,\nAnd I stained all My clothes.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the day of vengeance was in My heart,\nAnd My year of redemption has\
      \ come.\n"
    5: "⁵ I looked, but there was no one to help,\nAnd I was astonished and there\
      \ was no one to uphold;\nSo My own arm brought salvation to Me,\nAnd My wrath\
      \ upheld Me.\n"
    6: "⁶ I trampled down the peoples in My anger\nAnd made them drunk with My wrath,\n\
      And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.” \n"
    7: "⁷ I will make mention of the mercies of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord,\n\
      According to all that the Lord has granted us,\nAnd the great goodness toward\
      \ the house of Israel,\nWhich He has granted them according to His compassion\n\
      And according to the abundance of His mercies.\n"
    8: "⁸ For He said, “Certainly they are My people,\nSons who will not deal falsely.”\n\
      So He became their Savior.\n"
    9: "⁹ In all their distress He was distressed,\nAnd the angel of His presence\
      \ saved them;\nIn His love and in His mercy He redeemed them,\nAnd He lifted\
      \ them and carried them all the days of old.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But they rebelled\nAnd grieved His Holy Spirit;\nTherefore He turned Himself\
      \ to become their enemy,\nHe fought against them.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses.\nWhere is He who\
      \ brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock?\nWhere is\
      \ He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them,\n"
    12: "¹² Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses,\nWho divided\
      \ the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name,\n"
    13: "¹³ Who led them through the depths?\nLike the horse in the wilderness, they\
      \ did not stumble;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Like the cattle which go down into the valley,\nThe Spirit of the Lord\
      \ gave them rest.\nSo You led Your people,\nTo make for Yourself a glorious\
      \ name. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious lofty habitation;\n\
      Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds?\nThe stirrings of Your heart and\
      \ Your compassion are restrained toward me.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us\nAnd Israel does\
      \ not recognize us.\nYou, Lord, are our Father,\nOur Redeemer from ancient times\
      \ is Your name.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Why, Lord, do You cause us to stray from Your ways\nAnd harden our heart\
      \ from fearing You?\nReturn for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your\
      \ heritage.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while,\nOur adversaries\
      \ have trampled it down.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ We have become like those over whom You have never ruled,\nLike those\
      \ who were not called by Your name."
  64:
    1: "¹ Oh, that You would tear open the heavens and come down,\nThat the mountains\
      \ would quake at Your presence—\n"
    2: "² As fire kindles brushwood, as fire causes water to boil—\nTo make Your name\
      \ known to Your adversaries,\nThat the nations may tremble at Your presence!\n"
    3: "³ When You did awesome things which we did not expect,\nYou came down, the\
      \ mountains quaked at Your presence.\n"
    4: "⁴ For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear,\nNor has the\
      \ eye seen a God besides You,\nWho acts in behalf of one who waits for Him.\n"
    5: "⁵ You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness,\nWho remembers You in\
      \ Your ways.\nBehold, You were angry, for we sinned,\nWe continued in our sins\
      \ for a long time;\nYet shall we be saved?\n"
    6: "⁶ For all of us have become like one who is unclean,\nAnd all our righteous\
      \ deeds are like a filthy garment;\nAnd all of us wither like a leaf,\nAnd our\
      \ wrongdoings, like the wind, take us away.\n"
    7: "⁷ There is no one who calls on Your name,\nWho stirs himself to take hold\
      \ of You;\nFor You have hidden Your face from us\nAnd have surrendered us to\
      \ the power of our wrongdoings. \n"
    8: "⁸ But now, Lord, You are our Father;\nWe are the clay, and You our potter,\n\
      And all of us are the work of Your hand.\n"
    9: "⁹ Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord,\nNor remember wrongdoing forever.\n\
      Behold, please look, all of us are Your people.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Your holy cities have become a wilderness,\nZion has become a wilderness,\n\
      Jerusalem a desolation.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Our holy and beautiful house,\nWhere our fathers praised You,\nHas been\
      \ burned by fire;\nAnd all our precious things have become a ruin.\n"
    12: "¹² Will You restrain Yourself at these things, Lord?\nWill You keep silent\
      \ and afflict us beyond measure?"
  65:
    1: "¹ “I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me;\nI permitted\
      \ Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me.\nI said, ‘Here am I, here\
      \ am I,’\nTo a nation which did not call on My name.\n"
    2: "² I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people,\nWho walk\
      \ in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts,\n"
    3: "³ A people who continually provoke Me to My face,\nOffering sacrifices in\
      \ gardens and burning incense on bricks;\n"
    4: "⁴ Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places;\nWho eat pig’s\
      \ flesh,\nAnd the broth of unclean meat is in their pots.\n"
    5: "⁵ Who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near me,\nFor I am holier than you!’\n\
      These are smoke in My nostrils,\nA fire that burns all the day.\n"
    6: "⁶ Behold, it is written before Me:\nI will not keep silent, but I will repay;\n\
      I will even repay into their laps,\n"
    7: "⁷ Both your own wrongdoings and the wrongdoings of your fathers together,”\
      \ says the Lord.\n“Because they have burned incense on the mountains\nAnd scorned\
      \ Me on the hills,\nTherefore I will measure their former work into their laps.”\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ This is what the Lord says:\n“Just as the new wine is found in the cluster,\n\
      And one says, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is benefit in it,’\nSo I will act\
      \ in behalf of My servants\nIn order not to destroy all of them.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bring forth offspring from Jacob,\nAnd an heir of My mountains from\
      \ Judah;\nMy chosen ones shall inherit it,\nAnd My servants will live there.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks,\nAnd the Valley of Achor a resting\
      \ place for herds,\nFor My people who seek Me.\n"
    11: "¹¹ But as for you who abandon the Lord,\nWho forget My holy mountain,\nWho\
      \ set a table for Fortune,\nAnd fill a jug of mixed wine for Destiny,\n"
    12: "¹² I will destine you for the sword,\nAnd all of you will bow down to the\
      \ slaughter.\nBecause I called, but you did not answer;\nI spoke, but you did\
      \ not listen.\nInstead, you did evil in My sight\nAnd chose that in which I\
      \ did not delight.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:\n“Behold, My servants will\
      \ eat, but you will be hungry.\nBehold, My servants will drink, but you will\
      \ be thirsty.\nBehold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Behold, My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart,\nBut you will\
      \ cry out from a painful heart,\nAnd you will wail from a broken spirit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You will leave your name as a curse to My chosen ones,\nAnd the Lord God\
      \ will put you to death.\nBut My servants will be called by another name.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Because the one who is blessed on the earth\nWill be blessed by the God\
      \ of truth;\nAnd the one who swears an oath on the earth\nWill swear by the\
      \ God of truth;\nBecause the former troubles are forgotten,\nAnd because they\
      \ are hidden from My sight! \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;\nAnd the former things\
      \ will not be remembered or come to mind.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create;\nFor behold, I create\
      \ Jerusalem for rejoicing\nAnd her people for gladness.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people;\nAnd there\
      \ will no longer be heard in her\nThe voice of weeping and the sound of crying.\n"
    20: "²⁰ No longer will there be in it an infant who lives only a few days,\nOr\
      \ an old person who does not live out his days;\nFor the youth will die at the\
      \ age of a hundred,\nAnd the one who does not reach the age of a hundred\nWill\
      \ be thought accursed.\n"
    21: "²¹ They will build houses and inhabit them;\nThey will also plant vineyards\
      \ and eat their fruit.\n"
    22: "²² They will not build and another inhabit,\nThey will not plant and another\
      \ eat;\nFor as the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,\nAnd\
      \ My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.\n"
    23: "²³ They will not labor in vain,\nOr give birth to children for disaster;\n\
      For they are the descendants of those blessed by the Lord,\nAnd their descendants\
      \ with them. \n"
    24: '²⁴ It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; while
      they are still speaking, I will listen. '
    25: ²⁵ The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw
      like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no evil or harm
      on all My holy mountain,” says the Lord.
  66:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“Heaven is My throne and the earth is the footstool\
      \ for My feet.\nWhere then is a house you could build for Me?\nAnd where is\
      \ a place that I may rest?\n"
    2: "² For My hand made all these things,\nSo all these things came into being,”\
      \ declares the Lord.\n“But I will look to this one,\nAt one who is humble and\
      \ contrite in spirit, and who trembles at My word. \n"
    3: "³ “But the one who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a person;\nThe one\
      \ who sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck;\nOne who offers\
      \ a grain offering is like one who offers pig’s blood;\nOne who burns incense\
      \ is like one who blesses an idol.\nAs they have chosen their own ways,\nAnd\
      \ their souls delight in their abominations,\n"
    4: "⁴ So I will choose their punishments\nAnd bring on them what they dread.\n\
      Because I called, but no one answered;\nI spoke, but they did not listen.\n\
      Instead, they did evil in My sight\nAnd chose that in which I did not delight.”\n"
    5: "⁵ Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word:\n“Your brothers\
      \ who hate you, who exclude you on account of My name,\nHave said, ‘Let the\
      \ Lord be glorified, so that we may see your joy.’\nBut they will be put to\
      \ shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ A sound of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple,\nThe voice of\
      \ the Lord who is dealing retribution to His enemies. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Before she was in labor, she delivered;\nBefore her pain came, she gave\
      \ birth to a boy.\n"
    8: "⁸ Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things?\nCan a land be born\
      \ in one day?\nCan a nation be given birth all at once?\nAs soon as Zion was\
      \ in labor, she also delivered her sons.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I bring to the point of birth but not give delivery?” says the Lord.\n\
      “Or shall I who gives delivery shut the womb?” says your God. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her;\n\
      Be exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over her,\n"
    11: "¹¹ So that you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts,\n\
      So that you may drink fully and be delighted with her bountiful breasts.”\n"
    12: "¹² For this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I extend peace to her like a\
      \ river,\nAnd the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;\nAnd you\
      \ will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and rocked back and forth on\
      \ the knees.\n"
    13: "¹³ As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you;\nAnd you will\
      \ be comforted in Jerusalem.”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then you will see this, and your heart will be glad,\nAnd your bones will\
      \ flourish like the new grass;\nAnd the hand of the Lord will be made known\
      \ to His servants,\nBut He will be indignant toward His enemies.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For behold, the Lord will come in fire,\nAnd His chariots like the whirlwind,\n\
      To render His anger with fury,\nAnd His rebuke with flames of fire.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For the Lord will execute judgment by fire\nAnd by His sword on humanity,\n\
      And those put to death by the Lord will be many.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go to the gardens,\nFollowing\
      \ one in the center,\nWho eat pig’s flesh, detestable things, and mice,\nWill\
      \ come to an end altogether,” declares the Lord. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “For I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather
      all the nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory. '
    19: '¹⁹ And I will put a sign among them and send survivors from them to the nations:
      Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal, and Javan, to the distant coastlands that
      have neither heard of My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory
      among the nations. '
    20: '²⁰ Then they shall bring all your countrymen from all the nations as a grain
      offering to the Lord, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels,
      to My holy mountain Jerusalem,” says the Lord, “just as the sons of Israel bring
      their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord. '
    21: "²¹ I will also take some of them as priests and Levites,” says the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    22: "²² “For just as the new heavens and the new earth,\nWhich I make, will endure\

    23: "²³ And it shall be from new moon to new moon\nAnd from Sabbath to Sabbath,\n\
      All mankind will come to bow down before Me,” says the Lord.\n"
    24: "²⁴ “Then they will go out and look\nAt the corpses of the people\nWho have\
      \ rebelled against Me.\nFor their worm will not die\nAnd their fire will not\
      \ be extinguished;\nAnd they will be an abhorrence to all mankind.”"
