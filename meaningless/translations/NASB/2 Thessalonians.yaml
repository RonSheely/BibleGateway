2 Thessalonians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,\nTo the church of the Thessalonians in God\
      \ our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: "
    2: "² Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    3: '³ We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters, as
      is only fitting, because your faith is increasing abundantly, and the love of
      each and every one of you toward one another grows ever greater. '
    4: '⁴ As a result, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God
      for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions
      which you endure. '
    5: '⁵ This is a plain indication of God’s righteous judgment so that you will
      be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you indeed are suffering. '
    6: '⁶ For after all it is only right for God to repay with affliction those who
      afflict you, '
    7: '⁷ and to give relief to you who are afflicted, along with us, when the Lord
      Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels '
    8: '⁸ in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God, and
      to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. '
    9: '⁹ These people will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the
      presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, '
    10: '¹⁰ when He comes to be glorified among His saints on that day, and to be
      marveled at among all who have believed—because our testimony to you was believed. '
    11: '¹¹ To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will consider you
      worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of
      faith with power, '
    12: ¹² so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in
      Him, in accordance with the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
  2:
    1: '¹ Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus
      Christ and our gathering together to Him, '
    2: '² that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either
      by a spirit, or a message, or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the
      day of the Lord has come. '
    3: '³ No one is to deceive you in any way! For it will not come unless the apostasy
      comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, '
    4: '⁴ who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship,
      so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being
      God. '
    5: '⁵ Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these
      things? '
    6: '⁶ And you know what restrains him now, so that he will be revealed in his
      time. '
    7: '⁷ For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains
      will do so until He is removed. '
    8: '⁸ Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will eliminate with
      the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; '
    9: '⁹ that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with
      all power and false signs and wonders, '
    10: '¹⁰ and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because
      they did not accept the love of the truth so as to be saved. '
    11: '¹¹ For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they
      will believe what is false, '
    12: "¹² in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but\
      \ took pleasure in wickedness. \n"
    13: '¹³ But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters
      beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation
      through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. '
    14: '¹⁴ It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may obtain
      the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. '
    15: "¹⁵ So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold on to the traditions\
      \ which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved
      us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, '
    17: ¹⁷ comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.
  3:
    1: '¹ Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the word of the Lord will
      spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it was also with you; '
    2: '² and that we will be rescued from troublesome and evil people; for not all
      have the faith. '
    3: '³ But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the
      evil one. '
    4: '⁴ We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing, and will
      do, what we command. '
    5: "⁵ May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the perseverance\
      \ of Christ. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, that you keep away from every brother or sister who leads a disorderly
      life and not one in accordance with the tradition which you received from us. '
    7: '⁷ For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we
      did not act in an undisciplined way among you, '
    8: '⁸ nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with labor and
      hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any
      of you; '
    9: '⁹ not because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves
      as a role model for you, so that you would follow our example. '
    10: '¹⁰ For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone
      is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. '
    11: '¹¹ For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing
      no work at all, but acting like busybodies. '
    12: '¹² Now we command and exhort such persons in the Lord Jesus Christ to work
      peacefully and eat their own bread. '
    13: "¹³ But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary of doing good.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note
      of that person so as not to associate with him, so that he will be put to shame. '
    15: "¹⁵ And yet do not regard that person as an enemy, but admonish that one as\
      \ a brother or sister. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every\
      \ circumstance. The Lord be with you all! \n"
    17: '¹⁷ I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing
      mark in every letter; this is the way I write. '
    18: ¹⁸ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
