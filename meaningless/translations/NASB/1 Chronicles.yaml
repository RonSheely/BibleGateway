      the gatekeepers for the camp of the sons of Levi. '
    19: '¹⁹ Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his
      relatives of his father’s house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of
      the service, doorkeepers of the tent; and their fathers had been in charge of
      the camp of the Lord, keepers of the entrance. '
    20: '²⁰ Phinehas the son of Eleazar was supervisor over them previously, and the
      Lord was with him. '
    21: '²¹ Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper of the entrance of the
      tent of meeting. '
    22: '²² Those who were chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds were 212 in
      all. They were registered by genealogy in their settlements, those whom David
      and Samuel the seer appointed in their official capacity. '
    23: '²³ So they and their sons were in charge of the gates of the house of the
      Lord, the house of the tent, in their divisions of service. '
    24: '²⁴ The gatekeepers were on the four sides, to the east, west, north, and
      south. '
    25: '²⁵ Their relatives in their settlements were to come in every seven days
      from time to time to be with them; '
    26: '²⁶ for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, served in an official
      capacity, and were in charge of the chambers and in charge of the treasuries
      in the house of God. '
    27: "²⁷ They spent the night around the house of God, because the watch was committed\
      \ to them; and they were in charge of opening it morning by morning. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Now some of them were in charge of the utensils of the service, for they
      counted them when they brought them in and when they took them out. '
    29: '²⁹ Some of them also were appointed over the furniture and over all the utensils
      of the sanctuary, and over the finely milled flour, the wine, the olive oil,
      the frankincense, and the balsam oil. '
    30: '³⁰ Some of the sons of the priests prepared the mixing of the balsam oil. '
    31: '³¹ Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite,
      had the responsibility for the baking of cakes in pans. '
    32: "³² Some of their relatives of the sons of the Kohathites were in charge of\
      \ the showbread to prepare it every Sabbath. \n"
    33: '³³ Now these are the singers, heads of fathers’ households of the Levites,
      who lived in the chambers of the temple free of other duties; for they were
      engaged in their work day and night. '
    34: "³⁴ These were heads of fathers’ households of the Levites according to their\
      \ generations, chief men who lived in Jerusalem. \n"
    35: '³⁵ Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon, and his wife’s name was Maacah, '
    36: '³⁶ and his firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, '
    37: '³⁷ Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. '
    38: '³⁸ Mikloth fathered Shimeam. And they also lived with their relatives in
      Jerusalem opposite their other relatives. '
    39: '³⁹ Ner fathered Kish, Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-shua,
      Abinadab, and Eshbaal. '
    40: '⁴⁰ The son of Jonathan was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal fathered Micah. '
    41: '⁴¹ The sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. '
    42: '⁴² Ahaz fathered Jarah, Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and
      Zimri fathered Moza. '
    43: '⁴³ Moza fathered Binea, and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his
      son. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Azel had six sons whose names were these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah,
      Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.'
  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from
      the Philistines but fell fatally wounded on Mount Gilboa. '
    2: '² And the Philistines also overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines
      killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. '
    3: '³ The battle became severe against Saul, and the archers found him; and he
      was wounded by the archers. '
    4: '⁴ Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through
      with it, otherwise these uncircumcised Philistines will come and abuse me.”
      But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his own
      sword and fell on it. '
    5: '⁵ When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword
      and died. '
    6: "⁶ So Saul died with his three sons, and all those of his house died together.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ When all the people of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled,\
      \ and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled;\
      \ and the Philistines came and lived in them. \n"
    8: '⁸ It came about the next day, when the Philistines came to strip those killed,
      that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. '
    9: '⁹ So they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent messengers
      around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and
      to the people. '
    10: "¹⁰ They put his armor in the house of their gods and impaled his head in\
      \ the house of Dagon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When all Jabesh-gilead heard everything that the Philistines had done
      to Saul, '
    12: "¹² all the valiant men got up and took away the body of Saul and the bodies\
      \ of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh; and they buried their bones under\
      \ the oak in Jabesh, and fasted for seven days. \n"
    13: '¹³ So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he committed against the Lord,
      because of the word of the Lord which he did not keep; and also because he asked
      counsel of a medium, making inquiry of her, '
    14: ¹⁴ and did not inquire of the Lord. Therefore He killed him and turned the
      kingdom over to David, the son of Jesse.
  11:
    1: '¹ Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your
      bone and your flesh. '
    2: '² In times past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led out and
      brought in Israel; and the Lord your God said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My
      people Israel, and you shall be leader over My people Israel.’” '
    3: "³ So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a\
      \ covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king\
      \ over Israel, in accordance with the word of the Lord through Samuel. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); and the Jebusites,
      the inhabitants of the land, were there. '
    5: '⁵ The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not enter here.” Nevertheless
      David took the mountain stronghold of Zion (that is, the city of David). '
    6: '⁶ Now David had said, “Whoever is first to kill a Jebusite shall be chief
      and commander.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. '
    7: '⁷ Then David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of
      David. '
    8: '⁸ He built the city all around, from the Millo to the surrounding area; and
      Joab repaired the rest of the city. '
    9: "⁹ And David became greater and greater, for the Lord of armies was with him.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now these are the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who remained
      faithful to him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king,
      in accordance with the word of the Lord concerning Israel. '
    11: "¹¹ These constitute the list of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam, the son of\
      \ a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he wielded his spear against three\
      \ hundred whom he killed at one time. \n"
    12: '¹² After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the
      three mighty men. '
    13: '¹³ He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered together
      there to battle, and there was a plot of land full of barley; and the people
      fled from the Philistines. '
    14: "¹⁴ But they took their stand in the midst of the plot and defended it, and\
      \ defeated the Philistines; and the Lord saved them with a great victory. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into
      the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camping in the Valley
      of Rephaim. '
    16: '¹⁶ David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines
      was then in Bethlehem. '
    17: '¹⁷ And David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water
      to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” '
    18: '¹⁸ So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water
      from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took it and brought it
      to David; however, David would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord; '
    19: "¹⁹ and he said, “Far be it from me before my God that I would do this. Shall\
      \ I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? For they\
      \ brought it at the risk of their lives.” Therefore he would not drink it. The\
      \ three mighty men did these things. \n"
    20: '²⁰ As for Abshai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the thirty, and he
      wielded his spear against three hundred and killed them; and he had a name as
      well as the thirty. '
    21: "²¹ Of the three in the second rank he was the most honored, and he became\
      \ their commander; however, he did not attain the reputation of the first three.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a warrior of Kabzeel, mighty in
      deeds, struck and killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and
      struck and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day. '
    23: '²³ And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature five cubits tall. Now
      in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam, but he went down to
      him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him
      with his own spear. '
    24: '²⁴ Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name as well as
      the three mighty men. '
    25: "²⁵ Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain the reputation\
      \ of the first three; and David appointed him over his bodyguard. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now the mighty men of the armies were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan
      the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, '
    27: '²⁷ Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, '
    28: '²⁸ Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, '
    29: '²⁹ Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, '
    30: '³⁰ Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, '
    31: '³¹ Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the
      Pirathonite, '
    32: '³² Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, '
    33: '³³ Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, '
    34: '³⁴ the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, '
    35: '³⁵ Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, '
    36: '³⁶ Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, '
    37: '³⁷ Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, '
    38: '³⁸ Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, '
    39: '³⁹ Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the
      son of Zeruiah, '
    40: '⁴⁰ Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, '
    41: '⁴¹ Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, '
    42: '⁴² Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty
      with him, '
    43: '⁴³ Hanan the son of Maacah and Joshaphat the Mithnite, '
    44: '⁴⁴ Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, '
    45: '⁴⁵ Jediael the son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite, '
    46: '⁴⁶ Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah
      the Moabite, '
    47: ⁴⁷ Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
  12:
    1: '¹ Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still restricted
      because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men who helped
      him in war. '
    2: '² They were equipped with bows, using both the right hand and the left to
      sling stones and shoot arrows with the bow; they were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin. '
    3: '³ The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and
      Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite, '
    4: '⁴ and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and in charge
      of the thirty. Then Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite, '
    5: '⁵ Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite, '
    6: '⁶ Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korahites, '
    7: "⁷ and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. \n"
    8: '⁸ From the Gadites valiant mighty men went over to David at the stronghold
      in the wilderness, men trained for war who could handle a large shield and spear,
      whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles
      on the mountains. '
    9: '⁹ Ezer was the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, '
    10: '¹⁰ Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, '
    11: '¹¹ Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, '
    12: '¹² Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, '
    13: '¹³ Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai, the eleventh. '
    14: '¹⁴ These men from the sons of Gad were captains of the army; the one who
      was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest, to a thousand. '
    15: "¹⁵ These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it\
      \ was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys,\
      \ to the east and to the west. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to
      David. '
    17: '¹⁷ David went out to meet them, and said to them, “If you come peacefully
      to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies,
      since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look on it and
      decide.” '
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Spirit covered Amasai like clothing, the chief of the thirty;\
      \ and he said,\n“We are yours, David,\nAnd are with you, son of Jesse!\nPeace,\
      \ peace to you,\nAnd peace to him who helps you;\nIndeed, your God helps you!”\n\
      Then David received them and made them captains of the troops. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ From Manasseh some also defected to David when he was about to go to battle
      with the Philistines against Saul. But they did not help them, because the governors
      of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “At the cost of
      our heads he might defect to his master Saul.” '
    20: '²⁰ As he was going to Ziklag, men from Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad,
      Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who belonged
      to Manasseh. '
    21: '²¹ They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all valiant
      mighty men, and were captains in the army. '
    22: "²² For day by day men came to David to help him, until there was a great\
      \ army like the army of God. \n"
    23: '²³ Now these are the numbers of the divisions equipped for war, who came
      to David at Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word
      of the Lord. '
    24: '²⁴ The sons of Judah who carried shield and spear numbered 6,800, equipped
      for war. '
    25: '²⁵ From the sons of Simeon, valiant mighty men of war, 7,100. '
    26: '²⁶ From the sons of Levi, 4,600. '
    27: '²⁷ Now Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron, and with him were 3,700, '
    28: '²⁸ also Zadok, a young valiant mighty man, and from his father’s house, twenty-two
      captains. '
    29: '²⁹ From the sons of Benjamin, Saul’s kinsmen, three thousand; for until now
      the majority of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. '
    30: '³⁰ From the sons of Ephraim 20,800, valiant mighty men, famous men in their
      fathers’ households. '
    31: '³¹ From the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated
      by name to come and make David king. '
    32: '³² From the sons of Issachar, men who understood the times, with knowledge
      of what Israel should do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their kinsmen
      were at their command. '
    33: '³³ From Zebulun, there were fifty thousand who went out in the army, who
      could draw up in battle formation with all kinds of weapons of war and helped
      David with an undivided heart. '
    34: '³⁴ From Naphtali there were a thousand captains, and with them thirty-seven
      thousand with shield and spear. '
    35: '³⁵ From the Danites who could draw up in battle formation, there were 28,600. '
    36: '³⁶ From Asher there were forty thousand who went out in the army to draw
      up in battle formation. '
    37: "³⁷ From the other side of the Jordan, from the Reubenites, the Gadites, and\
      \ the half-tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 with all kinds of weapons of\
      \ war for the battle. \n"
    38: '³⁸ All of these, being men of war who helped in battle formation, came to
      Hebron with a perfect heart to make David king over all Israel; and all the
      rest of Israel also were of one mind to make David king. '
    39: '³⁹ They were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their
      kinsmen had prepared for them. '
    40: ⁴⁰ Moreover, those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and
      Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and on oxen, great quantities
      of flour cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep.
      There was joy indeed in Israel.
  13:
    1: '¹ Then David consulted with the captains of the thousands and the hundreds,
      with every leader. '
    2: '² David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and
      if it is from the Lord our God, let us send word everywhere to our kinsmen who
      remain in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are with
      them in their cities with pasture lands, that they meet with us; '
    3: '³ and let us bring back the ark of our God to us, since we did not seek it
      in the days of Saul.” '
    4: "⁴ Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for this was right in\
      \ the eyes of all the people. \n"
    5: '⁵ So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor of Egypt to the
      entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. '
    6: '⁶ David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which
      belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the Lord who is enthroned
      above the cherubim, where His name is called. '
    7: '⁷ And they carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab,
      and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. '
    8: "⁸ David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, with\
      \ songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. \n"
    9: '⁹ When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to
      hold the ark, because the oxen nearly overturned it. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the anger of the Lord burned against Uzza, so He struck him because
      he had put out his hand toward the ark; and he died there before God. '
    11: '¹¹ Then David became angry because of the Lord’s outburst against Uzza; and
      he called that place Perez-uzza as it is to this day. '
    12: '¹² David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of
      God home to me?” '
    13: '¹³ So David did not take the ark with him to the city of David, but took
      it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. '
    14: ¹⁴ And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for
      three months; and the Lord blessed the family of Obed-edom and all that he had.
  14:
    1: '¹ Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons,
      and carpenters, to build a house for him. '
    2: "² And David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel,\
      \ and that his kingdom was highly exalted, for the sake of His people Israel.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and
      daughters. '
    4: '⁴ These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab,
      Nathan, Solomon, '
    5: '⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, '
    6: '⁶ Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, '
    7: "⁷ Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. \n"
    8: '⁸ When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel,
      all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard about it and
      went out against them. '
    9: '⁹ Now the Philistines had come and carried out a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. '
    10: '¹⁰ David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines?
      And will You hand them over to me?” Then the Lord said to him, “Go up, for I
      will hand them over to you.” '
    11: '¹¹ So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and David
      said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of
      waters.” Therefore they named that place Baal-perazim. '
    12: "¹² They abandoned their gods there; so David gave the order and they were\
      \ burned with fire. \n"
    13: '¹³ The Philistines carried out yet another raid in the valley. '
    14: '¹⁴ David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “You shall not go up
      after them; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the baka-shrubs. '
    15: '¹⁵ When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baka-shrubs, then
      you shall go out to battle, for God will have gone out before you to strike
      the army of the Philistines.” '
    16: '¹⁶ David did just as God had commanded him, and they defeated the army of
      the Philistines from Gibeon even as far as Gezer. '
    17: ¹⁷ Then the fame of David spread in all the lands; and the Lord brought the
      fear of him on all the nations.
  15:
    1: '¹ Now David built houses for himself in the city of David; and he prepared
      a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. '
    2: '² Then David said, “No one is to carry the ark of God except the Levites;
      for the Lord chose them to carry the ark of the Lord and to serve Him forever.” '
    3: '³ And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord
      to its place which he had prepared for it. '
    4: '⁴ David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: '
    5: '⁵ of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his relatives; '
    6: '⁶ of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and 220 of his relatives; '
    7: '⁷ of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and 130 of his relatives; '
    8: '⁸ of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two hundred of his relatives; '
    9: '⁹ of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and eighty of his relatives; '
    10: "¹⁰ of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and 112 of his relatives.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David called for the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and for the Levites,
      for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab; '
    12: '¹² and he said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of
      the Levites; consecrate yourselves, you and your relatives, so that you may
      bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel to the place that I have prepared
      for it. '
    13: '¹³ Because you did not carry it at the first, the Lord our God made an outburst
      against us, since we did not seek Him according to the ordinance.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the
      ark of the Lord God of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ The sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with\
      \ the poles on them, just as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives
      as the singers, with musical instruments, harps, lyres, and cymbals, playing
      to raise sounds of joy. '
    17: '¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and from his relatives,
      Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan
      the son of Kushaiah, '
    18: '¹⁸ and with them their relatives of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel,
      Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu,
      Mikneiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers. '
    19: '¹⁹ So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound aloud
      cymbals of bronze; '
    20: '²⁰ and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and
      Benaiah, with harps tuned to alamoth; '
    21: '²¹ and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to
      lead with lyres tuned to the sheminith. '
    22: '²² Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing; he gave
      instruction in singing because he was skillful. '
    23: '²³ Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. '
    24: "²⁴ Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer,\
      \ the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah\
      \ also were gatekeepers for the ark. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So it was David, with the elders of Israel and the captains of thousands,
      who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom
      with joy. '
    26: '²⁶ Because God was helping the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. '
    27: '²⁷ Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen with all the Levites who
      were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the singing
      with the singers. David also wore an ephod of linen. '
    28: "²⁸ So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting,\
      \ and with the sound of the horn, with trumpets, with loud-sounding cymbals,\
      \ with harps, and lyres. \n"
    29: ²⁹ When the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, Michal
      the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and
      celebrating; and she despised him in her heart.
  16:
    1: '¹ And they brought in the ark of God and placed it inside the tent which David
      had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before
      God. '
    2: '² When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings,
      he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. '
    3: "³ Then he distributed to everyone of Israel, both men and women, to everyone\
      \ a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a raisin cake. \n"
    4: '⁴ He appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the Lord,
      to celebrate and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel: '
    5: '⁵ Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
      Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with musical instruments,
      harps, and lyres; also Asaph played loud-sounding cymbals, '
    6: "⁶ and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew trumpets continually before the\
      \ ark of the covenant of God. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then on that day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks\
      \ to the Lord. \n"
    8: "⁸ Give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name;\nMake His deeds known among\
      \ the peoples.\n"
    9: "⁹ Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;\nSpeak of all His wonders.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Boast in His holy name;\nLet the heart of those who seek the Lord be joyful.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Seek the Lord and His strength;\nSeek His face continually.\n"
    12: "¹² Remember His wonderful deeds which He has done,\nHis marvels and the judgments\
      \ from His mouth,\n"
    13: "¹³ You descendants of Israel His servant,\nSons of Jacob, His chosen ones!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God;\nHis judgments are in all the earth.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Remember His covenant forever,\nThe word which He commanded to a thousand\
      \ generations,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The covenant which He made with Abraham,\nAnd His oath to Isaac.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He also confirmed it to Jacob as a statute,\nTo Israel as an everlasting\
      \ covenant,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,\nAs the portion of your\
      \ inheritance.”\n"
    19: "¹⁹ When they were only a few in number,\nVery few, and strangers in it,\n"
    20: "²⁰ And they wandered from nation to nation,\nAnd from one kingdom to another\
      \ people,\n"
    21: "²¹ He allowed no one to oppress them,\nAnd He rebuked kings for their sakes,\
      \ saying,\n"
    22: "²² “Do not touch My anointed ones,\nAnd do not harm My prophets.”\n"
    23: "²³ Sing to the Lord, all the earth;\nProclaim good news of His salvation\
      \ from day to day.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Tell of His glory among the nations,\nHis wonderful deeds among all the\
      \ peoples.\n"
    25: "²⁵ For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;\nHe also is to be feared\
      \ above all gods.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For all the gods of the peoples are idols,\nBut the Lord made the heavens.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Splendor and majesty are before Him,\nStrength and joy are in His place.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Ascribe to the Lord, you families of the peoples,\nAscribe to the Lord\
      \ glory and strength.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name;\nBring an offering, and come\
      \ before Him;\nWorship the Lord in holy attire.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Tremble before Him, all the earth;\nIndeed, the world is firmly established,\
      \ it will not be moved.\n"
    31: "³¹ Let the heavens be joyful, and the earth rejoice;\nAnd let them say among\
      \ the nations, “The Lord reigns.”\n"
    32: "³² Let the sea roar, and everything it contains;\nLet the field rejoice,\
      \ and everything that is in it.\n"
    33: "³³ Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy in the presence of the\
      \ Lord;\nFor He is coming to judge the earth.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good;\nFor His faithfulness is everlasting.\n"
    35: "³⁵ Then say, “Save us, God of our salvation,\nAnd gather us and save us from\
      \ the nations,\nTo give thanks to Your holy name,\nAnd glory in Your praise.”\n"
    36: "³⁶ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,\nFrom everlasting to everlasting!\n\
      Then all the people said, “Amen,” and praised the Lord. \n"
    37: '³⁷ So he left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required, '
    38: '³⁸ and Obed-edom with his sixty-eight relatives; Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun,
      and Hosah as gatekeepers. '
    39: '³⁹ He left Zadok the priest and his relatives the priests before the tabernacle
      of the Lord in the high place which was at Gibeon, '
    40: '⁴⁰ to offer burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering continually
      morning and evening, even according to everything that is written in the Law
      of the Lord, which He commanded Israel. '
    41: '⁴¹ With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were
      designated by name, to give thanks to the Lord, because His kindness is everlasting. '
    42: "⁴² And with them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those\
      \ who were to play them, and with instruments for the songs of God, and the\
      \ sons of Jeduthun for the gate. \n"
    43: ⁴³ Then all the people departed, each to his house; and David returned to
      bless his household.
  17:
    1: '¹ And it came about, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan
      the prophet, “Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord is under tent curtains.” '
    2: "² Then Nathan said to David, “Do whatever is in your heart, for God is with\
      \ you.” \n"
    3: '³ But it happened that same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, '
    4: '⁴ “Go and tell David My servant, ‘This is what the Lord says: “You shall not
      build a house for Me to dwell in; '
    5: '⁵ for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to
      this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from one dwelling place to another. '
    6: '⁶ In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word
      with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying,
      ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’ '
    7: '⁷ Now, therefore, this is what you shall say to My servant David: ‘This is
      what the Lord of armies says: “I took you from the pasture, from following the
      sheep, to be leader over My people Israel. '
    8: '⁸ I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have eliminated all your
      enemies from you; and I will make for you a name like the name of the great
      ones who are on the earth. '
    9: '⁹ And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them there,
      so that they may live in their own place and not tremble with anxiety again;
      and the wicked will not make them waste away anymore as they did previously, '
    10: "¹⁰ even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel.\
      \ And I will subdue all your enemies.\nMoreover, I tell you that the Lord will\
      \ build a house for you. "
    11: '¹¹ When your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers,
      then I will set up one of your descendants after you, who will be from your
      sons; and I will establish his kingdom. '
    12: '¹² He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My favor
      away from him, as I took it from him who was before you. '
    14: '¹⁴ But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne
      will be established forever.”’” '
    15: "¹⁵ According to all these words and according to all of this vision, so Nathan\
      \ spoke to David. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then King David came in and sat before the Lord, and said, “Who am I,
      Lord God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far? '
    17: '¹⁷ This was a small thing in Your eyes, God; but You have spoken of Your
      servant’s house for a great while to come, and have viewed me according to the
      standard of a person of high degree, Lord God. '
    18: '¹⁸ What more can David still say to You concerning the honor bestowed on
      Your servant? For You know Your servant. '
    19: '¹⁹ Lord, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have
      accomplished all this greatness, to make known all these great things. '
    20: '²⁰ Lord, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according
      to everything that we have heard with our ears. '
    21: '²¹ And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God
      went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for You a name by great and
      awesome things, by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed
      from Egypt? '
    22: "²² For You have made Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You,\
      \ Lord, became their God. \n"
    23: '²³ “Now, Lord, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant
      and concerning his house be established forever, and do just as You have spoken. '
    24: '²⁴ Let Your name be established and be great forever, saying, ‘The Lord of
      armies is the God of Israel, a God to Israel; and the house of Your servant
      David is established before You.’ '
    25: '²⁵ For You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him
      a house; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray before You. '
    26: '²⁶ Now, Lord, You are God, and have promised this good thing to Your servant. '
    27: ²⁷ And now You have decided to bless the house of Your servant, that it may
      continue forever before You; for You, Lord, have blessed, and it is blessed
      forever.”
  18:
    1: '¹ Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued
      them and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines. '
    2: "² And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing\
      \ tribute. \n"
    3: '³ David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath, as he went
      to establish his rule to the river Euphrates. '
    4: "⁴ David took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and\
      \ twenty thousand foot soldiers, and David hamstrung almost all the chariot\
      \ horses, but left enough of them for a hundred chariots. \n"
    5: '⁵ When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David
      killed twenty-two thousand men of the Arameans. '
    6: '⁶ Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus; and the Arameans
      became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the Lord helped David wherever
      he went. '
    7: '⁷ And David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of
      Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ Also from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a very large\
      \ amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea and the pillars and\
      \ the bronze utensils. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of
      Hadadezer king of Zobah, '
    10: '¹⁰ he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because
      he had fought against Hadadezer and had defeated him; for Hadadezer had been
      at war with Tou. And Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver
      and bronze. '
    11: "¹¹ King David also dedicated these to the Lord, with the silver and the gold\
      \ which he had carried away from all the nations: from Edom, Moab, the sons\
      \ of Ammon, the Philistines, and from Amalek. \n"
    12: '¹² Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah defeated eighteen thousand Edomites
      in the Valley of Salt. '
    13: "¹³ Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to\
      \ David. And the Lord helped David wherever he went. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and righteousness
      for all his people. '
    15: '¹⁵ Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of
      Ahilud was secretary; '
    16: '¹⁶ and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests,
      and Shavsha was secretary; '
    17: ¹⁷ and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites,
      and the sons of David were chiefs at the king’s side.
  19:
    1: '¹ Now it came about after this, that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon
      died, and his son became king in his place. '
    2: '² Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because
      his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning
      his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to
      Hanun to console him. '
    3: '³ But the commanders among the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think
      that David is honoring your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Have
      his servants not come to you to search, to demolish, and to spy out the land?” '
    4: '⁴ So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them, and cut off their robes
      in the middle as far as their buttocks, and sent them away. '
    5: "⁵ Then certain people went and told David about the men. And he sent messengers\
      \ to meet them, because the men were very humiliated. And the king said, “Stay\
      \ at Jericho until your beards grow back, then return.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David,
      Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves
      chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. '
    7: '⁷ So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king
      of Maacah and his people, who came and camped opposite Medeba. And the sons
      of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to the battle. '
    8: '⁸ When David heard about it, he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men. '
    9: "⁹ The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance\
      \ of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him at the front and
      at the rear, he selected warriors from all the choice men in Israel and lined
      them up against the Arameans. '
    11: '¹¹ But the remainder of the people he placed under the command of Abshai
      his brother; and they lined up against the sons of Ammon. '
    12: '¹² He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me;
      but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. '
    13: '¹³ Be strong, and let’s show ourselves courageous for the benefit of our
      people and the cities of our God; and may the Lord do what is good in His sight.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to battle against the
      Arameans, and they fled from him. '
    15: "¹⁵ When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled\
      \ from his brother Abshai and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent
      messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River,
      with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them. '
    17: '¹⁷ When it was reported to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed
      the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. And when
      David drew up in battle formation against the Arameans, they fought against
      him. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed of the Arameans seven
      thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers; and he put Shophach the
      commander of the army to death. '
    19: ¹⁹ So when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel,
      they made peace with David and served him. So the Arameans were not willing
      to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
  20:
    1: '¹ Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle,
      that Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the sons of Ammon, and came
      and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and
      overthrew it. '
    2: '² David took the crown of their king from his head, and he found it to weigh
      a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it; and it was placed on
      David’s head. And he brought out the spoils of the city, a very great amount. '
    3: "³ He brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work at saws,\
      \ iron picks, and axes. And David did the same to all the cities of the sons\
      \ of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now it came about after this, that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines;
      then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants,
      and they were subdued. '
    5: '⁵ And there was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan the son of Jair
      killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was
      like a weaver’s beam. '
    6: '⁶ Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who
      had twenty-four fingers and toes, six fingers on each hand and six toes on each
      foot; and he also was descended from the giants. '
    7: '⁷ When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed
      him. '
    8: ⁸ These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of
      David and by the hand of his servants.
  21:
    1: '¹ Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count Israel. '
    2: '² So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, count Israel
      from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me word so that I may know their number.” '
    3: '³ But Joab said, “May the Lord add to His people a hundred times as many as
      they are! My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why does my
      lord seek this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?” '
    4: '⁴ Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore, Joab departed
      and went throughout Israel, and came to Jerusalem. '
    5: '⁵ Then Joab gave the number of the census of the people to David. Israel was
      1,100,000 men in all who drew the sword; and Judah was 470,000 men who drew
      the sword. '
    6: "⁶ But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, because the king’s command\
      \ was abhorrent to Joab. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now God was displeased with this thing, so He struck Israel. '
    8: "⁸ David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, by doing this thing. But now,\
      \ please overlook Your servant’s guilt, for I have behaved very foolishly.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ The Lord spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, '
    10: '¹⁰ “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘This is what the Lord says: “I extend
      to you three choices; choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you.”’” '
    11: '¹¹ So Gad came to David and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Take
      for yourself '
    12: '¹² three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes
      while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword
      of the Lord: a plague in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout
      the territory of Israel.’ Now, therefore, consider what answer I shall bring
      back to Him who sent me.” '
    13: "¹³ David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; please let me fall into the\
      \ hand of the Lord, for His mercies are very great. But do not let me fall into\
      \ human hands.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord sent a plague on Israel; seventy thousand men of Israel fell. '
    15: '¹⁵ And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about
      to destroy it, the Lord saw and was sorry about the catastrophe, and said to
      the destroying angel, “It is enough; now relax your hand.” And the angel of
      the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then David raised his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between
      earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.
      Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces. '
    17: "¹⁷ And David said to God, “Is it not I who commanded to count the people?\
      \ Indeed, I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly, but these sheep,\
      \ what have they done? Lord, my God, just let Your hand be against me and my\
      \ father’s household, and not against Your people as a plague.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David, that David was
      to go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the
      Jebusite. '
    19: '¹⁹ So David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the
      Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ Now Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with
      him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat. '
    21: '²¹ As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out from
      the threshing floor and prostrated himself to David with his face to the ground. '
    22: '²² Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of this threshing floor, so
      that I may build on it an altar to the Lord; you shall give it to me for the
      full price, so that the plague may be brought to a halt from the people.” '
    23: '²³ But Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and may my lord the king
      do what is good in his sight. See, I am giving the oxen for burnt offerings,
      and the threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the grain offering; I am
      giving it all.” '
    24: '²⁴ Nevertheless, King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will certainly buy
      it for the full price; for I will not take what is yours for the Lord, nor offer
      a burnt offering which costs me nothing.” '
    25: '²⁵ So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site. '
    26: '²⁶ Then David built an altar there to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings
      and peace offerings. And he called to the Lord, and He answered him with fire
      from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. '
    27: "²⁷ The Lord commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing
      floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifice there. '
    29: '²⁹ For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness,
      and the altar of burnt offering were on the high place at Gibeon at that time. '
    30: ³⁰ But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was terrified
      by the sword of the angel of the Lord.
  22:
    1: "¹ Then David said, “This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar\
      \ of burnt offering for Israel.” \n"
    2: '² So David gave orders to gather the strangers who were in the land of Israel,
      and he set stonecutters to cut out stones to build the house of God. '
    3: '³ And David prepared large quantities of iron to make the nails for the doors
      of the gates and for the clamps, and more bronze than could be weighed; '
    4: '⁴ and timbers of cedar beyond number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought
      large quantities of cedar timber to David. '
    5: "⁵ David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that\
      \ is to be built for the Lord shall be exceedingly magnificent, famous, and\
      \ glorious throughout the lands. Therefore I now will make preparations for\
      \ it.” So David made ample preparations before his death. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he called for his son Solomon, and commanded him to build a house for
      the Lord God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ David said to Solomon, “My son, I had intended to build a house for the
      name of the Lord my God. '
    8: '⁸ But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and
      have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to My name, because you have
      shed so much blood on the earth before Me. '
    9: '⁹ Behold, a son will be born to you, who shall be a man of rest, and I will
      give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon,
      and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. '
    10: '¹⁰ He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son and I will
      be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ '
    11: '¹¹ Now, my son, the Lord be with you that you may be successful, and build
      the house of the Lord your God just as He has spoken concerning you. '
    12: '¹² Only the Lord give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge
      of Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the Lord your God. '
    13: '¹³ Then you will prosper, if you are careful to follow the statutes and the
      ordinances which the Lord commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous,
      do not fear nor be dismayed. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the Lord
      a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver, and bronze
      and iron beyond measure, for they are in great quantity; I have also prepared
      timber and stone, and you may add to that. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moreover there are many workmen with you, stonecutters, masons of stone,
      and carpenters; and all of them are skillful in every kind of work. '
    16: "¹⁶ Of the gold, silver, bronze, and iron there is no limit. Arise and work,\
      \ and may the Lord be with you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon,
      saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ “Is the Lord your God not with you? And has He not given you rest on every
      side? For He has handed over to me the inhabitants of the land, and the land
      is subdued before the Lord and before His people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; then arise,
      and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so that you may bring the ark of the
      covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be
      built for the name of the Lord.”
  23:
    1: '¹ Now when David reached old age, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. '
    2: "² And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and\
      \ the Levites. \n"
    3: '³ Now the Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward, and their
      number by head count of men was thirty-eight thousand. '
    4: '⁴ Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of
      the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges, '
    5: '⁵ and four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand were praising the
      Lord with the instruments which David made for giving praise. '
    6: "⁶ David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon,\
      \ Kohath, and Merari. \n"
    7: '⁷ Of the Gershonites there were Ladan and Shimei. '
    8: '⁸ The sons of Ladan were Jehiel the first, and Zetham and Joel, three. '
    9: '⁹ The sons of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were
      the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan. '
    10: '¹⁰ The sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were
      the sons of Shimei. '
    11: "¹¹ Jahath was the first and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not\
      \ have many sons, so they became a father’s household, one group for duty. \n"
    12: '¹² The sons of Kohath were four in number: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. '
    13: '¹³ The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to sanctify
      him as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the Lord,
      to serve Him and bless in His name forever. '
    14: '¹⁴ But as for Moses, the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe
      of Levi. '
    15: '¹⁵ The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer. '
    16: '¹⁶ The son of Gershom was Shebuel the chief. '
    17: '¹⁷ The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons,
      but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. '
    18: '¹⁸ The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief. '
    19: '¹⁹ The sons of Hebron were Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel
      the third, and Jekameam the fourth. '
    20: "²⁰ The sons of Uzziel were Micah the first and Isshiah the second. \n"
    21: '²¹ The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar
      and Kish. '
    22: '²² Eleazar died and had no sons, but only daughters; so their relatives,
      the sons of Kish, took them as wives. '
    23: "²³ The sons of Mushi were three: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth. \n"
    24: '²⁴ These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers’ households, the
      heads of the fathers’ households of those among them who were counted, in the
      number of names by their head count, doing the work for the service of the house
      of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward. '
    25: '²⁵ For David said, “The Lord God of Israel has given rest to His people,
      and He dwells in Jerusalem forever. '
    26: '²⁶ Also, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all
      its utensils for its service.” '
    27: '²⁷ For by the last words of David, the sons of Levi were counted from twenty
      years old and upward. '
    28: '²⁸ For their office is to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the
      house of the Lord, in the courtyards and in the chambers, and in the purification
      of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God, '
    29: '²⁹ and with the showbread, and the fine flour for a grain offering, and unleavened
      wafers, or what is baked in the pan or what is well-mixed, and all measures
      of volume and size. '
    30: '³⁰ They are to stand every morning to thank and to praise the Lord, and likewise
      at evening, '
    31: '³¹ and to offer all burnt offerings to the Lord, on the Sabbaths, the new
      moons and the appointed festivals, in the number determined by the ordinance
      concerning them, continually before the Lord. '
    32: ³² So they are to perform the duties of the tent of meeting, the holy place,
      and of assisting the sons of Aaron their relatives, for the service of the house
      of the Lord.
  24:
    1: '¹ Now the divisions of the descendants of Aaron were these: the sons of Aaron
      were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. '
    2: '² But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no sons. So Eleazar
      and Ithamar served as priests. '
    3: '³ David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar,
      divided them according to their offices for their ministry. '
    4: '⁴ Since more chief men were found from the descendants of Eleazar than the
      descendants of Ithamar, they divided them this way: there were sixteen heads
      of fathers’ households of the descendants of Eleazar, and eight of the descendants
      of Ithamar according to their fathers’ households. '
    5: '⁵ So they were divided by lot, the one as the other; for they were officers
      of the sanctuary and officers of God, both from the descendants of Eleazar and
      the descendants of Ithamar. '
    6: "⁶ Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them\
      \ in the presence of the king, the leaders, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the\
      \ son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and\
      \ the Levites; one father’s household taken for Eleazar and one taken for Ithamar.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ Now the first lot came out for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah, '
    8: '⁸ the third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim, '
    9: '⁹ the fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin, '
    10: '¹⁰ the seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah, '
    11: '¹¹ the ninth for Jeshua, the tenth for Shecaniah, '
    12: '¹² the eleventh for Eliashib, the twelfth for Jakim, '
    13: '¹³ the thirteenth for Huppah, the fourteenth for Jeshebeab, '
    14: '¹⁴ the fifteenth for Bilgah, the sixteenth for Immer, '
    15: '¹⁵ the seventeenth for Hezir, the eighteenth for Happizzez, '
    16: '¹⁶ the nineteenth for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezkel, '
    17: '¹⁷ the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul, '
    18: '¹⁸ the twenty-third for Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth for Maaziah. '
    19: "¹⁹ These were their offices for their ministry when they entered the house\
      \ of the Lord according to the ordinance given to them through their father\
      \ Aaron, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now for the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of
      the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. '
    21: '²¹ Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah, the first. '
    22: '²² Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. '
    23: '²³ The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the
      third, Jekameam the fourth. '
    24: '²⁴ Of the sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. '
    25: '²⁵ The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. '
    26: '²⁶ The sons of Merari, Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, Beno. '
    27: '²⁷ The sons of Merari: by Jaaziah were Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. '
    28: '²⁸ By Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. '
    29: '²⁹ By Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel. '
    30: '³⁰ The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the
      Levites according to their fathers’ households. '
    31: ³¹ These also cast lots just as their relatives, the sons of Aaron did in
      the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’
      households of the priests and of the Levites—the head of fathers’ households
      as well as those of his younger brother.
  25:
    1: '¹ Moreover, David and the commanders of the army set apart for the service
      some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with lyres,
      harps, and cymbals; and the number of those who performed this service was: '
    2: '² Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah; the sons
      of Asaph were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction
      of the king. '
    3: '³ Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah,
      and Mattithiah, six in all, under the direction of their father Jeduthun with
      the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel and Jerimoth,
      Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi,
      Hothir, and Mahazioth. '
    5: '⁵ All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer to exalt him according
      to the words of God, for God gave fourteen sons and three daughters to Heman. '
    6: '⁶ All of these were under the direction of their father to sing in the house
      of the Lord, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, for the service of the house of
      God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the direction of the king. '
    7: "⁷ Their number who were trained in singing to the Lord, with their relatives,\
      \ all who were skillful, was 288. \n"
    8: "⁸ They cast lots for their duties, all alike, the small as well as the great,\
      \ the teacher as well as the pupil. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph, the second for Gedaliah,
      he with his relatives and sons were twelve; '
    10: '¹⁰ the third to Zaccur, his sons and his relatives, twelve; '
    11: '¹¹ the fourth to Izri, his sons and his relatives, twelve; '

    19: '¹⁹ the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his relatives, twelve; '
    20: '²⁰ for the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons and his relatives, twelve; '
    21: '²¹ for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his relatives, twelve; '
    22: '²² for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his relatives, twelve; '

    31: ³¹ for the twenty-fourth to Romamti-ezer, his sons and his relatives, twelve.
  26:
    1: '¹ For the divisions of the gatekeepers there were of the Korahites, Meshelemiah
      the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. '
    2: '² Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah
      the third, Jathniel the fourth, '
    3: '³ Elam the fifth, Johanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh. '
    4: '⁴ Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the
      third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, '
    5: '⁵ Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; God had
      indeed blessed him. '
    6: '⁶ Also to his son Shemaiah sons were born who ruled over the house of their
      father, for they were valiant mighty men. '
    7: '⁷ The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers,
      Elihu and Semachiah, were valiant men. '
    8: '⁸ All these were of the sons of Obed-edom; they and their sons and relatives
      were able men with strength for the service, sixty-two from Obed-edom. '
    9: '⁹ Meshelemiah had sons and relatives, eighteen valiant men. '
    10: '¹⁰ Also Hosah, one of the sons of Merari had sons: Shimri the first (although
      he was not the firstborn, his father made him first), '
    11: "¹¹ Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth; the\
      \ sons and relatives of Hosah were thirteen in all. \n"
    12: '¹² To these divisions of the gatekeepers, to the chief men, were given duties
      like their relatives, to serve in the house of the Lord. '
    13: '¹³ They cast lots, the small and the great alike, according to their fathers’
      households, for every gate. '
    14: '¹⁴ The lot to the east fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son
      Zechariah, a counselor with insight, and his lot came out to the north. '
    15: '¹⁵ For Obed-edom it fell to the south, and to his sons went the storehouse. '
    16: '¹⁶ For Shuppim and Hosah it was to the west, by the gate of Shallecheth,
      on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard. '
    17: '¹⁷ On the east there were six Levites, on the north four daily, on the south
      four daily, and at the storehouse two by two. '
    18: '¹⁸ At the annex on the west there were four at the highway and two at the
      annex. '
    19: "¹⁹ These were the divisions of the gatekeepers of the sons of Korah and of\
      \ the sons of Merari. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The Levites, their relatives, were in charge of the treasures of the house
      of God and of the treasures of the dedicated gifts. '
    21: "²¹ The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, namely,\
      \ the Jehielites, were the heads of the fathers’ households, belonging to Ladan\
      \ the Gershonite. \n"
    22: '²² The sons of Jehieli, Zetham, and his brother Joel, were in charge of the
      treasures of the house of the Lord. '
    23: '²³ As for the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites, '
    24: '²⁴ Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was officer over the treasures. '
    25: '²⁵ His relatives by Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram
      his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. '
    26: '²⁶ This Shelomoth and his relatives were in charge of all the treasures of
      the dedicated gifts which King David and the heads of the fathers’ households,
      the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had
      dedicated. '
    27: '²⁷ They dedicated part of the spoils won in battles to repair the house of
      the Lord. '
    28: "²⁸ And all that Samuel the seer had dedicated, and Saul the son of Kish,\
      \ Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, everyone who had dedicated\
      \ anything, all of this was under the care of Shelomoth and his relatives. \n"
    29: '²⁹ As for the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were assigned to outside
      duties for Israel, as officers and judges. '
    30: '³⁰ As for the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his relatives, 1,700 capable men,
      were responsible for the affairs of Israel west of the Jordan, for all the work
      of the Lord and the service of the king. '
    31: '³¹ As for the Hebronites, Jerijah the chief (these Hebronites were sought
      out according to their genealogies and fathers’ households, in the fortieth
      year of David’s reign, and men of outstanding capability were found among them
      at Jazer of Gilead) '
    32: ³² and his relatives, capable men, numbered 2,700, heads of fathers’ households.
      And King David appointed them as overseers of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and
      the half-tribe of the Manassites concerning all the affairs of God and of the
      king.
  27:
    1: "¹ Now this is the number of the sons of Israel, the heads of fathers’ households,\
      \ the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served\

    5: '⁵ The third commander of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son
      of Jehoiada the priest, as chief; and in his division were twenty-four thousand. '
    6: '⁶ This Benaiah was the mighty man of the thirty, and was in charge of thirty;
      and over his division was his son Ammizabad. '

    15: "¹⁵ The twelfth, for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite of Othniel;\

    16: '¹⁶ Now in charge of the tribes of Israel: chief officer for the Reubenites
      was Eliezer the son of Zichri; for the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah; '
    17: '¹⁷ for Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; for Aaron, Zadok; '

    22: '²² for Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes
      of Israel. '
    23: '²³ But David did not count those twenty years of age and under, because the
      Lord had said He would multiply Israel as the stars of heaven. '
    24: "²⁴ Joab the son of Zeruiah had begun to count them, but did not finish; and\
      \ because of this, wrath came upon Israel, and the number was not included in\
      \ the account of the chronicles of King David. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now Azmaveth the son of Adiel was responsible for the king’s storehouses.
      And Jonathan the son of Uzziah was responsible for the storehouses in the country,
      the cities, the villages, and the towers. '

    31: "³¹ Jaziz the Hagrite was responsible for the flocks. All these were overseers\

    32: '³² Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding,
      and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni tutored the king’s sons. '
    33: '³³ Ahithophel was counselor to the king; and Hushai the Archite was the king’s
      friend. '
    34: ³⁴ Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar succeeded Ahithophel; and Joab
      was the commander of the king’s army.
  28:
    1: '¹ Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the leaders
      of the tribes, and the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the
      commanders of thousands, and the commanders of hundreds, and the overseers of
      all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, with the
      officials and the mighty men, all the valiant warriors. '
    2: '² Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and
      my people; I had intended to build a permanent home for the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord and for the footstool of our God. So I had made preparations to
      build it. '
    3: '³ But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name, because you
      are a man of war and have shed blood.’ '
    4: '⁴ Yet, the Lord, the God of Israel, chose me from all the household of my
      father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be a leader;
      and in the house of Judah, my father’s house, and among the sons of my father
      He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel. '
    5: '⁵ Of all my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons), He has chosen my son
      Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. '
    6: '⁶ He said to me, ‘Your son Solomon is the one who shall build My house and
      My courtyards; for I have chosen him to be a son to Me, and I will be a Father
      to him. '
    7: '⁷ I will establish his kingdom forever if he resolutely performs My commandments
      and My ordinances, as is done now.’ '
    8: "⁸ So now, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and in the\
      \ presence of our God, keep and seek after all the commandments of the Lord\
      \ your God so that you may possess the good land and leave it as an inheritance\
      \ to your sons after you forever. \n"
    9: '⁹ “As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him
      wholeheartedly and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts, and
      understands every intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will let you find
      Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever. '
    10: "¹⁰ Consider now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary;\
      \ be courageous and act.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David gave to his son Solomon the plan of the porch of the temple,
      its buildings, its storehouses, its upper rooms, its inner rooms, and the room
      for the atoning cover; '
    12: '¹² and the plan of all that he had in mind, for the courtyards of the house
      of the Lord, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the storehouses of the house
      of God and for the storehouses of the dedicated things; '
    13: '¹³ also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites and for all the
      work of the service of the house of the Lord and for all the utensils of service
      in the house of the Lord; '
    14: '¹⁴ for the golden utensils, by weight of gold for all utensils for every
      service; for all the silver utensils, by weight of silver for all utensils for
      every service; '
    15: '¹⁵ and the weight of gold for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps,
      with the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for
      the silver lampstands, with the weight of each lampstand and its lamps according
      to the use of each lampstand; '
    16: '¹⁶ and the gold by weight for the tables of the showbread, for each table;
      and silver for the silver tables; '
    17: '¹⁷ and the forks, the basins, and the pitchers of pure gold; and for the
      golden bowls with the weight for each bowl; and for the silver bowls with the
      weight for each bowl; '
    18: "¹⁸ and for the altar of incense, refined gold by weight; and gold for the\
      \ model of the chariot, and the cherubim that spread out their wings and covered\
      \ the ark of the covenant of the Lord. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “All this,” said David, “the Lord made me understand in writing by His\
      \ hand upon me, all the details of this pattern.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous, and act;
      do not fear nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will
      not fail you nor forsake you until all the work for the service of the house
      of the Lord is finished. '
    21: ²¹ Now behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for
      all the service of the house of God, and every willing man of any skill will
      be with you in all the work for all kinds of service. The officials also and
      all the people will be entirely at your command.”
  29:
    1: '¹ Then King David said to the entire assembly, “My son Solomon, whom alone
      God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and the work is great; for
      the temple is not for mankind, but for the Lord God. '
    2: '² Now with all my ability I have provided for the house of my God the gold
      for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for
      the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, wood for the things of
      wood, onyx stones and inlaid stones, stones of antimony and stones of various
      colors, and all kinds of precious stones and alabaster in abundance. '
    3: '³ In addition, in my delight in the house of my God, the treasure I have of
      gold and silver, I give to the house of my God, over and above all that I have
      already provided for the holy temple, '
    4: '⁴ namely, three thousand talents of gold, from the gold of Ophir, and seven
      thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings; '
    5: "⁵ gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver, that is,\
      \ for all the work done by the craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate\
      \ himself this day to the Lord?” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the rulers of the fathers’ households, the leaders of the tribes of
      Israel, and the commanders of thousands and hundreds, with the supervisors of
      the king’s work, offered willingly; '
    7: '⁷ and for the service of the house of God they gave five thousand talents
      and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand
      talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron. '
    8: '⁸ Whoever possessed precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house
      of the Lord, in care of Jehiel the Gershonite. '
    9: "⁹ Then the people rejoiced because they had offered so willingly, for they\
      \ made their offering to the Lord wholeheartedly, and King David also rejoiced\
      \ greatly. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ So David blessed the Lord in the sight of all the assembly; and David
      said, “Blessed are You, Lord God of Israel our father, forever and ever. '
    11: '¹¹ Yours, Lord, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and
      the majesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and on the earth; Yours
      is the dominion, Lord, and You exalt Yourself as head over all. '
    12: '¹² Both riches and honor come from You, and You rule over all, and in Your
      hand is power and might; and it lies in Your hand to make great and to strengthen
      everyone. '
    13: "¹³ Now therefore, our God, we thank You, and praise Your glorious name. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to offer as
      generously as this? For all things come from You, and from Your hand we have
      given to You. '
    15: '¹⁵ For we are strangers before You, and temporary residents, as all our fathers
      were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope. '
    16: '¹⁶ Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided to build You a
      house for Your holy name, it is from Your hand, and everything is Yours. '
    17: '¹⁷ Since I know, my God, that You put the heart to the test and delight in
      uprightness, I, in the integrity of my heart, have willingly offered all these
      things; so now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here, make
      their offerings willingly to You. '
    18: '¹⁸ Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever
      in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts to You; '
    19: "¹⁹ and give my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments, Your\
      \ testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do them all, and to build the temple\
      \ for which I have made provision.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the Lord your God.” And\
      \ all the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers, and bowed down\
      \ and paid homage to the Lord and the king. \n"
    21: '²¹ On the next day they made sacrifices to the Lord and offered burnt offerings
      to the Lord, a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their
      drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. '
    22: "²² So they ate and drank that day before the Lord with great gladness.\n\
      And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and they anointed\
      \ him as ruler for the Lord and Zadok as priest. "
    23: '²³ Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of his father
      David; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. '
    24: '²⁴ And all the officials, the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David
      pledged allegiance to King Solomon. '
    25: "²⁵ The Lord highly honored Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed\
      \ on him royal majesty which had not been bestowed on any king before him in\
      \ Israel. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. '
    27: "²⁷ The period which he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned in\
      \ Hebron seven years and in Jerusalem thirty-three years. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then he died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and his
      son Solomon reigned in his place. '
    29: '²⁹ Now the acts of King David, from the first to the last, are written in
      the chronicles of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet,
      and in the chronicles of Gad the seer, '
    30: ³⁰ with all of his reign, his power, and the circumstances which came upon
      him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the lands.
