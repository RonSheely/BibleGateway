Obadiah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The vision of Obadiah.\nThis is what the Lord God says concerning Edom—\n\
      We have heard a report from the Lord,\nAnd a messenger has been sent among the\
      \ nations saying,\n“Arise, and let’s go up against her for battle”—\n"
    2: "² “Behold, I will make you small among the nations;\nYou are greatly despised.\n"
    3: "³ The arrogance of your heart has deceived you,\nThe one who lives in the\
      \ clefts of the rock,\nOn the height of his dwelling place,\nWho says in his\
      \ heart,\n‘Who will bring me down to earth?’\n"
    4: "⁴ Though you make your home high like the eagle,\nThough you set your nest\
      \ among the stars,\nFrom there I will bring you down,” declares the Lord.\n"
    5: "⁵ “If thieves came to you,\nIf robbers by night—\nOh how you will be ruined!—\n\
      Would they not steal only until they had enough?\nIf grape-pickers came to you,\n\
      Would they not leave some gleanings?\n"
    6: "⁶ Oh how Esau will be searched,\nAnd his hidden treasures searched out!\n"
    7: "⁷ All the people allied with you\nWill send you to the border,\nAnd the people\
      \ at peace with you\nWill deceive you and overpower you.\nThey who eat your\
      \ bread\nWill set an ambush for you.\n(There is no understanding in him.)\n"
    8: "⁸ Will I not on that day,” declares the Lord,\n“Eliminate wise men from Edom,\n\
      And understanding from the mountain of Esau?\n"
    9: "⁹ Then your warriors will be filled with terror, Teman,\nSo that everyone\
      \ will be eliminated from the mountain of Esau by murder. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Because of violence to your brother Jacob,\nShame will cover you,\nAnd\
      \ you will be eliminated forever.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On the day that you stood aloof,\nOn the day that strangers carried off\
      \ his wealth,\nAnd foreigners entered his gate\nAnd cast lots for Jerusalem—\n\
      You too were as one of them.\n"
    12: "¹² Do not gloat over your brother’s day,\nThe day of his misfortune.\nAnd\
      \ do not rejoice over the sons of Judah\nOn the day of their destruction;\n\
      Yes, do not boast\nOn the day of their distress.\n"
    13: "¹³ Do not enter the gate of My people\nOn the day of their disaster.\nYou\
      \ indeed, do not gloat over their catastrophe\nOn the day of their disaster.\n\
      And do not lay a hand on their wealth\nOn the day of their disaster.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Do not stand at the crossroads\nTo eliminate their survivors;\nAnd do\
      \ not hand over their refugees\nOn the day of their distress. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “For the day of the Lord is near for all the nations.\nJust as you have\
      \ done, it will be done to you.\nYour dealings will return on your own head.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For just as you drank on My holy mountain,\nAll the nations will drink\
      \ continually.\nThey will drink to the last drop,\nAnd become as if they had\
      \ never existed.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape,\nAnd it will be holy.\n\
      And the house of Jacob will possess their property.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the house of Jacob will be a fire,\nAnd the house of Joseph a flame;\n\
      But the house of Esau will be like stubble.\nAnd they will set them on fire\
      \ and consume them,\nSo that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau,”\n\
      For the Lord has spoken.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then those of the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau,\nAnd those\
      \ of the Shephelah the Philistine plain;\nAlso, they will possess the territory\
      \ of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,\nAnd Benjamin the territory of Gilead.\n"
    20: "²⁰ And the exiles of this army of the sons of Israel,\nWho are among the\
      \ Canaanites as far as Zarephath,\nAnd the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad,\n\
      Will possess the cities of the Negev.\n"
    21: "²¹ The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion\nTo judge the mountain of Esau,\n\
      And the kingdom will be the Lord’s."
