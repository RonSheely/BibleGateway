Deuteronomy:
  1:
    1: '¹ These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in
      the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban,
      Hazeroth, and Dizahab. '
    2: '² It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. '
    3: '³ In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke
      to the sons of Israel, in accordance with everything that the Lord had commanded
      him to declare to them, '
    4: '⁴ after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon,
      and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. '
    5: "⁵ Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this Law,\
      \ saying, \n"
    6: '⁶ “The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough
      at this mountain. '
    7: '⁷ Turn and set out on your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites,
      and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland,
      in the Negev, by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far
      as the great river, the river Euphrates. '
    8: "⁸ See, I have placed the land before you; go in and take possession of the\
      \ land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and\
      \ to Jacob, and their descendants after them.’ \n"
    9: '⁹ “And I spoke to you at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to endure you alone. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day like
      the stars of heaven in number. '
    11: '¹¹ May the Lord, the God of your fathers increase you a thousand times more
      than you are, and bless you, just as He has promised you! '
    12: '¹² How can I alone endure the burden and weight of you and your strife? '
    13: '¹³ Obtain for yourselves men who are wise, discerning, and informed from
      your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.’ '
    14: '¹⁴ And you answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have said to do is
      good.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and informed men, and appointed\
      \ them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens,\
      \ and officers for your tribes. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Then I ordered your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between
      your fellow countrymen and judge righteously between a person and his fellow
      countryman, or the stranger who is with him. '
    17: '¹⁷ You are not to show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and
      the great alike. You are not to be afraid of any person, for the judgment is
      God’s. The case that is too difficult for you, you shall bring to me, and I
      will hear it.’ '
    18: "¹⁸ At that time I commanded you all the things that you were to do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible
      wilderness that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just
      as the Lord our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. '
    20: '²⁰ And I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites,
      which the Lord our God is about to give us. '
    21: "²¹ See, the Lord your God has placed the land before you; go up, take possession,\
      \ just as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear\
      \ or be dismayed.’ \n"
    22: '²² “Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us,
      so that they may spy out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way
      by which we should go up, and the cities which we should enter.’ '
    23: '²³ The plan pleased me, and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe. '
    24: '²⁴ Then they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley
      of Eshcol, and spied it out. '
    25: "²⁵ And they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought\
      \ it down to us. They also brought us back a report and said, ‘The land that\
      \ the Lord our God is about to give us is good.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Yet you were unwilling to go up; instead you rebelled against the command
      of the Lord your God; '
    27: '²⁷ and you grumbled in your tents and said, ‘Because the Lord hates us, He
      has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to
      destroy us. '
    28: '²⁸ Where can we go up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, by saying,
      “The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified
      up to heaven. And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there.”’ '
    29: '²⁹ But I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, nor fear them. '
    30: '³⁰ The Lord your God, who goes before you, will Himself fight for you, just
      as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, '
    31: '³¹ and in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you,
      just as a man carries his son, on all of the road which you have walked until
      you came to this place.’ '
    32: '³² Yet in spite of all this, you did not trust the Lord your God, '
    33: "³³ who goes before you on your way, to seek out a place for you to make camp,\
      \ in the fire by night to show you the way by which you should go, and in the\
      \ cloud by day. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “Then the Lord heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and swore
      an oath, saying, '
    35: '³⁵ ‘Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which
      I swore to give your fathers, '
    36: '³⁶ except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him I will
      give the land on which he has set foot, and to his sons, because he has followed
      the Lord fully.’ '
    37: '³⁷ The Lord was angry with me also on your account, saying, ‘Not even you
      shall enter there. '
    38: '³⁸ Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall himself enter there;
      encourage him, for he will give it to Israel as an inheritance. '
    39: '³⁹ Moreover, your little ones who, you said, would become plunder, and your
      sons, who this day have no knowledge of good and evil, shall enter there, and
      I will give it to them and they shall take possession of it. '
    40: "⁴⁰ But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way\
      \ of the Red Sea.’ \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “Then you replied to me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord; we ourselves
      will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.’ And every man
      of you strapped on his weapons of war, and you viewed it as easy to go up into
      the hill country. '
    42: '⁴² But the Lord said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I
      am not among you; otherwise you will be defeated by your enemies.”’ '
    43: '⁴³ So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead, you rebelled against
      the command of the Lord, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill
      country. '
    44: '⁴⁴ And the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and
      chased you as bees do, and they scattered you from Seir to Hormah. '
    45: '⁴⁵ Then you returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord did not listen
      to your voice, nor pay attention to you. '
    46: ⁴⁶ So you remained at Kadesh for many days, the days that you spent there.
  2:
    1: '¹ “Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea,
      as the Lord spoke to me, and we circled Mount Seir for many days. '
    2: '² And the Lord spoke to me, saying, '
    3: '³ ‘You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn north, '
    4: '⁴ and command the people, saying, “You are going to pass through the territory
      of your brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid
      of you. So be very careful; '
    5: '⁵ do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even
      as much as a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. '
    6: '⁶ You are to buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall
      also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink. '
    7: "⁷ For the Lord your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has\
      \ known your wandering through this great wilderness. These forty years the\
      \ Lord your God has been with you; you have not lacked anything.”’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away
      from the Arabah road, away from Elath and Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed
      through by the way of the wilderness of Moab. '
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord said to me, ‘Do not attack Moab, nor provoke them to war,
      for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given
      Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ (The Emim lived there previously, a people as great, numerous, and tall
      as the Anakim. '
    11: '¹¹ Like the Anakim, they too are regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call
      them Emim. '
    12: '¹² The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed
      them and destroyed them from before them, and settled in their place; just as
      Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave them.) '
    13: '¹³ ‘Now arise and cross over the Wadi Zered yourselves.’ So we crossed over
      the Wadi Zered. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed
      over the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the
      men of war perished from within the camp, just as the Lord had sworn to them. '
    15: "¹⁵ Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from within\
      \ the camp until they all perished. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “So it came about, when all the men of war had finally perished from among
      the people, '
    17: '¹⁷ that the Lord spoke to me, saying, '
    18: '¹⁸ ‘Today you shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab. '
    19: '¹⁹ When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not attack them nor provoke
      them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession,
      because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.’ '
    20: '²⁰ (It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, because the Rephaim previously
      lived in it, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin, '
    21: '²¹ a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim; but the Lord destroyed
      them before them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place, '
    22: '²² just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed
      the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
      where they remain even to this day. '
    23: '²³ And as for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim,
      who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) '
    24: '²⁴ ‘Arise, set out, and pass through the Valley of Arnon. Look! I have handed
      over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; start taking possession
      and plunge into battle with him. '
    25: "²⁵ This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the faces\
      \ of people everywhere, who, when they hear the news of you, will tremble and\
      \ be in anguish because of you.’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of
      Heshbon with words of peace, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ ‘Let me pass through your land; I will travel only on the road. I will
      not turn aside to the right or to the left. '
    28: '²⁸ You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for
      money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot, '
    29: '²⁹ just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in
      Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land that the Lord our
      God is giving us.’ '
    30: '³⁰ But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land;
      for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order
      to hand him over to you, as he is today. '
    31: "³¹ And the Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to turn Sihon and his land\
      \ over to you. Begin taking possession, so that you may possess his land.’ \n"
    32: '³² “Then Sihon came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Jahaz. '
    33: '³³ And the Lord our God turned him over to us, and we defeated him with his
      sons and all his people. '
    34: '³⁴ So we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men,
      women, and children of every city. We left no survivor. '
    35: '³⁵ We took only the animals as our plunder, and the spoils of the cities
      which we had captured. '
    36: '³⁶ From Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of Arnon and from the city
      which is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high
      for us; the Lord our God turned it all over to us. '
    37: ³⁷ Only you did not go near the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river
      Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the Lord our God had
      commanded us to avoid.
  3:
    1: '¹ “Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan,
      came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Edrei. '
    2: '² But the Lord said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have handed him and all
      his people and his land over to you; and you shall do to him just as you did
      to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.’ '
    3: '³ So the Lord our God also handed over to us Og, king of Bashan, with all
      his people, and we struck them until no survivor was left. '
    4: '⁴ We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did
      not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og
      in Bashan. '
    5: '⁵ All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides
      a great many unwalled towns. '
    6: '⁶ We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying
      the men, women, and children of every city. '
    7: "⁷ But all the animals and the spoils of the cities we took as our plunder.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “So at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the
      Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon '
    9: '⁹ (Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir): '
    10: '¹⁰ all the cities of the plateau, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salecah
      and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. '
    11: "¹¹ (For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold,\
      \ his bed was a bed of iron; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. Its length\
      \ was nine cubits, and its width four cubits by the usual cubit.) \n"
    12: '¹² “So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is
      by the Valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I
      gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. '
    13: '¹³ The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe
      of Manasseh, all the region of Argob. (As to all Bashan, it is called the land
      of Rephaim. '
    14: '¹⁴ Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border
      of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, that is, Bashan, and named it after his
      own name: Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.) '
    15: '¹⁵ To Machir I gave Gilead. '
    16: '¹⁶ To the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead even as far as the
      Valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border, and as far as the river
      Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon; '
    17: "¹⁷ the Arabah also, with the Jordan as a border, from Chinnereth even as\
      \ far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah\
      \ on the east. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Then I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The Lord your God has given
      you this land to possess it; all you valiant men shall cross over armed ahead
      of your brothers, the sons of Israel. '
    19: '¹⁹ However, your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that
      you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you, '
    20: '²⁰ until the Lord gives rest to your fellow countrymen as to you, and they
      also take possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them beyond
      the Jordan. Then you may return, each man to his possession which I have given
      you.’ '
    21: '²¹ And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen everything
      that the Lord your God has done to these two kings; the Lord will do the same
      to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross. '
    22: "²² Do not fear them, for the Lord your God is the One fighting for you.’\
      \ \n"
    23: '²³ “I also pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ ‘Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your
      strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works
      and mighty acts as Yours? '
    25: '²⁵ Please let me cross over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan,
      that good hill country, and Lebanon.’ '
    26: '²⁶ But the Lord was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to
      me; instead, the Lord said to me, ‘Enough! Do not speak to Me any more about
      this matter. '
    27: '²⁷ Go up to the top of Pisgah and raise your eyes to the west, the north,
      the south, and the east, and see it with your eyes; for you shall not cross
      over this Jordan. '
    28: '²⁸ But commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall
      go across leading this people, and he will give to them, as an inheritance,
      the land which you will see.’ '
    29: ²⁹ So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
  4:
    1: '¹ “Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching
      you to perform, so that you will live and go in and take possession of the land
      which the Lord, the God of your fathers, is giving you. '
    2: '² You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from
      it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I am commanding
      you. '
    3: '³ Your eyes have seen what the Lord has done in the case of Baal-peor, for
      all the men who followed Baal-peor, the Lord your God has destroyed them from
      among you. '
    4: "⁴ But you who clung to the Lord your God are alive today, every one of you.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ “See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the Lord my God commanded
      me, that you are to do these things in the land where you are entering to take
      possession of it. '
    6: '⁶ So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the
      sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this
      great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ '
    7: '⁷ For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the Lord
      our God whenever we call on Him? '
    8: "⁸ Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous\
      \ as this whole Law which I am setting before you today? \n"
    9: '⁹ “Only be careful for yourself and watch over your soul diligently, so that
      you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart
      from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons
      and your grandsons. '
    10: '¹⁰ Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when the
      Lord said to me, ‘Assemble the people to Me, that I may have them hear My words
      so that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live on the earth,
      and that they may teach their children.’ '
    11: '¹¹ You came forward and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain
      was burning with fire to the heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud, and thick
      gloom. '
    12: '¹² Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound
      of words, but you saw no form—there was only a voice. '
    13: '¹³ So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform,
      that is, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. '
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments,\
      \ so that you would perform them in the land where you are going over to take\
      \ possession of it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “So be very careful yourselves, since you did not see any form on the
      day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire, '
    16: '¹⁶ so that you do not act corruptly and make a carved image for yourselves
      in the form of any figure, a representation of male or female, '
    17: '¹⁷ a representation of any animal that is on the earth, a representation
      of any winged bird that flies in the sky, '
    18: '¹⁸ a representation of anything that crawls on the ground, or a representation
      of any fish that is in the water below the earth. '
    19: '¹⁹ And be careful not to raise your eyes to heaven and look at the sun, the
      moon, and the stars, all the heavenly lights, and allow yourself to be drawn
      away and worship them and serve them, things which the Lord your God has allotted
      to all the peoples under the whole heaven. '
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from\
      \ Egypt, to be a people of His own possession, as today. \n"
    21: '²¹ “Now the Lord was angry with me on your account, and He swore that I would
      not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the Lord
      your God is giving you as an inheritance. '
    22: '²² For I am going to die in this land; I am not crossing the Jordan, but
      you are going to cross, and you will take possession of this good land. '
    23: '²³ So be careful yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the Lord
      your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the
      form of anything against which the Lord your God has commanded you. '
    24: "²⁴ For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “When you father children and have grandchildren, and you grow old in
      the land, and you act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and
      do what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God to provoke Him to anger, '
    26: '²⁶ I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that you will
      certainly perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to
      take possession of it. You will not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed. '
    27: '²⁷ The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few
      in number among the nations where the Lord drives you. '
    28: '²⁸ There you will serve gods, the work of human hands, wood and stone, which
      neither see nor hear, nor eat nor smell anything. '
    29: '²⁹ But from there you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find Him
      if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul. '
    30: '³⁰ When you are in distress and all these things happen to you, in the latter
      days you will return to the Lord your God and listen to His voice. '
    31: "³¹ For the Lord your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you\
      \ nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore\
      \ to them. \n"
    32: '³² “Indeed, ask now about the earlier days that were before your time, since
      the day that God created mankind on the earth, and inquire from one end of the
      heavens to the other. Has anything been done like this great thing, or has anything
      been heard like it? '
    33: '³³ Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire,
      as you have heard it, and survived? '
    34: '³⁴ Or has a god ventured to go to take for himself a nation from within another
      nation by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched
      arm, and by great terrors, just as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before
      your eyes? '
    35: '³⁵ You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord, He is
      God; there is no other besides Him. '
    36: '³⁶ Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on
      earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst
      of the fire. '
    37: '³⁷ Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them.
      And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power, '
    38: '³⁸ driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to
      bring you in and to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is today. '
    39: '³⁹ Therefore know today, and take it to your heart, that the Lord, He is
      God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other. '
    40: "⁴⁰ So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving\
      \ you today, so that it may go well for you and for your children after you,\
      \ and that you may live long on the land which the Lord your God is giving you\
      \ for all time.” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east, '
    42: '⁴² for one to flee there who unintentionally killed his neighbor, without
      having hatred for him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he
      might live: '
    43: "⁴³ Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead\
      \ for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Now this is the Law which Moses set before the sons of Israel; '
    45: '⁴⁵ these are the testimonies and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses
      spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt, '
    46: '⁴⁶ across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon
      king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel
      defeated when they came out of Egypt. '
    47: '⁴⁷ And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan,
      the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan to the east, '
    48: '⁴⁸ from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of Arnon, even as far as
      Mount Sion (that is, Hermon), '
    49: ⁴⁹ with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea
      of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.
  5:
    1: "¹ Now Moses summoned all Israel and said to them:\n“Listen, Israel, to the\
      \ statutes and ordinances which I am speaking today for you to hear, so that\
      \ you may learn them and be careful to do them. "
    2: '² The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. '
    3: '³ The Lord did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all of
      us who are alive here today. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the
      fire, '
    5: "⁵ while I was standing between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to\
      \ you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire, and you\
      \ did not go up on the mountain. He said, \n"
    6: "⁶ ‘I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of\
      \ the house of slavery. \n"
    7: "⁷ ‘You shall have no other gods besides Me. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of what
      is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. '
    9: '⁹ You shall not worship them nor serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am
      a jealous God, inflicting the punishment of the fathers on the children, even
      on the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, '
    10: "¹⁰ but showing favor to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ ‘You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord\
      \ will not leave unpunished the one who takes His name in vain. \n"
    12: '¹² ‘Keep the Sabbath day to treat it as holy, as the Lord your God commanded
      you. '
    13: '¹³ For six days you shall labor and do all your work, '
    14: '¹⁴ but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God; you shall not do
      any work that day, you or your son or your daughter, or your male slave or your
      female slave, or your ox, your donkey, or any of your cattle, or your resident
      who stays with you, so that your male slave and your female slave may rest as
      well as you. '
    15: "¹⁵ And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and\
      \ the Lord your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and an outstretched\
      \ arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to celebrate the Sabbath day.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ ‘Honor your father and your mother, just as the Lord your God has commanded\
      \ you, so that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well for you on\
      \ the land which the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘You shall not murder. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ ‘You shall not commit adultery. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ ‘You shall not steal. \n"
    20: "²⁰ ‘You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. \n"
    21: "²¹ ‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor desire your neighbor’s\
      \ house, his field, his male slave or his female slave, his ox, his donkey,\
      \ or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’ \n"
    22: '²² “These words the Lord spoke to your whole assembly at the mountain from
      the midst of the fire, from the cloud, and from the thick darkness, with a great
      voice, and He added nothing more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone and
      gave them to me. '
    23: '²³ And when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the
      mountain was burning with fire, you approached me, all the heads of your tribes
      and your elders. '
    24: '²⁴ You said, ‘Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness,
      and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that
      God speaks with mankind, yet he lives. '
    25: '²⁵ Now then, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we
      hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, then we will die! '
    26: '²⁶ For who is there of humanity who has heard the voice of the living God
      speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? '
    27: "²⁷ Go near and listen to everything that the Lord our God says; then speak\
      \ to us everything that the Lord our God speaks to you, and we will listen and\
      \ do it.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “Now the Lord heard the sound of your words when you spoke to me, and
      the Lord said to me, ‘I have heard the sound of the words of this people which
      they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken. '
    29: '²⁹ If only they had such a heart in them, to fear Me and keep all My commandments
      always, so that it would go well with them and with their sons forever! '
    30: '³⁰ Go, say to them, “Return to your tents.” '
    31: '³¹ But as for you, stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments,
      the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, so that they may
      follow them in the land which I am giving them to possess.’ '
    32: '³² So you shall be careful to do just as the Lord your God has commanded
      you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left. '
    33: ³³ You shall walk entirely in the way which the Lord your God has commanded
      you, so that you may live and that it may be well for you, and that you may
      prolong your days in the land which you will possess.
  6:
    1: '¹ “Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments which the
      Lord your God has commanded me to teach you, so that you may do them in the
      land where you are going over to take possession of it, '
    2: '² so that you, your son, and your grandson will fear the Lord your God, to
      keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days
      of your life, and that your days may be prolonged. '
    3: "³ Now Israel, you shall listen and be careful to do them, so that it may go\
      \ well for you and that you may increase greatly, just as the Lord, the God\
      \ of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ “Hear, Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one! '
    5: '⁵ And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
      soul and with all your strength. '
    6: '⁶ These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. '
    7: '⁷ And you shall repeat them diligently to your sons and speak of them when
      you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when
      you get up. '
    8: '⁸ You shall also tie them as a sign to your hand, and they shall be as frontlets
      on your forehead. '
    9: "⁹ You shall also write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Then it shall come about when the Lord your God brings you into the land
      that He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you, great
      and splendid cities which you did not build, '
    11: '¹¹ and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and carved
      cisterns which you did not carve out, vineyards and olive trees which you did
      not plant, and you eat and are satisfied, '
    12: '¹² be careful that you do not forget the Lord who brought you out of the
      land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. '
    13: '¹³ You shall fear only the Lord your God; and you shall worship Him and swear
      by His name. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround
      you, '
    15: "¹⁵ for the Lord your God who is in the midst of you is a jealous God; so\
      \ follow Him, or else the anger of the Lord your God will be kindled against\
      \ you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “You shall not put the Lord your God to the test, as you tested Him at
      Massah. '
    17: '¹⁷ You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and His
      provisions and His statutes which He has commanded you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, so that
      it may go well for you and that you may go in and take possession of the good
      land which the Lord swore to give your fathers, '
    19: "¹⁹ by driving out all your enemies from you, as the Lord has spoken. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What do the provisions
      and the statutes and the judgments mean which the Lord our God commanded you?’ '
    21: '²¹ then you shall say to your son, ‘We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and
      the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. '
    22: '²² Moreover, the Lord provided great and terrible signs and wonders before
      our eyes against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household; '
    23: '²³ He brought us out of there in order to bring us in, to give us the land
      which He had sworn to our fathers.’ '
    24: '²⁴ So the Lord commanded us to follow all these statutes, to fear the Lord
      our God for our own good always and for our survival, as it is today. '
    25: ²⁵ And it will be righteousness for us if we are careful to follow all this
      commandment before the Lord our God, just as He commanded us.
  7:
    1: '¹ “When the Lord your God brings you into the land where you are entering
      to take possession of it, and He drives away many nations from before you, the
      Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the
      Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you, '
    2: '² and when the Lord your God turns them over to you and you defeat them, you
      shall utterly destroy them. You shall not make a covenant with them nor be gracious
      to them. '
    3: '³ Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your
      daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons. '
    4: '⁴ For they will turn your sons away from following Me, and they will serve
      other gods; then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and He will
      quickly destroy you. '
    5: '⁵ But this is what you shall do to them: you shall tear down their altars,
      smash their memorial stones, cut their Asherim to pieces, and burn their carved
      images in the fire. '
    6: "⁶ For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen\
      \ you to be a people for His personal possession out of all the peoples who\
      \ are on the face of the earth. \n"
    7: '⁷ “The Lord did not make you His beloved nor choose you because you were greater
      in number than any of the peoples, since you were the fewest of all peoples, '
    8: '⁸ but because the Lord loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your
      forefathers, the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from
      the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ Know therefore that the Lord your God, He is God, the faithful God, who
      keeps His covenant and His faithfulness to a thousand generations for those
      who love Him and keep His commandments; '
    10: '¹⁰ but He repays those who hate Him to their faces, to eliminate them; He
      will not hesitate toward him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face. '
    11: "¹¹ Therefore, you shall keep the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments\
      \ which I am commanding you today, to do them. \n"
    12: '¹² “Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep
      and do them, that the Lord your God will keep His covenant with you and His
      faithfulness which He swore to your forefathers. '
    13: '¹³ And He will love you, bless you, and make you numerous; He will also bless
      the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain, your new wine,
      and your oil, the newborn of your cattle and the offspring of your flock, in
      the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall be blessed above all peoples; there will be no sterile male
      or infertile female among you or among your cattle. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the Lord will remove from you all sickness; and He will not inflict
      upon you any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known, but He will
      give them to all who hate you. '
    16: "¹⁶ You shall consume all the peoples whom the Lord your God will turn over\
      \ to you; your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for\
      \ that would be a snare to you. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “If you say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I; how can
      I dispossess them?’ '
    18: '¹⁸ you are not to be afraid of them; you shall remember well what the Lord
      your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: '
    19: '¹⁹ the great trials which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders, and
      the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought
      you out. The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples of whom you are
      afraid. '
    20: '²⁰ Indeed, the Lord your God will send the hornet against them, until those
      who are left and hide themselves from you perish. '
    21: '²¹ You are not to be terrified of them, because the Lord your God is in your
      midst, a great and awesome God. '
    22: '²² And the Lord your God will drive away these nations from you little by
      little; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly, otherwise the wild
      animals would become too numerous for you. '
    23: '²³ But the Lord your God will turn them over to you, and will throw them
      into great confusion until they are destroyed. '
    24: '²⁴ And He will hand over their kings to you, so that you will eliminate their
      name from under heaven; no one will be able to stand against you until you have
      destroyed them. '
    25: '²⁵ The carved images of their gods you are to burn with fire; you shall not
      covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, or
      you will be trapped by it; for it is an abomination to the Lord your God. '
    26: ²⁶ And you shall not bring an abomination into your house and become designated
      for destruction, like it; you are to utterly detest it, and you are to utterly
      loathe it, for it is something designated for destruction.
  8:
    1: '¹ “All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful
      to do, so that you may live and increase, and go in and take possession of the
      land which the Lord swore to give to your forefathers. '
    2: '² And you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you in
      the wilderness these forty years, in order to humble you, putting you to the
      test, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments
      or not. '
    3: '³ And He humbled you and let you go hungry, and fed you with the manna which
      you did not know, nor did your fathers know, in order to make you understand
      that man shall not live on bread alone, but man shall live on everything that
      comes out of the mouth of the Lord. '
    4: '⁴ Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty
      years. '
    5: '⁵ So you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God was disciplining
      you just as a man disciplines his son. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk
      in His ways and to fear Him. '
    7: '⁷ For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of streams
      of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in valleys and hills; '
    8: '⁸ a land of wheat and barley, of vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, a land
      of olive oil and honey; '
    9: '⁹ a land where you will eat food without shortage, in which you will not lack
      anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. '
    10: "¹⁰ When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the Lord your God\
      \ for the good land which He has given you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God by failing to keep
      His commandments, His ordinances, and His statutes which I am commanding you
      today; '
    12: '¹² otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, and you build good houses and
      live in them, '
    13: '¹³ and when your herds and your flocks increase, and your silver and gold
      increase, and everything that you have increases, '
    14: '¹⁴ then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God
      who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; '
    15: '¹⁵ He who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery
      serpents and scorpions, and its thirsty ground where there was no water; He
      who brought water for you out of the rock of flint. '
    16: '¹⁶ In the wilderness it was He who fed you manna which your fathers did not
      know, in order to humble you and in order to put you to the test, to do good
      for you in the end. '
    17: '¹⁷ Otherwise, you may say in your heart, ‘My power and the strength of my
      hand made me this wealth.’ '
    18: '¹⁸ But you are to remember the Lord your God, for it is He who is giving
      you power to make wealth, in order to confirm His covenant which He swore to
      your fathers, as it is this day. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it shall come about, if you ever forget the Lord your God and follow
      other gods and serve and worship them, I testify against you today that you
      will certainly perish. '
    20: ²⁰ Like the nations that the Lord eliminates from you, so you shall perish,
      because you would not listen to the voice of the Lord your God.
  9:
    1: '¹ “Hear, Israel! You are crossing the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess
      nations greater and mightier than you, cities that are great and fortified to
      heaven, '
    2: '² a people who are great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know and
      of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand against the sons of Anak?’ '
    3: "³ So be aware today that it is the Lord your God who is crossing over ahead\
      \ of you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and He will subdue them before\
      \ you, so that you may drive them out and eliminate them quickly, just as the\
      \ Lord has spoken to you. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Do not say in your heart when the Lord your God has driven them away from
      you, ‘Because of my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to take possession
      of this land.’ Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that
      the Lord is dispossessing them before you. '
    5: "⁵ It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart\
      \ that you are going in to take possession of their land, but it is because\
      \ of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord your God is driving them\
      \ out from before you, and in order to confirm the oath which the Lord swore\
      \ to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Know, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord
      your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people. '
    7: '⁷ Remember, do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the
      wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at
      this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ Even at Horeb you provoked the Lord to anger, and the Lord was so angry
      with you that He would have destroyed you. '
    9: '⁹ When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets
      of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I remained on the mountain
      for forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. '
    10: '¹⁰ The Lord gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God;
      and on them were all the words which the Lord had spoken with you at the mountain
      from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. '
    11: '¹¹ It came about at the end of forty days and nights that the Lord gave me
      the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. '
    12: '¹² Then the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, go down from here quickly, because your
      people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have behaved corruptly. They have quickly
      turned aside from the way that I commanded them; they have made a cast metal
      image for themselves.’ '
    13: '¹³ The Lord also said to me, ‘I have seen this people, and indeed, it is
      a stubborn people. '
    14: "¹⁴ Leave Me alone, that I may destroy them and wipe out their name from under\
      \ heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning
      with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the Lord your God. You had
      made for yourselves a cast metal image of a calf; you had quickly turned aside
      from the way that the Lord had commanded you. '
    17: '¹⁷ So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my two hands, and
      smashed them to pieces before your eyes! '
    18: '¹⁸ Then I fell down before the Lord like the first time, for forty days and
      nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you
      had committed by doing what was evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him
      to anger. '
    19: '¹⁹ For I was afraid of the anger and the rage with which the Lord was angry
      with you so as to destroy you; but the Lord listened to me that time as well. '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord was also angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I also prayed
      for Aaron at the same time. '
    21: "²¹ And I took your sinful thing which you had made, the calf, and burned\
      \ it in the fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was as fine\
      \ as dust; and I threw its dust into the stream that came down from the mountain.\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² “Then at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah you kept provoking
      the Lord to anger. '
    23: '²³ And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, ‘Go up and take
      possession of the land which I have given you,’ you rebelled against the command
      of the Lord your God; you neither trusted Him nor listened to His voice. '
    24: "²⁴ You have been rebellious toward the Lord since the day I knew you. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “So I fell down before the Lord for the forty days and nights, which I
      did because the Lord said He would destroy you. '
    26: '²⁶ And I prayed to the Lord and said, ‘Lord God, do not destroy Your people,
      Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have
      brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand! '
    27: '²⁷ Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not turn Your attention
      to the stubbornness of this people, or to their wickedness, or their sin. '
    28: '²⁸ Otherwise, the people of the land from which You brought us will say,
      “Since the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which He had promised
      them, and since He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness!” '
    29: ²⁹ Yet they are Your people, and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by
      Your great power and Your outstretched arm.’
  10:
    1: '¹ “At that time the Lord said to me, ‘Cut out for yourself two tablets of
      stone like the first two, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark
      of wood for yourself. '
    2: '² Then I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets
      which you smashed to pieces, and you shall put them in the ark.’ '
    3: '³ So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the
      first two, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. '
    4: '⁴ Then He wrote on the tablets, like the first writing, the Ten Commandments
      which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire
      on the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me. '
    5: "⁵ Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and I put the tablets in\
      \ the ark which I had made; and they are there, just as the Lord commanded me.”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ (Now the sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There
      Aaron died and there he was buried, and his son Eleazar served as priest in
      his place. '
    7: '⁷ From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land
      of streams of water. '
    8: '⁸ At that time the Lord singled out the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of
      the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to serve Him and to bless
      in His name, until this day. '
    9: "⁹ Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers;\
      \ the Lord is his inheritance, just as the Lord your God spoke to him.) \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “I, moreover, stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights like
      the first time, and the Lord listened to me that time also; the Lord was not
      willing to destroy you. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, proceed on your journey ahead of the\
      \ people, so that they may go in and take possession of the land which I swore\
      \ to their fathers to give them.’ \n"
    12: '¹² “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear
      the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the Lord
      your God with all your heart and with all your soul, '
    13: '¹³ and to keep the Lord’s commandments and His statutes which I am commanding
      you today for your good? '
    14: '¹⁴ Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the
      earth and all that is in it. '
    15: '¹⁵ Yet the Lord set His affection on your fathers, to love them, and He chose
      their descendants after them, you over all the other peoples, as it is this
      day. '
    16: '¹⁶ So circumcise your heart, and do not stiffen your neck any longer. '
    17: '¹⁷ For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great,
      the mighty, and the awesome God, who does not show partiality, nor take a bribe. '
    18: '¹⁸ He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for
      the stranger by giving him food and clothing. '
    19: '¹⁹ So show your love for the stranger, for you were strangers in the land
      of Egypt. '
    20: '²⁰ You shall fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him, and cling to Him,
      and you shall swear by His name. '
    21: '²¹ He is your glory and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome
      things for you which your eyes have seen. '
    22: ²² Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now the Lord
      your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.
  11:
    1: '¹ “You shall therefore love the Lord your God, and always keep His directive,
      His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments. '
    2: '² Know this day that I am not speaking with your sons who have not known and
      who have not seen the discipline of the Lord your God—His greatness, His mighty
      hand, His outstretched arm, '
    3: '³ and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh
      the king of Egypt and to all his land; '
    4: '⁴ and what He did to Egypt’s army, to its horses and its chariots, when He
      made the water of the Red Sea engulf them while they were pursuing you, and
      the Lord completely eliminated them; '
    5: '⁵ and what He did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; '
    6: '⁶ and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben,
      when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their
      tents, and every living thing that followed them, among all Israel— '
    7: "⁷ but your own eyes have seen all the great work of the Lord which He did.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “You shall therefore keep every commandment which I am commanding you today,
      so that you may be strong and go in and take possession of the land into which
      you are about to cross to possess it; '
    9: '⁹ and so that you may prolong your days on the land which the Lord swore to
      your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk
      and honey. '
    10: '¹⁰ For the land, into which you are entering to possess it, is not like the
      land of Egypt from which you came, where you used to sow your seed and water
      it by your foot like a vegetable garden. '
    11: '¹¹ But the land into which you are about to cross to possess it, a land of
      hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven, '
    12: "¹² a land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God\

    13: '¹³ “And it shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments
      which I am commanding you today, to love the Lord your God and to serve Him
      with all your heart and all your soul, '
    14: '¹⁴ that He will provide rain for your land in its season, the early and late
      rain, so that you may gather your grain, your new wine, and your oil. '
    15: '¹⁵ He will also provide grass in your field for your cattle, and you will
      eat and be satisfied. '
    16: '¹⁶ Beware that your hearts are not easily deceived, and that you do not turn
      away and serve other gods, and worship them. '
    17: "¹⁷ Otherwise, the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and He will\
      \ shut up the sky so that there will be no rain, and the ground will not yield\
      \ its produce; then you will quickly perish from the good land which the Lord\
      \ is giving you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “You shall therefore take these words of mine to heart and to soul; and
      you shall tie them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets on
      your forehead. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall also teach them to your sons, speaking of them when you sit
      in your house, when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you
      get up. '
    20: '²⁰ And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, '
    21: '²¹ so that your days and the days of your sons may be increased on the land
      which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are
      above the earth. '
    22: '²² For if you are careful to keep all of this commandment which I am commanding
      you to do, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and cling to Him, '
    23: '²³ then the Lord will dispossess all these nations from you, and you will
      dispossess nations greater and mightier than you. '
    24: '²⁴ Every place on which the sole of your foot steps shall be yours; your
      border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river
      Euphrates, as far as the western sea. '
    25: "²⁵ No one will be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will instill\
      \ the dread of you and the fear of you in all the land on which you set foot,\
      \ just as He has spoken to you. \n"
    26: '²⁶ “See, I am placing before you today a blessing and a curse: '
    27: '²⁷ the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the Lord your God,
      which I am commanding you today; '
    28: "²⁸ and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the Lord your\
      \ God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following\
      \ other gods which you have not known. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “And it shall come about, when the Lord your God brings you into the land
      where you are entering to possess it, that you shall place the blessing on Mount
      Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. '
    30: '³⁰ Are they not across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in
      the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the

  12:
    1: '¹ “These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall carefully follow
      in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess
      as long as you live on the earth. '
    2: '² You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you are
      going to dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains, on the hills, and
      under every leafy tree. '
    3: '³ And you shall tear down their altars and smash their memorial stones to
      pieces, and burn their Asherim in the fire, and cut to pieces the carved images
      of their gods; and you shall eliminate their name from that place. '
    4: '⁴ You shall not act this way toward the Lord your God. '
    5: '⁵ But you shall seek the Lord at the place which the Lord your God will choose
      from all your tribes, to establish His name there for His dwelling, and you
      shall come there. '

    8: '⁸ “You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever
      is right in his own eyes; '

      the Lord your God is giving you. '
    10: '¹⁰ When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the Lord your God
      is giving you as an inheritance, and He gives you rest from all your enemies
      around you so that you live in security, '
    11: '¹¹ then it shall come about that the place in which the Lord your God will

      Lord. '
    12: "¹² And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you and your sons and\

    14: "¹⁴ but only in the place which the Lord chooses in one of your tribes: there\
      \ you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do everything that\

    15: '¹⁵ “However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, whatever
      you desire, according to the blessing of the Lord your God which He has given
      you; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as the gazelle and the deer. '
    16: '¹⁶ Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground
      like water. '
    17: '¹⁷ You are not allowed to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,
      new wine, or oil, or the firstborn of your herd or flock, or any of your vowed
      offerings which you vow, or your voluntary offerings, or the contribution of
      your hand. '
    18: '¹⁸ But you shall eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the

      whatever you desire. '
    22: '²² Just as a gazelle or a deer is eaten, so you may eat it; the unclean and
      the clean alike may eat it. '
    23: '²³ Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you
      shall not eat the life with the flesh. '
    24: '²⁴ You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water. '
    25: '²⁵ You shall not eat it, so that it may go well for you and your sons after
      you, since you will be doing what is right in the sight of the Lord. '
    26: '²⁶ Only your holy things which you may have and your vowed offerings, you
      shall take and go to the place which the Lord chooses. '
    27: "²⁷ And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on\
      \ the altar of the Lord your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be\

    31: "³¹ You shall not behave this way toward the Lord your God, because every\

      eat and be satisfied, in order that the Lord your God may bless you in all the
      work of your hand which you do.
  15:
    1: '¹ “At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release of debts. '
    2: '² And this is the regulation for the release of debts: every creditor is to
      forgive what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not require it of his neighbor
      and his brother, because the Lord’s release has been proclaimed. '
    3: '³ From a foreigner you may require it, but your hand shall forgive whatever
      of yours is with your brother. '
    4: '⁴ However, there will be no poor among you, since the Lord will certainly
      bless you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance
      to possess, '
    5: '⁵ if only you listen obediently to the voice of the Lord your God, to follow
      carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today. '
    6: "⁶ For the Lord your God will have blessed you just as He has promised you,\
      \ and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule\
      \ over many nations, but they will not rule over you. \n"
    7: '⁷ “If there is a poor person among you, one of your brothers, in any of your
      towns in your land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden
      your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother; '
    8: '⁸ but you shall fully open your hand to him, and generously lend him enough
      for his need in whatever he lacks. '
    9: '⁹ Be careful that there is no mean-spirited thought in your heart, such as,
      ‘The seventh year, the year of release of debts, is near,’ and your eye is malicious
      toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry out to the
      Lord against you, and it will be a sin in you. '
    10: '¹⁰ You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grudging
      when you give to him, because for this thing the Lord your God will bless you
      in all your work, and in all your undertakings. '
    11: "¹¹ For the poor will not cease to exist in the land; therefore I am commanding\
      \ you, saying, ‘You shall fully open your hand to your brother, to your needy\
      \ and poor in your land.’ \n"
    12: '¹² “If your fellow countryman, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, then
      he shall serve you for six years, but in the seventh year you shall set him
      free. '
    13: '¹³ And when you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed. '
    14: '¹⁴ You shall give generously to him from your flock, your threshing floor,
      and from your wine vat; you shall give to him as the Lord your God has blessed
      you. '
    15: '¹⁵ And you are to remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and
      the Lord your God redeemed you; therefore I am commanding this of you today. '
    16: '¹⁶ But it shall come about, if he says to you, ‘I will not leave you,’ because
      he loves you and your household, since he is doing well with you, '
    17: "¹⁷ then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door,\
      \ and he shall be your servant permanently. You shall also do the same to your\
      \ female slave. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “It shall not seem difficult for you when you set him free, because he\
      \ has given you six years with double the service of a hired worker; so the\
      \ Lord your God will bless you in whatever you do. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “You shall consecrate to the Lord your God all the firstborn males that
      are born in your herd and in your flock; you shall not work with the firstborn
      of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. '
    20: '²⁰ You and your household shall eat it every year before the Lord your God
      in the place which the Lord chooses. '
    21: '²¹ But if it has any impairment, such as a limp, or blindness, or any serious
      impairment, you shall not sacrifice it to the Lord your God. '
    22: '²² You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike may
      eat it, as a gazelle or a deer. '
    23: ²³ Only you shall not eat its blood; you are to pour it out on the ground
      like water.
  16:
    1: '¹ “Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God,
      for in the month of Abib the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night. '
    2: '² You shall sacrifice the Passover to the Lord your God from the flock and
      the herd, in the place where the Lord chooses to establish His name. '
    3: '³ You shall not eat leavened bread with it; for seven days you shall eat unleavened
      bread with it, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt
      in a hurry), so that you will remember the day when you came out of the land
      of Egypt all the days of your life. '
    4: '⁴ For seven days no leaven shall be seen with you in your entire territory,
      and none of the meat which you sacrifice on the evening of the first day shall
      be left overnight until the morning. '
    5: '⁵ You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover in any of your towns which
      the Lord your God is giving you; '
    6: '⁶ but only at the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish His name,
      you shall sacrifice the Passover in the evening at sunset, at the time that
      you came out of Egypt. '
    7: '⁷ You shall cook and eat it in the place which the Lord your God chooses.
      In the morning you are to return to your tents. '
    8: "⁸ For six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there\
      \ shall be a festive assembly to the Lord your God; you shall do no work on\
      \ it. \n"
    9: '⁹ “You shall count seven weeks for yourself; you shall begin to count seven
      weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God with
      a voluntary offering of your hand in a proportional amount, which you shall
      give just as the Lord your God blesses you; '
    11: '¹¹ and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you, your son and your
      daughter, and your male and female slaves, and the Levite who is in your town,
      and the stranger, the orphan, and the widow who are in your midst, at the place
      where the Lord your God chooses to establish His name. '
    12: "¹² You shall also remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall\
      \ be careful and comply with these statutes. \n"
    13: '¹³ “You shall celebrate the Feast of Booths for seven days when you have
      gathered in from your threshing floor and your wine vat; '
    14: '¹⁴ and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son and your daughter,
      and your male and female slaves, and the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and
      the widow who are in your towns. '
    15: "¹⁵ For seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the Lord your God in the\
      \ place which the Lord chooses, because the Lord your God will bless you in\
      \ all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you will be altogether\
      \ joyful. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God
      at the place which He chooses: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast
      of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths; and they are not to appear before the
      Lord empty-handed. '
    17: "¹⁷ Everyone shall give as he is able, in accordance with the blessing of\
      \ the Lord your God which He has given you. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “You shall appoint for yourself judges and officers in all your towns
      which the Lord your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall
      judge the people with righteous judgment. '
    19: '¹⁹ You shall not distort justice, you shall not show partiality; and you
      shall not accept a bribe, because a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and distorts
      the words of the righteous. '
    20: "²⁰ Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, so that you may live and\
      \ possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you. \n"
    21: '²¹ “You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind of tree beside
      the altar of the Lord your God, which you shall make for yourself. '
    22: ²² And you shall not set up for yourself a memorial stone, which the Lord
      your God hates.
  17:
    1: "¹ “You shall not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep which has\
      \ a blemish or any defect, for that is a detestable thing to the Lord your God.\
      \ \n"
    2: '² “If there is found in your midst, in any of your towns which the Lord your
      God is giving you, a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the
      Lord your God, by violating His covenant, '
    3: '³ and that person has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the
      sun, the moon, or any of the heavenly lights, which I have commanded not to
      do, '
    4: '⁴ and if it is reported to you and you have heard about it, then you shall
      investigate thoroughly. And if it is true and the report is trustworthy that
      this detestable thing has been done in Israel, '
    5: '⁵ then you are to bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this
      evil deed, that is, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them to death. '
    6: '⁶ On the testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses, the condemned shall
      be put to death; he shall not be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. '
    7: "⁷ The hands of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death,\
      \ and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall eliminate the evil\
      \ from your midst. \n"
    8: '⁸ “If a case is too difficult for you to decide, between one kind of homicide
      or another, between one kind of lawsuit or another, and between one kind of
      assault or another, that are cases of dispute in your courts, then you shall
      arise and go up to the place which the Lord your God chooses. '
    9: '⁹ So you shall come to the Levitical priests or the judge who is in office
      in those days, and you shall inquire of them and they will declare to you the
      verdict. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then you shall act in accordance with the terms of the verdict which they
      declare to you from that place which the Lord chooses; and you shall be careful
      to act in accordance with everything that they instruct you to do. '
    11: '¹¹ In accordance with the terms of the law about which they instruct you,
      and in accordance with the verdict which they tell you, you shall act; you shall
      not turn aside from the word which they declare to you, to the right or the
      left. '
    12: '¹² But the person who acts insolently by not listening to the priest who
      stands there to serve the Lord your God, nor to the judge, that person shall
      die; so you shall eliminate the evil from Israel. '
    13: "¹³ Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act insolently\
      \ again. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “When you enter the land which the Lord your God is giving you, and you
      take possession of it and live in it, and you say, ‘I will appoint a king over
      me like all the nations who are around me,’ '
    15: '¹⁵ you shall in fact appoint a king over you whom the Lord your God chooses.
      One from among your countrymen you shall appoint as king over yourselves; you
      may not put a foreigner over yourselves, anyone who is not your countryman. '
    16: '¹⁶ In any case, he is not to acquire many horses for himself, nor shall he
      make the people return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the Lord
      has said to you, ‘You shall never again return that way.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ And he shall not acquire many wives for himself, so that his heart does\
      \ not turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Now it shall come about, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that
      he shall write for himself a copy of this Law on a scroll in the presence of
      the Levitical priests. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life,
      so that he will learn to fear the Lord his God, by carefully following all the
      words of this Law and these statutes, '
    20: ²⁰ so that his heart will not be haughty toward his countrymen, and that he
      will not turn away from the commandment to the right or the left, so that he
      and his sons may live long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel.
  18:
    1: '¹ “The Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall not have a portion
      or inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the Lord’s offerings by fire and
      His property. '
    2: "² They shall not have an inheritance among their countrymen; the Lord is their\
      \ inheritance, as He promised them. \n"
    3: '³ “Now this shall be the priests’ portion from the people, from those who
      offer a sacrifice, either an ox or a sheep: they shall give the priest the shoulder,
      the two cheeks, and the stomach. '
    4: '⁴ You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, your new wine, and your
      oil, and the first fleece of your sheep. '
    5: "⁵ For the Lord your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes,\
      \ to stand to serve in the name of the Lord always. \n"
    6: '⁶ “Now if a Levite comes from any of your towns throughout Israel where he
      resides, and he comes whenever he desires to the place which the Lord chooses, '
    7: '⁷ then he shall serve in the name of the Lord his God, like all his fellow
      Levites who stand there before the Lord. '
    8: "⁸ They shall eat equal portions, except for what they receive from the sale\
      \ of their fathers’ estates. \n"
    9: '⁹ “When you enter the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall
      not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations. '
    10: '¹⁰ There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter
      pass through the fire, one who uses divination, a soothsayer, one who interprets
      omens, or a sorcerer, '
    11: '¹¹ or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who consults
      the dead. '
    12: '¹² For whoever does these things is detestable to the Lord; and because of
      these detestable things the Lord your God is going to drive them out before
      you. '
    13: '¹³ You are to be blameless before the Lord your God. '
    14: "¹⁴ For these nations, which you are going to dispossess, listen to soothsayers\
      \ and diviners, but as for you, the Lord your God has not allowed you to do\
      \ so. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among
      you, from your countrymen; to him you shall listen. '
    16: '¹⁶ This is in accordance with everything that you asked of the Lord your
      God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying, ‘Do not let me hear the voice
      of the Lord my God again, and do not let me see this great fire anymore, or
      I will die!’ '
    17: '¹⁷ And the Lord said to me, ‘They have spoken well. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will raise up for them a prophet from among their countrymen like you,
      and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them everything
      that I command him. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it shall come about that whoever does not listen to My words which
      he speaks in My name, I Myself will require it of him. '
    20: '²⁰ But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name, a word which
      I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods,
      that prophet shall die.’ '
    21: '²¹ And if you say in your heart, ‘How will we recognize the word which the
      Lord has not spoken?’ '
    22: ²² When the prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, and the thing does not
      happen or come true, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken. The prophet
      has spoken it presumptuously; you are not to be afraid of him.
  19:
    1: '¹ “When the Lord your God cuts off the nations whose land the Lord your God
      is giving you, and you dispossess them and settle in their cities and in their
      houses, '
    2: '² you shall set aside for yourself three cities in the midst of your land
      which the Lord your God is giving you to possess. '
    3: "³ You shall prepare the roads for yourself, and divide into three regions\
      \ the territory of your land which the Lord your God will give you as an inheritance,\
      \ so that anyone who commits manslaughter may flee there. \n"
    4: '⁴ “Now this is the case of the one who commits manslaughter, who may flee
      there and live: when he kills his friend unintentionally, not hating him previously— '
    5: '⁵ as when a person goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood, and his
      hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron head slips off the handle
      and strikes his friend so that he dies—he may flee to one of these cities and
      live. '
    6: '⁶ Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in the heat of his anger,
      and overtake him because the way is long, and take his life, though he was not
      sentenced to death since he had not hated him previously. '
    7: "⁷ Therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall set aside for yourself three\
      \ cities.’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “And if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, just as He has sworn
      to your fathers, and gives you all the land that He promised to give your fathers— '
    9: '⁹ if you carefully follow all of this commandment which I am commanding you
      today, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in His ways always—then you shall
      add three more cities for yourself, besides these three. '
    10: "¹⁰ So innocent blood will not be shed in the midst of your land which the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and guilt for bloodshed will\
      \ not be on you. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “But if there is a person who hates his neighbor, and waits in ambush
      for him and rises up against him and strikes him so that he dies, and he flees
      to one of these cities, '
    12: '¹² then the elders of his city shall send men and take him from there, and
      hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die. '
    13: "¹³ You shall not pity him, but you shall eliminate the guilt for the bloodshed\
      \ of the innocent from Israel, so that it may go well for you. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “You shall not displace your neighbor’s boundary marker, which the ancestors\
      \ have set, in your inheritance which you will inherit in the land that the\
      \ Lord your God is giving you to possess. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “A single witness shall not rise up against a person regarding any wrongdoing
      or any sin that he commits; on the testimony of two or three witnesses a matter
      shall be confirmed. '
    16: '¹⁶ If a malicious witness rises up against a person to testify against him
      of wrongdoing, '
    17: '¹⁷ then both people who have the dispute shall stand before the Lord, before
      the priests and the judges who will be in office in those days. '
    18: '¹⁸ And the judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is a false
      witness and he has testified against his brother falsely, '
    19: '¹⁹ then you shall do to him just as he had planned to do to his brother.
      So you shall eliminate the evil from among you. '
    20: '²⁰ And the rest of the people will hear and be afraid, and will never again
      do such an evil thing among you. '
    21: '²¹ So you shall not show pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
      hand for hand, and foot for foot.'
  20:
    1: '¹ “When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses, chariots,
      and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the Lord your
      God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you. '
    2: '² When you are approaching the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak
      to the people. '
    3: '³ He shall say to them, ‘Hear, Israel, you are approaching the battle against
      your enemies today. Do not be fainthearted. Do not be afraid, or panic, or be
      terrified by them, '
    4: '⁴ for the Lord your God is the One who is going with you, to fight for you
      against your enemies, to save you.’ '
    5: '⁵ The officers also shall speak to the people, saying, ‘Who is the man that
      has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his
      house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would dedicate it. '
    6: '⁶ And who is the man that has planted a vineyard but has not put it to use?
      Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and
      another man would put it to use. '
    7: '⁷ And who is the man that is betrothed to a woman and has not married her?
      Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and
      another man would marry her.’ '
    8: '⁸ Then the officers shall speak further to the people and say, ‘Who is the
      man that is afraid and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, so
      that he does not make his brothers’ hearts melt like his heart!’ '
    9: "⁹ And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, they shall appoint\
      \ commanders of armies at the head of the people. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “When you approach a city to fight against it, you shall offer it terms
      of peace. '
    11: '¹¹ And if it agrees to make peace with you and opens to you, then all the
      people who are found in it shall become your forced labor and serve you. '
    12: '¹² However, if it does not make peace with you, but makes war against you,
      then you shall besiege it. '
    13: '¹³ When the Lord your God gives it into your hand, you shall strike all the
      men in it with the edge of the sword. '
    14: '¹⁴ However, the women, the children, the animals, and everything that is
      in the city, all of its spoils, you shall take as plunder for yourself; and
      you shall use the spoils of your enemies which the Lord your God has given you. '
    15: '¹⁵ This is what you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you,
      which are not of the cities of these nations nearby. '
    16: '¹⁶ Only in the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving you
      as an inheritance, you shall not leave anything that breathes alive. '
    17: '¹⁷ Instead, you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittite and the Amorite,
      the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the Lord
      your God has commanded you, '
    18: "¹⁸ so that they will not teach you to do all the same detestable practices\
      \ of theirs which they have done for their gods, by which you would sin against\
      \ the Lord your God. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “When you besiege a city for a long time, to make war against it in order
      to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by swinging an axe against them;
      for you may eat from them, so you shall not cut them down. For is the tree of
      the field a human, that it should be besieged by you? '
    20: ²⁰ Only the trees that you know are not fruit trees you shall destroy and
      cut down, so that you may construct siegeworks against the city that is making
      war against you until it falls.
  21:
    1: '¹ “If a person who has been killed by someone is found lying in the open country
      in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess, and it is not
      known who struck him, '

      the cities which are around the one who was killed. '
    3: '³ And it shall be that the city which is nearest to the person killed, that
      is, that the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd that has not
      been worked and has not pulled in a yoke; '
    4: '⁴ and the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with
      running water, which has not been plowed or sown, and they shall break the heifer’s
      neck there in the valley. '
    5: '⁵ Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, because the Lord
      your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of the Lord;
      and every dispute and violent crime shall be settled by them. '
    6: '⁶ And all the elders of that city which is nearest to the person killed shall
      wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; '
    7: '⁷ and they shall respond and say, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, nor

      shall offer on it burnt offerings to the Lord your God; '
    7: '⁷ and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and eat there, and rejoice before
      the Lord your God. '
    8: "⁸ You shall write on the stones all the words of this Law very clearly.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, “Be silent
      and listen, Israel! This day you have become a people for the Lord your God. '
    10: "¹⁰ So you shall obey the Lord your God, and do His commandments and His statutes\
      \ which I am commanding you today.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Moses also commanded the people on that day, saying, '
    12: '¹² “When you cross the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim
      to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. '
    13: '¹³ For the curse, these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher,
      Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. '
    14: "¹⁴ The Levites shall then respond and say to all the people of Israel with\
      \ a loud voice, \n"
    15: "¹⁵ ‘Cursed is the person who makes a carved image or cast metal image, an\

    1: '¹ “Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful

    12: '¹² The Lord will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens, to give rain

    30: '³⁰ You will betroth a woman, but another man will violate her; you will build

    35: '³⁵ The Lord will strike you on the knees and thighs with severe boils from
      which you cannot be healed, and strike you from the sole of your foot to the
      top of your head. '
    36: '³⁶ The Lord will bring you and your king, whom you appoint over you, to a

    40: '⁴⁰ You will have olive trees throughout your territory but you will not anoint
      yourself with the oil, because your olives will drop off prematurely. '
    41: '⁴¹ You will father sons and daughters but they will not remain yours, because
      they will go into captivity. '

    43: '⁴³ The stranger who is among you will rise above you higher and higher, and

    49: '⁴⁹ “The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end
      of the earth, as the eagle swoops down; a nation whose language you will not
      understand, '
    50: '⁵⁰ a nation with a defiant attitude, who will have no respect for the old,
      nor show favor to the young. '
    51: '⁵¹ Furthermore, it will eat the offspring of your herd and the produce of

      until they have eliminated you. '
    52: '⁵² And it will besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified

      you in all your towns throughout your land which the Lord your God has given
      you. '
    53: '⁵³ Then you will eat the offspring of your own body, the flesh of your sons
      and of your daughters whom the Lord your God has given you, during the siege
      and the hardship by which your enemy will oppress you. '
    54: '⁵⁴ The man who is refined and very delicate among you will be hostile toward
      his brother, toward the wife he cherishes, and toward the rest of his children
      who are left, '
    55: '⁵⁵ so that he will not give even one of them any of the flesh of his children
      which he will eat, since he has nothing else left, during the siege and the
      hardship by which your enemy will oppress you in all your towns. '
    56: '⁵⁶ The refined and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set
      the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and tenderness,
      will be hostile toward the husband she cherishes and toward her son and daughter, '
    57: "⁵⁷ and toward her afterbirth that comes from between her legs, and toward\
      \ her children to whom she gives birth, because she will eat them secretly for\
      \ lack of anything else, during the siege and the hardship with which your enemy\
      \ will oppress you in your towns. \n"
    58: '⁵⁸ “If you are not careful to follow all the words of this Law that are written
      in this book, to fear this honored and awesome name, the Lord your God, '
    59: '⁵⁹ then the Lord will bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants,
      severe and lasting plagues, and miserable and chronic sicknesses. '
    60: '⁶⁰ And He will bring back on you every disease of Egypt of which you were
      afraid, and they will cling to you. '
    61: '⁶¹ Also every sickness and every plague, which are not written in the book
      of this Law, the Lord will bring on you until you are destroyed. '
    62: '⁶² Then you will be left few in number, whereas you were as numerous as the
      stars of heaven, because you did not obey the Lord your God. '
    63: '⁶³ And it will come about that, just as the Lord rejoiced over you to be
      good to you, and make you numerous, so will the Lord rejoice over you to wipe
      you out and destroy you; and you will be torn away from the land which you are
      entering to possess. '
    64: '⁶⁴ Furthermore, the Lord will scatter you among all the peoples, from one
      end of the earth to the other; and there you will serve other gods, made of
      wood and stone, which you and your fathers have not known. '
    65: '⁶⁵ Among those nations you will find no peace, and there will be no resting
      place for the sole of your foot; but there the Lord will give you a trembling
      heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul. '
    66: '⁶⁶ So your lives will be hanging in doubt before you; and you will be terrified
      night and day, and have no assurance of your life. '
    67: '⁶⁷ In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ And at evening
      you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’ because of the terror of your heart
      which you fear, and the sight of your eyes which you will see. '
    68: ⁶⁸ And the Lord will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way about which
      I said to you, ‘You will never see it again!’ And there you will offer yourselves
      for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.”
  29:
    1: "¹ These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make\
      \ with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He\
      \ had made with them at Horeb. \n"
    2: '² And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “You have seen all that
      the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants,
      and to all his land; '
    3: '³ the great trials which your eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders. '
    4: '⁴ Yet to this day the Lord has not given you a heart to know, nor eyes to
      see, nor ears to hear. '
    5: '⁵ And I have led you in the wilderness for forty years; your clothes have
      not worn out on you, and your sandal has not worn out on your foot. '
    6: '⁶ You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or other strong drink,
      in order that you might know that I am the Lord your God. '
    7: '⁷ When you reached this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of
      Bashan came out to meet us for battle, but we defeated them; '
    8: '⁸ and we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites,
      the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites. '
    9: "⁹ So you will keep the words of this covenant and do them, in order that you\
      \ may be successful in everything that you do. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “You stand today, all of you, before the Lord your God: your heads, your
      tribes, your elders and your officers, that is, all the men of Israel, '
    11: '¹¹ your little ones, your wives, and the stranger who is within your camps,
      from the one who gathers your firewood to the one who draws your water, '
    12: '¹² so that you may enter into the covenant with the Lord your God, and into
      His oath which the Lord your God is making with you today, '
    13: "¹³ in order that He may establish you today as His people, and that He may\
      \ be your God, just as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham,\
      \ Isaac, and Jacob. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Now it is not with you alone that I am making this covenant and this
      oath, '
    15: '¹⁵ but both with those who stand here with us today in the presence of the
      Lord our God, and with those who are not with us here today '
    16: '¹⁶ (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we passed through
      the midst of the nations through which you passed; '
    17: '¹⁷ moreover, you have seen their abominations and their idols made of wood
      and stone, silver and gold, which they had with them); '
    18: '¹⁸ so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe,
      whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God, to go to serve the gods
      of those nations; that there will not be among you a root bearing poisonous
      fruit and wormwood. '
    19: '¹⁹ And it shall be when he hears the words of this curse, that he will consider
      himself fortunate in his heart, saying, ‘I will do well though I walk in the
      stubbornness of my heart in order to destroy the watered land along with the
      dry.’ '
    20: '²⁰ The Lord will not be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the
      Lord and His wrath will burn against that person, and every curse that is written
      in this book will lie upon him, and the Lord will wipe out his name from under
      heaven. '
    21: "²¹ Then the Lord will single him out for disaster from all the tribes of\
      \ Israel, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant which is written\
      \ in this Book of the Law. \n"
    22: '²² “Now the future generation, your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner
      who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of that land and the
      diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it, will say, '
    23: '²³ ‘All its land is brimstone and salt, burned debris, unsown and unproductive,
      and no grass grows on it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and
      Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.’ '
    24: '²⁴ All the nations will say, ‘Why has the Lord done all this to this land?
      Why this great outburst of anger?’ '
    25: '²⁵ Then people will say, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the
      Lord, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them
      out of the land of Egypt. '
    26: '²⁶ And they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they
      have not known and whom He had not assigned to them. '
    27: '²⁷ Therefore, the anger of the Lord burned against that land, to bring upon
      it every curse which is written in this book; '
    28: "²⁸ and the Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, fury, and in great\
      \ wrath, and hurled them into another land, as it is this day.’ \n"
    29: ²⁹ “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed
      belong to us and to our sons forever, so that we may follow all the words of
      this Law.
  30:
    1: '¹ “So it will be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing
      and the curse which I have placed before you, and you call them to mind in all
      the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you, '

      soul in accordance with everything that I am commanding you today, you and your
      sons, '
    3: '³ then the Lord your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion
      on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the Lord your God
      has scattered you. '
    4: '⁴ If any of your scattered countrymen are at the ends of the earth, from there

      soul, so that you may live. '
    7: '⁷ And the Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and
      on those who hate you, who persecuted you. '
    8: '⁸ And you will again obey the Lord, and follow all His commandments which
      I am commanding you today. '
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord your God will prosper you abundantly in every work of your
      hand, in the children of your womb, the offspring of your cattle, and in the
      produce of your ground, for the Lord will again rejoice over you for good, just
      as He rejoiced over your fathers; '
    10: "¹⁰ if you obey the Lord your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes\
      \ which are written in this Book of the Law, if you turn to the Lord your God\
      \ with all your heart and soul. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “For this commandment which I am commanding you today is not too difficult
      for you, nor is it far away. '
    12: '¹² It is not in heaven, that you could say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for
      us and get it for us, and proclaim it to us, so that we may follow it?’ '
    13: '¹³ Nor is it beyond the sea, that you could say, ‘Who will cross the sea
      for us and get it for us and proclaim it to us, so that we may follow it?’ '
    14: "¹⁴ On the contrary, the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your\
      \ heart, that you may follow it. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “See, I have placed before you today life and happiness, and death and
      adversity, '
    16: '¹⁶ in that I am commanding you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in
      His ways and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, so that
      you may live and become numerous, and that the Lord your God may bless you in
      the land where you are entering to take possession of it. '
    17: '¹⁷ But if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but allow yourself
      to be led astray and you worship other gods and serve them, '
    18: '¹⁸ I declare to you today that you will certainly perish. You will not prolong
      your days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and take possession
      of it. '
    19: '¹⁹ I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have placed
      before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order
      that you may live, you and your descendants, '
    20: ²⁰ by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding close
      to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, so that you may live
      in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
      to give them.”
  31:
    1: '¹ So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. '
    2: '² And he said to them, “I am 120 years old today; I am no longer able to go
      out and come in, and the Lord has told me, ‘You shall not cross this Jordan.’ '
    3: '³ It is the Lord your God who is going to cross ahead of you; He Himself will
      destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the
      one who is going to cross ahead of you, just as the Lord has spoken. '
    4: '⁴ And the Lord will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of
      the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them. '
    5: '⁵ The Lord will turn them over to you, and you will do to them in accordance
      with all the commandments which I have commanded you. '
    6: "⁶ Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or in dread of them, for the\
      \ Lord your God is the One who is going with you. He will not desert you or\
      \ abandon you.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel,
      “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land which
      the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you will give it to them
      as an inheritance. '
    8: "⁸ And the Lord is the one who is going ahead of you; He will be with you.\
      \ He will not desert you or abandon you. Do not fear and do not be dismayed.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ So Moses wrote this Law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who
      carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, at
      the time of the year of the release of debts, at the Feast of Booths, '
    11: '¹¹ when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place
      which He will choose, you shall read this Law before all Israel so that they
      hear it. '
    12: '¹² Assemble the people, the men, the women, the children, and the stranger
      who is in your town, so that they may hear and learn and fear the Lord your
      God, and be careful to follow all the words of this Law. '
    13: "¹³ And their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to fear the\
      \ Lord your God, as long as you live on the land which you are about to cross\
      \ the Jordan to possess.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, the time for you to die is near;
      call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, and I will commission
      him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting. '
    15: '¹⁵ And the Lord appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar
      of cloud stood at the entrance of the tent. '
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord said to Moses, “Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers;
      and this people will arise and play the prostitute with the foreign gods of
      the land into the midst of which they are going, and they will abandon Me and
      break My covenant which I have made with them. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then My anger will be kindled against them on that day, and I will abandon
      them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and
      troubles will find them; so they will say on that day, ‘Is it not because our
      God is not among us that these evils have found us?’ '
    18: "¹⁸ But I will assuredly hide My face on that day because of all the evil\
      \ that they will have done, for they will have turned away to other gods. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Now then, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of
      Israel; put it on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for Me against
      the sons of Israel. '
    20: '²⁰ For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which
      I swore to their fathers, and they eat and are satisfied and become prosperous,
      then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My
      covenant. '
    21: '²¹ Then it will come about, when many evils and troubles find them, that
      this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten
      from the mouth of their descendants); for I know their inclination which they
      are developing today, before I bring them into the land which I swore.” '
    22: "²² So Moses wrote down this song on the same day, and taught it to the sons\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    23: "²³ Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous,\
      \ for you will bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them,\
      \ and I will be with you.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ It came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this Law in a
      book until they were complete, '
    25: '²⁵ that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of
      the Lord, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you. '
    27: '²⁷ For I know your rebellion and your stubbornness; behold, as long as I
      have been alive with you until today, you have been rebellious against the Lord;
      how much more, then, after my death? '
    28: '²⁸ Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I
      may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth as
      witnesses against them. '
    29: "²⁹ For I know that after my death you will behave very corruptly and turn\
      \ from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will confront you in the\
      \ latter days, because you will do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord,\
      \ provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands.” \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words
      of this song, until they were complete:'
  32:
    1: "¹ “Listen, you heavens, and I will speak;\nAnd let the earth hear the words\
      \ of my mouth!\n"
    2: "² May my teaching drip as the rain,\nMy speech trickle as the dew,\nAs droplets\
      \ on the fresh grass,\nAnd as the showers on the vegetation.\n"
    3: "³ For I proclaim the name of the Lord;\nAscribe greatness to our God!\n"
    4: "⁴ The Rock! His work is perfect,\nFor all His ways are just;\nA God of faithfulness\
      \ and without injustice,\nRighteous and just is He.\n"
    5: "⁵ They have acted corruptly against Him,\nThey are not His children, because\
      \ of their defect;\nBut are a perverse and crooked generation.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is this what you do to the Lord,\nYou foolish and unwise people?\nIs He\
      \ not your Father who has purchased you?\nHe has made you and established you.\n"
    7: "⁷ Remember the days of old,\nConsider the years of all generations.\nAsk your\
      \ father and he will inform you,\nYour elders, and they will tell you.\n"
    8: "⁸ When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,\nWhen He separated\
      \ the sons of mankind,\nHe set the boundaries of the peoples\nAccording to the\
      \ number of the sons of Israel.\n"
    9: "⁹ For the Lord’s portion is His people;\nJacob is the allotment of His inheritance.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He found him in a desert land,\nAnd in the howling wasteland of a wilderness;\n\
      He encircled him, He cared for him,\nHe guarded him as the apple of His eye.\n"
    11: "¹¹ As an eagle stirs up its nest,\nAnd hovers over its young,\nHe spread\
      \ His wings, He caught them,\nHe carried them on His pinions.\n"
    12: "¹² The Lord alone guided him,\nAnd there was no foreign god with him.\n"
    13: "¹³ He had him ride on the high places of the earth,\nAnd he ate the produce\
      \ of the field;\nAnd He had him suck honey from the rock,\nAnd oil from the\
      \ flinty rock,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Curds of the herd, and milk of the flock,\nWith fat of lambs\nAnd rams,\
      \ the breed of Bashan, and of goats,\nWith the best of the wheat;\nAnd you drank\
      \ wine of the blood of grapes. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “But Jeshurun became fat and kicked—\nYou have become fat, thick, and\
      \ obstinate—\nThen he abandoned God who made him,\nAnd rejected the Rock of\
      \ his salvation.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They made Him jealous with strange gods;\nWith abominations they provoked\
      \ Him to anger.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They sacrificed to demons, who were not God,\nTo gods whom they have not\
      \ known,\nNew gods who came lately,\nWhom your fathers did not know.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ You forgot the Rock who fathered you,\nAnd forgot the God who gave you\
      \ birth. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “The Lord saw this, and spurned them\nBecause of the provocation by His\
      \ sons and daughters.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Then He said, ‘I will hide My face from them,\nI will see what their end\
      \ will be;\nFor they are a perverse generation,\nSons in whom there is no faithfulness.\n"
    21: "²¹ They have made Me jealous with what is not God;\nThey have provoked Me\
      \ to anger with their idols.\nSo I will make them jealous with those who are\
      \ not a people;\nI will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation,\n"
    22: "²² For a fire has flared in My anger,\nAnd it burns to the lowest part of\
      \ Sheol,\nAnd devours the earth with its yield,\nAnd sets on fire the foundations\
      \ of the mountains. \n"
    23: "²³ ‘I will add misfortunes to them;\nI will use up My arrows on them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ They will be wasted by famine, and emaciated by plague\nAnd a bitter epidemic;\n\
      And the teeth of beasts I will send against them,\nWith the venom of crawling\
      \ things of the dust.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Outside the sword will make them childless,\nAnd inside, terror—\nBoth\
      \ young man and virgin,\nThe nursing child with the man of gray hair.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I would have said, “I will wipe them out,\nI will remove the mention of\
      \ their name from humanity,”\n"
    27: "²⁷ Had I not feared the provocation by the enemy,\nThat their adversaries\
      \ would misjudge,\nThat they would say, “Our hand is triumphant,\nAnd the Lord\
      \ has not performed all this.”’ \n"
    28: "²⁸ “For they are a nation destitute of counsel,\nAnd there is no understanding\
      \ in them.\n"
    29: "²⁹ If only they were wise and they understood this;\nIf only they would discern\
      \ their future!\n"
    30: "³⁰ How could one chase a thousand,\nAnd two put ten thousand to flight,\n\
      Unless their Rock had sold them,\nAnd the Lord had given them up?\n"
    31: "³¹ Indeed, their rock is not like our Rock;\nEven our enemies themselves\
      \ judge this.\n"
    32: "³² For their vine is from the vine of Sodom,\nAnd from the fields of Gomorrah;\n\
      Their grapes are grapes of poison,\nTheir clusters, bitter.\n"
    33: "³³ Their wine is the venom of serpents,\nAnd the deadly poison of vipers.\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ ‘Is it not stored up with Me,\nSealed up in My treasuries?\n"
    35: "³⁵ Vengeance is Mine, and retribution;\nIn due time their foot will slip.\n\
      For the day of their disaster is near,\nAnd the impending things are hurrying\
      \ to them.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ For the Lord will vindicate His people,\nAnd will have compassion on His\
      \ servants,\nWhen He sees that their strength is gone,\nAnd there is none remaining,\
      \ bond or free.\n"
    37: "³⁷ And He will say, ‘Where are their gods,\nThe rock in which they took refuge?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Those who ate the fat of their sacrifices,\nAnd drank the wine of their\
      \ drink offering?\nLet them rise up and help you,\nLet them be your protection!\n"
    39: "³⁹ See now that I, I am He,\nAnd there is no god besides Me;\nIt is I who\
      \ put to death and give life.\nI have wounded and it is I who heal,\nAnd there\
      \ is no one who can save anyone from My hand.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Indeed, I raise My hand to heaven,\nAnd say, as I live forever,\n"
    41: "⁴¹ If I have sharpened My flashing sword,\nAnd My hand has taken hold of\
      \ justice,\nI will return vengeance on My adversaries,\nAnd I will repay those\
      \ who hate Me.\n"
    42: "⁴² I will make My arrows drunk with blood,\nAnd My sword will devour flesh,\n\
      With the blood of the slain and the captives,\nFrom the long-haired leaders\
      \ of the enemy.’\n"
    43: "⁴³ Rejoice, you nations, with His people;\nFor He will avenge the blood of\
      \ His servants,\nAnd will return vengeance on His adversaries,\nAnd will atone\
      \ for His land and His people.” \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of
      the people, he, with Joshua the son of Nun. '
    45: '⁴⁵ When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, '
    46: '⁴⁶ he said to them, “Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning
      you today, which you will command your sons to follow carefully, all the words
      of this Law. '
    47: "⁴⁷ For it is not a trivial matter for you; indeed it is your life. And by\
      \ this word you will prolong your days in the land, which you are about to cross\
      \ the Jordan to possess.” \n"
    48: '⁴⁸ Now the Lord spoke to Moses that very same day, saying, '
    49: '⁴⁹ “Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land
      of Moab opposite Jericho, and look at the land of Canaan, which I am giving
      to the sons of Israel as a possession. '
    50: '⁵⁰ Then you are to die on the mountain where you ascend, and be gathered
      to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to
      his people, '
    51: '⁵¹ because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at
      the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not
      treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel. '
    52: ⁵² For you will see the land at a distance but you will not go there, into
      the land which I am giving the sons of Israel.”
  33:
    1: '¹ Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons
      of Israel before his death. '
    2: "² He said,\n“The Lord came from Sinai,\nAnd dawned on them from Seir;\nHe\
      \ shone from Mount Paran,\nAnd He came from the midst of myriads of holy ones;\n\
      At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them.\n"
    3: "³ Indeed, He loves the people;\nAll Your holy ones are in Your hand,\nAnd\
      \ they followed in Your steps;\nEveryone takes of Your words.\n"
    4: "⁴ Moses issued to us the Law,\nA possession for the assembly of Jacob.\n"
    5: "⁵ And He was king in Jeshurun,\nWhen the heads of the people gathered,\nThe\
      \ tribes of Israel together. \n"
    6: "⁶ “May Reuben live and not die,\nNor may his people be few.” \n"
    7: "⁷ And this was regarding Judah; so he said:\n“Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah,\n\
      And bring him to his people.\nWith his hands he contended for them,\nAnd may\
      \ You be a help against his adversaries.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Of Levi he said,\n“Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to Your godly man,\n\
      Whom You tested at Massah,\nWith whom You contended at the waters of Meribah;\n"
    9: "⁹ Who said of his father and his mother,\n‘I did not consider them’;\nAnd\
      \ he did not acknowledge his brothers,\nNor did he regard his own sons,\nFor\
      \ they kept Your word,\nAnd complied with Your covenant.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They will teach Your ordinances to Jacob,\nAnd Your Law to Israel.\nThey\
      \ shall put incense before You,\nAnd whole burnt offerings on Your altar.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Lord, bless his strength,\nAnd accept the work of his hands;\nSmash the\
      \ hips of those who rise up against him,\nAnd those who hate him, so that they\
      \ do not rise again.” \n"
    12: "¹² Of Benjamin he said,\n“May the beloved of the Lord live in security beside\
      \ Him\nWho shields him all the day long,\nAnd he lives between His shoulders.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Of Joseph he said,\n“Blessed of the Lord be his land,\nWith the choice\
      \ things of heaven, with the dew,\nAnd from the deep waters lying beneath,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And with the choice yield of the sun,\nAnd the choice produce of the months;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And with the best things of the ancient mountains,\nWith the choice things\
      \ of the everlasting hills,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ And with the choice things of the earth and its fullness,\nAnd the favor\
      \ of Him who dwelt in the bush.\nLet it come to the head of Joseph,\nAnd to\
      \ the top of the head of the one who was prince among his brothers.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ As the firstborn of his ox, majesty is his,\nAnd his horns are the horns\
      \ of the wild ox;\nWith them he will gore the peoples\nAll at once, to the ends\
      \ of the earth.\nAnd those are the ten thousands of Ephraim,\nAnd those are\
      \ the thousands of Manasseh.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Of Zebulun he said,\n“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out,\nAnd, Issachar,\
      \ in your tents.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They will call peoples to the mountain;\nThere they will offer righteous\
      \ sacrifices;\nFor they will draw out the abundance of the seas,\nAnd the hidden\
      \ treasures of the sand.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Of Gad he said,\n“Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad;\nHe lies down as\
      \ a lion,\nAnd tears the arm, also the crown of the head.\n"
    21: "²¹ Then he selected the choicest part for himself,\nFor there the ruler’s\
      \ portion was reserved;\nAnd he came with the leaders of the people;\nHe executed\
      \ the justice of the Lord,\nAnd His ordinances with Israel.” \n"
    22: "²² Of Dan he said,\n“Dan is a lion’s cub;\nHe leaps out from Bashan.” \n"
    23: "²³ Of Naphtali he said,\n“Naphtali, satisfied with favor,\nAnd full of the\
      \ blessing of the Lord,\nTake possession of the sea and the south.” \n"
    24: "²⁴ Of Asher he said,\n“More blessed than sons is Asher;\nMay he be favored\
      \ by his brothers,\nAnd may he dip his foot in olive oil.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your bars will be iron and bronze,\nAnd as your days, so will your strength\
      \ be. \n"
    26: "²⁶ “There is no one like the God of Jeshurun,\nWho rides the heavens to your\
      \ help,\nAnd the clouds in His majesty.\n"
    27: "²⁷ The eternal God is a hiding place,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting\
      \ arms;\nAnd He drove out the enemy from you,\nAnd said, ‘Destroy!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ So Israel lives in security,\nThe fountain of Jacob secluded,\nIn a land\
      \ of grain and new wine;\nHis heavens also drip down dew.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Blessed are you, Israel;\nWho is like you, a people saved by the Lord,\n\
      The shield of your help,\nAnd He who is the sword of your majesty!\nSo your\
      \ enemies will cringe before you,\nAnd you will trample on their high places.”"
  34:
    1: '¹ Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
      which is opposite Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead as far
      as Dan, '
    2: '² and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land
      of Judah as far as the western sea, '
    3: '³ and the Negev and the territory in the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm
      trees, as far as Zoar. '
    4: '⁴ Then the Lord said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac,
      and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’; I have let you see
      it with your eyes, but you will not go over there.” '
    5: '⁵ So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, in accordance
      with the word of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor;
      but no one knows his burial place to this day. '
    7: '⁷ Although Moses was 120 years old when he died, his eyesight was not dim,
      nor had his vigor left him. '
    8: "⁸ So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days;\
      \ then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because
      Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and
      did as the Lord had commanded Moses. '
    10: '¹⁰ Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord
      knew face to face, '
    11: '¹¹ for all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to perform in the
      land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land— '
    12: ¹² and for all the mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed
      in the sight of all Israel.
