Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon\
      \ our beloved brother and fellow worker, "
    2: '² and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the
      church in your house: '
    3: "³ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: '⁴ I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, '
    5: '⁵ because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord
      Jesus and toward all the saints; '
    6: '⁶ and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through
      the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for the sake of Christ. '
    7: "⁷ For I have had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of\
      \ the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do
      what is proper, '
    9: "⁹ yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you—since I am such a person as Paul,\
      \ an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I fathered in my imprisonment, '
    11: '¹¹ who previously was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to
      me. '
    12: '¹² I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart, '
    13: '¹³ whom I wanted to keep with me, so that in your behalf he might be at my
      service in my imprisonment for the gospel; '
    14: '¹⁴ but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness
      would not be, in effect, by compulsion, but of your own free will. '
    15: '¹⁵ For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for
      a while, that you would have him back forever, '
    16: "¹⁶ no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially\
      \ to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ If then you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that
      to my account; '
    19: '¹⁹ I, Paul, have written this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention
      to you that you owe to me even your own self as well). '
    20: "²⁰ Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in\
      \ Christ. \n"
    21: "²¹ Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that\
      \ you will do even more than what I say. \n"
    22: "²² At the same time also prepare me a guest room, for I hope that through\
      \ your prayers I will be given to you. \n"
    23: '²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, '
    24: "²⁴ as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
