2 Samuel:
  1:
    1: '¹ Now it came about after the death of Saul, when David had returned from
      the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David stayed two days in Ziklag. '
    2: '² And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul’s camp with his clothes
      torn and dust on his head. And it happened when he came to David, he fell to
      the ground and prostrated himself. '
    3: '³ Then David said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I
      have escaped from the camp of Israel.” '
    4: '⁴ David said to him, “How did things go? Please tell me.” And he said, “The
      people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and
      are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” '
    5: '⁵ Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul
      and his son Jonathan are dead?” '
    6: '⁶ The young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,
      and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the
      horsemen had overtaken him. '
    7: '⁷ When he looked behind himself, he saw me, and called to me. And I said,
      ‘Here I am.’ '
    8: '⁸ Then he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ And I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ '
    9: '⁹ And he said to me, ‘Please stand next to me and finish me off, for agony
      has seized me because my life still lingers in me.’ '
    10: "¹⁰ So I stood next to him and finished him off, because I knew that he could\
      \ not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which was on his head and\
      \ the band which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so also did all
      the men who were with him. '
    12: '¹² And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son
      Jonathan, and for the people of the Lord and the house of Israel, because they
      had fallen by the sword. '
    13: '¹³ Then David said to the young man who informed him, “Where are you from?”
      And he answered, “I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.” '
    14: '¹⁴ And David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to reach out with
      your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then David called one of the young men and said, “Come forward, put him
      to death.” So he struck him and he died. '
    16: "¹⁶ And David said to him, “Your blood is on your head, because your own mouth\
      \ has testified against you, saying, ‘I have finished off the Lord’s anointed.’”\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then David sang this song of mourning over Saul and his son Jonathan, '
    18: "¹⁸ and he told them to teach the sons of Judah the mourning song of the bow;\
      \ behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Your beauty, Israel, is slaughtered on your high places!\nHow the mighty\
      \ have fallen!\n"
    20: "²⁰ Tell it not in Gath,\nProclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,\nOr\
      \ the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,\nThe daughters of the uncircumcised\
      \ will celebrate.\n"
    21: "²¹ Mountains of Gilboa,\nMay there be no dew nor rain on you, or fields of\
      \ offerings!\nFor there the shield of the mighty was defiled,\nThe shield of\
      \ Saul, not anointed with oil.\n"
    22: "²² From the blood of those slaughtered, from the fat of the mighty,\nThe\
      \ bow of Jonathan did not turn back,\nAnd the sword of Saul did not return unstained.\n"
    23: "²³ Saul and Jonathan, beloved and delightful in life,\nAnd in their deaths\
      \ they were not separated;\nThey were swifter than eagles,\nThey were mightier\
      \ than lions.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\nWho clothed you in scarlet, with\
      \ jewelry,\nWho put gold jewelry on your apparel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle!\nJonathan is slaughtered\
      \ on your high places.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;\nYou have been a close friend\
      \ to me.\nYour love for me was more wonderful\nThan the love of women.\n"
    27: "²⁷ How the mighty have fallen,\nAnd the weapons of war have perished!”"
  2:
    1: '¹ Then it came about afterward that David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall
      I go up to one of the cities of Judah?” And the Lord said to him, “Go up.” So
      David said, “Where shall I go up?” And He said, “To Hebron.” '
    2: '² So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess
      and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. '
    3: '³ And David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household;
      and they settled in the cities of Hebron. '
    4: "⁴ Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the\
      \ house of Judah.\nAnd they told David, saying, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead\
      \ who buried Saul.” "
    5: '⁵ So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them,
      “May you be blessed of the Lord because you have shown this kindness to Saul
      your lord, and have buried him. '
    6: '⁶ And now may the Lord show kindness and truth to you; and I also will show
      this goodness to you, because you have done this thing. '
    7: "⁷ Now then, let your hands be strong and be valiant, since Saul your lord\
      \ is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.” \n"
    8: '⁸ But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth
      the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. '
    9: '⁹ And he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over
      Ephraim, and over Benjamin, even over all Israel. '
    10: '¹⁰ Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over
      Israel, and he was king for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed
      David. '
    11: "¹¹ And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was\
      \ seven years and six months. \n"
    12: '¹² Now Abner the son of Ner, went from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants
      of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul. '
    13: '¹³ And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met
      them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, Abner’s men on the one side of
      the pool and Joab’s men on the other side of the pool. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Abner said to Joab, “Now have the young men arise and hold a martial
      skills match in our presence.” And Joab said, “Have them arise!” '
    15: '¹⁵ So they got up and went over by count, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth
      the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. '
    16: '¹⁶ And each one of them seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword
      in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was
      called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. '
    17: "¹⁷ That day the battle was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were\
      \ defeated by the servants of David. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel; and
      Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles that is in the field. '
    19: '¹⁹ Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from
      following Abner. '
    20: '²⁰ Then Abner looked behind himself and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” And
      he said, “It is I!” '
    21: '²¹ So Abner said to him, “Turn aside for your own good to your right or to
      your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for
      yourself his equipment.” But Asahel was unwilling to turn aside from following
      him. '
    22: '²² Then Abner repeated again to Asahel, “Turn aside for your own good from
      following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I show my
      face to your brother Joab?” '
    23: "²³ However, he refused to turn aside; so Abner struck him in the belly with\
      \ the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he\
      \ fell there and died on the spot. And it happened that all who came thereafter\
      \ to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still. \n"
    24: '²⁴ But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and when the sun was going down, they
      came to the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah by way of the wilderness of
      Gibeon. '
    25: '²⁵ And the sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one
      troop, and they stood on the top of a hill. '
    26: '²⁶ Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Should the sword devour forever?
      Do you not realize that it will be bitter in the end? So how long will you refrain
      from telling the people to turn back from pursuing their kinsmen?” '
    27: '²⁷ Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, then the people of Judah
      certainly would have withdrawn in the morning, each from pursuing his brother.” '
    28: '²⁸ So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people halted and no longer pursued
      Israel, nor did they continue to fight anymore. '
    29: "²⁹ Abner and his men then went through the Arabah all that night; so they\
      \ crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner; but he gathered all the people
      together, and nineteen of David’s servants were missing, besides Asahel. '
    31: '³¹ However, the servants of David had struck and killed many of Benjamin
      and Abner’s men; 360 men were dead. '
    32: ³² And they carried Asahel away and buried him in his father’s tomb, which
      was in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night until the day dawned
      at Hebron.
  3:
    1: "¹ Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David;\
      \ and David became steadily stronger, while the house of Saul became steadily\
      \ weaker. \n"
    2: '² Sons were born to David in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the
      Jezreelitess; '
    3: '³ and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and
      the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; '
    4: '⁴ and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the
      son of Abital; '
    5: "⁵ and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These sons were born to David\
      \ in Hebron. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now it happened that while there was war between the house of Saul and the
      house of David, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul. '
    7: '⁷ And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and
      Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?” '
    8: '⁸ Then Abner became very angry over Ish-bosheth’s question and said, “Am I
      a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul
      your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not let you fall into
      the hands of David; yet today you call me to account for wrongdoing with that
      woman? '
    9: '⁹ May God do so to me, and more so, if as the Lord has sworn to David, I do
      not accomplish this for him: '
    10: '¹⁰ to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to establish the throne
      of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba!” '
    11: "¹¹ And Ish-bosheth could no longer say a word in response to Abner, because\
      \ he was afraid of him. \n"
    12: '¹² Then Abner sent messengers to David at his place, saying, “Whose is the
      land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring
      all Israel over to you.” '
    13: '¹³ And he said, “Good! I will make a covenant with you, only I require one
      thing of you, namely, that you shall not see my face unless you first bring
      Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me
      my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Ish-bosheth sent men and had her taken from her husband, from Paltiel
      the son of Laish. '
    16: "¹⁶ And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, following her as far\
      \ as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” So he returned. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now Abner had a consultation with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times
      past you were seeking for David to be king over you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now then, do it! For the Lord has spoken regarding David, saying, ‘By
      the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the
      Philistines, and from the hands of all their enemies.’” '
    19: "¹⁹ Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak to David\
      \ in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and to the entire house of\
      \ Benjamin. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David
      held a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. '
    21: "²¹ Abner said to David, “Let me set out and go and gather all Israel to my\
      \ lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may\
      \ be king over all that your soul desires.” So David let Abner go, and he went\
      \ in peace. \n"
    22: '²² And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought
      a large amount of plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron,
      since he had let him go, and he had gone in peace. '
    23: '²³ When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they informed Joab,
      saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go on his
      way, and he has gone in peace.” '
    24: '²⁴ Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner
      came to you; why then have you let him go, so that he is already gone? '
    25: "²⁵ You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to gain your confidence, and\
      \ to learn of your going out and coming in and to find out everything that you\
      \ are doing.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ When Joab left David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they
      brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know about it. '
    27: '²⁷ So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle
      of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly,
      so that he died on account of the blood of his brother Asahel. '
    28: '²⁸ Afterward, when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are
      innocent before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. '
    29: '²⁹ May it turn upon the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and may
      there not be eliminated from the house of Joab someone who suffers a discharge,
      or has leprosy, or holds the spindle, or falls by the sword, or lacks bread.” '
    30: "³⁰ So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put their\
      \ brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear
      your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David walked
      behind the bier. '
    32: '³² And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised his voice and wept
      at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. '
    33: "³³ And the king sang a song of mourning for Abner and said,\n“Should Abner\
      \ die as a fool dies?\n"
    34: "³⁴ Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in bronze shackles;\nAs one\
      \ falls before the wicked, you have fallen.”\nAnd all the people wept over him\
      \ again. "
    35: '³⁵ Then all the people came to provide food for David in his distress while
      it was still day; but David vowed, saying, “May God do so to me, and more so,
      if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.” '
    36: '³⁶ Now all the people took note of David’s vow, and it pleased them, just
      as everything that the king did pleased all the people. '
    37: '³⁷ So all the people and all Israel understood on that day that it had not
      been the desire of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death. '
    38: '³⁸ Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a leader and
      a great man has fallen in Israel this day? '
    39: ³⁹ And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah,
      are too difficult for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer in proportion to his
      evil.”
  4:
    1: '¹ Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his
      courage failed, and all Israel was horrified. '
    2: '² And Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of troops: the name of the
      one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,
      of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin, '
    3: "³ and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as strangers until\
      \ this day). \n"
    4: "⁴ Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was disabled in both feet. He was\
      \ five years old when the news of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his\
      \ nurse picked him up and fled. But it happened that in her hurry to flee, he\
      \ fell and could no longer walk. And his name was Mephibosheth. \n"
    5: '⁵ So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came
      to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while he was taking his
      midday rest. '
    6: '⁶ And they came to the interior of the house as if to get wheat, and they
      struck him in the belly; and Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. '
    7: '⁷ Now when they had come into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his
      bedroom, they struck him and killed him, and they beheaded him. And they took
      his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night. '
    8: "⁸ Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to\
      \ the king, “Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who\
      \ sought your life; so the Lord has given my lord the king vengeance this day\
      \ on Saul and his descendants.” \n"
    9: '⁹ But David replied to Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,
      and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, '
    10: '¹⁰ when the one who informed me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ also viewed
      himself as the bearer of good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which
      was the reward I gave him for his news. '
    11: '¹¹ How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own
      house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hands and eliminate
      you both from the earth?” '
    12: ¹² Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their
      hands and feet, and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the
      head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
  5:
    1: '¹ Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold,
      we are your bone and your flesh. '
    2: '² Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel
      out and in. And the Lord said to you, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and
      you will be a leader over Israel.’” '
    3: '³ So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made
      a covenant with them before the Lord in Hebron; then they anointed David king
      over Israel. '
    4: '⁴ David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned for forty
      years. '
    5: "⁵ At Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem\
      \ he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. \n"
    6: '⁶ Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants
      of the land; and they said to David, “You shall not come in here, but even those
      who are blind and those who limp will turn you away,” thinking, “David cannot
      enter here.” '
    7: '⁷ Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of
      David. '
    8: '⁸ And David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites is to reach those
      who limp and those who are blind, who are hated by David’s soul, through the
      water tunnel.” For that reason they say, “People who are blind and people who
      limp shall not come into the house.” '
    9: '⁹ So David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David
      built all around from the Millo and inward. '
    10: "¹⁰ David became greater and greater, for the Lord God of armies was with\
      \ him. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters,
      and stonemasons; and they built a house for David. '
    12: "¹² And David realized that the Lord had appointed him as king over Israel,\
      \ and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. \n"
    13: '¹³ Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he
      came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David. '
    14: '¹⁴ Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua,
      Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, '
    15: '¹⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, '
    16: "¹⁶ Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over
      Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard
      about it, he went down to the stronghold. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now the Philistines came and overran the Valley of Rephaim. '
    19: '¹⁹ So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines?
      Will You hand them over to me?” And the Lord said to David, “Go up, for I will
      certainly hand the Philistines over to you.” '
    20: '²⁰ Then David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there; and he said,
      “The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters.”
      Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim. '
    21: "²¹ And the Philistines abandoned their idols there, so David and his men\
      \ carried them away. \n"
    22: '²² Now the Philistines came up once again and overran the Valley of Rephaim. '
    23: '²³ So David inquired of the Lord, but He said, “You shall not go directly
      up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the baka-shrubs. '
    24: '²⁴ And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the
      baka-shrubs, then you shall act promptly, for then the Lord will have gone out
      before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” '
    25: ²⁵ Then David did so, just as the Lord had commanded him; he struck and killed
      the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer.
  6:
    1: '¹ Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. '
    2: '² And David departed from Baale-judah, with all the people who were with him,
      to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very
      name of the Lord of armies who is enthroned above the cherubim. '
    3: '³ They had mounted the ark of God on a new cart and moved it from the house
      of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab,
      were leading the new cart. '
    4: '⁴ So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which
      was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark. '
    5: "⁵ Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the\
      \ Lord with all kinds of instruments made of juniper wood, and with lyres, harps,\
      \ tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. \n"
    6: '⁶ But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward
      the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen nearly overturned it. '
    7: '⁷ And the anger of the Lord burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down
      there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God. '
    8: '⁸ Then David became angry because of the Lord’s outburst against Uzzah; and
      that place has been called Perez-uzzah to this day. '
    9: '⁹ So David was afraid of the Lord that day; and he said, “How can the ark
      of the Lord come to me?” '
    10: '¹⁰ And David was unwilling to move the ark of the Lord into the city of David
      with him; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom, the Gittite. '
    11: "¹¹ The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for\
      \ three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household. \n"
    12: '¹² Now it was reported to King David, saying, “The Lord has blessed the house
      of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God.” So
      David went and brought the ark of God up from the house of Obed-edom to the
      city of David with joy. '
    13: '¹³ And so it was, that when those carrying the ark of the Lord marched six
      paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened steer. '
    14: '¹⁴ And David was dancing before the Lord with all his strength, and David
      was wearing a linen ephod. '
    15: "¹⁵ So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the Lord\
      \ with joyful shouting and the sound of the trumpet. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then it happened, as the ark of the Lord was coming into the city of David,\
      \ that Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King\
      \ David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she was contemptuous of him\
      \ in her heart. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now they brought in the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside
      the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and
      peace offerings before the Lord. '
    18: '¹⁸ When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings,
      he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of armies. '
    19: "¹⁹ Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel,\
      \ both to men and women, a cake of bread, one of dates, and one of raisins to\
      \ each one. Then all the people left, each to his house. \n"
    20: '²⁰ But when David returned to bless his own household, Michal the daughter
      of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel dignified himself
      today! For he exposed himself today in the sight of his servants’ female slaves,
      as one of the rabble shamelessly exposes himself!” '
    21: '²¹ But David said to Michal, “I was before the Lord, who preferred me to
      your father and to all his house, to appoint me as ruler over the people of
      the Lord, over Israel. So I will celebrate before the Lord! '
    22: '²² And I might demean myself even more than this and be lowly in my own sight,
      but with the female slaves of whom you have spoken, with them I am to be held
      in honor!” '
    23: ²³ And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
  7:
    1: '¹ Now it came about, when the king lived in his house, and the Lord had given
      him rest on every side from all his enemies, '
    2: '² that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I live in a house of
      cedar, but the ark of God remains within the tent.” '
    3: "³ Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord\
      \ is with you.” \n"
    4: '⁴ But in the same night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “Go and say to My servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Should you
      build Me a house for My dwelling? '
    6: '⁶ For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel
      from Egypt, even to this day; rather, I have been moving about in a tent, that
      is, in a dwelling place. '
    7: "⁷ Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with\
      \ one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel,\
      \ saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’ \n"
    8: '⁸ Now then, this is what you shall say to My servant David: ‘This is what
      the Lord of armies says: “I Myself took you from the pasture, from following
      the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel. '
    9: '⁹ And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have eliminated all
      your enemies from you; I will also make a great name for you, like the names
      of the great men who are on the earth. '
    10: '¹⁰ And I will establish a place for My people Israel, and will plant them,
      so that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will
      malicious people oppress them anymore as previously, '
    11: '¹¹ even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I
      will give you rest from all your enemies. The Lord also declares to you that
      the Lord will make a house for you. '
    12: '¹² When your days are finished and you lie down with your fathers, I will
      raise up your descendant after you, who will come from you, and I will establish
      his kingdom. '
    13: '¹³ He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of
      his kingdom forever. '
    14: '¹⁴ I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he does wrong,
      I will discipline him with a rod of men and with strokes of sons of mankind, '
    15: '¹⁵ but My favor shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom
      I removed from you. '
    16: '¹⁶ Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne
      shall be established forever.”’” '
    17: "¹⁷ In accordance with all these words and all of this vision, so Nathan spoke\
      \ to David. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then David the king came in and sat before the Lord, and he said, “Who
      am I, Lord God, and who are the members of my household, that You have brought
      me this far? '
    19: '¹⁹ And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes, Lord God, for You have spoken
      also of the house of Your servant regarding the distant future. And this is
      the custom of mankind, Lord God. '
    20: '²⁰ Again what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, Lord
      God! '
    21: '²¹ For the sake of Your word, and according to Your heart, You have done
      all this greatness, to let Your servant know. '
    22: '²² For this reason You are great, Lord God; for there is no one like You,
      and there is no God except You, according to all that we have heard with our
      ears. '
    23: '²³ And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God
      went to redeem for Himself as a people, and to make a name for Himself, and
      to do a great thing for You and awesome things for Your land, because of Your
      people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, from other nations and
      their gods? '
    24: '²⁴ For You have established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your own people
      forever, and You, Lord, have become their God. '
    25: '²⁵ Now then, Lord God, the word that You have spoken about Your servant and
      his house, confirm it forever, and do just as You have spoken, '
    26: '²⁶ so that Your name may be great forever, by saying, ‘The Lord of armies
      is God over Israel’; and may the house of Your servant David be established
      before You. '
    27: '²⁷ For You, Lord of armies, God of Israel, have given a revelation to Your
      servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house’; therefore Your servant has found
      courage to pray this prayer to You. '
    28: '²⁸ Now then, Lord God, You are God, and Your words are truth; and You have
      promised this good thing to Your servant. '
    29: ²⁹ And now, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, so that
      it may continue forever before You. For You, Lord God, have spoken; and with
      Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever.”
  8:
    1: "¹ Now it happened afterward that David defeated the Philistines and subdued\
      \ them; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² And He defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down\
      \ on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and a full line\
      \ to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ Then David defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went
      to restore his power at the Euphrates River. '
    4: '⁴ And David captured from him 1,700 horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers;
      and David hamstrung almost all the chariot horses, but left enough of them for
      a hundred chariots. '
    5: '⁵ When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David
      killed twenty-two thousand men among the Arameans. '
    6: '⁶ Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans
      became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the Lord helped David wherever
      he went. '
    7: '⁷ David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer,
      and brought them to Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very\
      \ large amount of bronze. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army
      of Hadadezer, '
    10: '¹⁰ Toi sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and bless him, because
      he had fought Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with
      Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, gold, and bronze. '
    11: '¹¹ King David also consecrated these gifts to the Lord, with the silver and
      gold that he had consecrated from all the nations which he had subdued: '
    12: "¹² from Aram, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, Amalek, and from\
      \ the spoils of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. \n"
    13: '¹³ So David made a name for himself when he returned from killing eighteen
      thousand Arameans in the Valley of Salt. '
    14: "¹⁴ He also put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the\
      \ Edomites became servants to David. And the Lord helped David wherever he went.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness
      for all his people. '
    16: '¹⁶ Joab the son of Zeruiah was commander over the army, and Jehoshaphat the
      son of Ahilud was secretary. '
    17: '¹⁷ Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests,
      and Seraiah was scribe. '
    18: ¹⁸ Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
      and David’s sons were chief ministers.
  9:
    1: '¹ Then David said, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul, so that
      I could show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” '
    2: '² Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they
      summoned him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” And he said,
      “I am your servant.” '
    3: '³ Then the king said, “Is there no one remaining of the house of Saul to whom
      I could show the kindness of God?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still
      a son of Jonathan, one who is disabled in both feet.” '
    4: '⁴ So the king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “Behold,
      he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.” '
    5: '⁵ Then King David sent messengers who brought him from the house of Machir
      the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. '
    6: '⁶ Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell
      on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, “Mephibosheth.” And he said,
      “Here is your servant!” '
    7: '⁷ Then David said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I will assuredly show kindness
      to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the
      land of your grandfather Saul; and you yourself shall eat at my table regularly.” '
    8: "⁸ Again he prostrated himself, and said, “What is your servant, that you should\
      \ be concerned about a dead dog like me?” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “Everything
      that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s grandson. '
    10: '¹⁰ You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him,
      and you shall bring in the produce so that your master’s grandson will have
      food to eat; nevertheless Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, shall eat at
      my table regularly.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Ziba said to the king, “In accordance with everything that my lord
      the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate
      at David’s table as one of the king’s sons. '
    12: '¹² Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in
      the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth. '
    13: ¹³ So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he ate at the king’s table
      regularly. And he was disabled in his two feet.
  10:
    1: '¹ Now it happened afterward that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son
      Hanun became king in his place. '
    2: '² Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just
      as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent some of his servants to
      console him about his father. But when David’s servants came to the land of
      the Ammonites, '
    3: '³ the commanders of the Ammonites said to their lord Hanun, “Do you think
      that David is simply honoring your father since he has sent you servants to
      console you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to explore the
      city, to spy it out and overthrow it?” '
    4: '⁴ So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half of their beards, and
      cut off their robes in the middle as far as their buttocks, and sent them away. '
    5: "⁵ When messengers informed David, he sent servants to meet them, because the\
      \ men were extremely humiliated. And the king said, “Stay in Jericho until your\
      \ beards grow back, and then you shall return.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Now when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become repulsive to David,
      the sons of Ammon sent messengers and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the
      Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with
      a thousand men, and the men of Tob with twelve thousand men. '
    7: '⁷ When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all the army, the warriors. '
    8: "⁸ And the sons of Ammon came out and lined up for battle at the entrance of\
      \ the city, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and\
      \ Maacah were stationed by themselves in the field. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him at the front and at
      the rear, he selected warriors from all the choice men in Israel, and lined
      them up against the Arameans. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the remainder of the people he placed under the command of his brother
      Abishai, and he lined them up against the sons of Ammon. '
    11: '¹¹ And he said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help
      me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help
      you. '
    12: '¹² Be strong, and let’s show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people
      and the cities of our God; and may the Lord do what is good in His sight.” '
    13: '¹³ So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to the battle against
      the Arameans, and they fled from him. '
    14: "¹⁴ When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled\
      \ from Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against\
      \ the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they assembled
      together. '
    16: '¹⁶ And Hadadezer sent word and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the
      Euphrates River, and they came to Helam; and Shobach the commander of the army
      of Hadadezer led them. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now when it was reported to David, he gathered all Israel together and
      crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans lined up against David
      and fought him. '
    18: '¹⁸ But the Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed seven hundred charioteers
      of the Arameans and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the commander
      of their army, and he died there. '
    19: ¹⁹ When all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw that they had been defeated
      by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans were
      afraid to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
  11:
    1: "¹ Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle,\
      \ that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they brought\
      \ destruction on the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in\
      \ Jerusalem. \n"
    2: '² Now at evening time David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof
      of the king’s house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman
      was very beautiful in appearance. '
    3: '³ So David sent servants and inquired about the woman. And someone said, “Is
      this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” '
    4: '⁴ Then David sent messengers and had her brought, and when she came to him,
      he slept with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she
      returned to her house. '
    5: "⁵ But the woman conceived; so she sent word and informed David, and said,\
      \ “I am pregnant.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then David sent word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent
      Uriah to David. '
    7: '⁷ When Uriah came to him, David asked about Joab’s well-being and that of
      the people, and the condition of the war. '
    8: '⁸ Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” So
      Uriah left the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him. '
    9: '⁹ But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of
      his lord, and did not go down to his house. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now when they informed David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,”
      David said to Uriah, “Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down
      to your house?” '
    11: '¹¹ And Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in
      temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping
      in the open field. Should I then go to my house to eat and drink and to sleep
      with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.” '
    12: '¹² Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let
      you go back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the day after. '
    13: "¹³ Now David summoned Uriah, and he ate and drank in his presence, and he\
      \ made Uriah drunk; and in the evening Uriah went out to lie on his bed with\
      \ his lord’s servants, and he still did not go down to his house. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand
      of Uriah. '
    15: '¹⁵ He had written in the letter the following: “Station Uriah on the front
      line of the fiercest battle and pull back from him, so that he may be struck
      and killed.” '
    16: '¹⁶ So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he stationed Uriah at the
      place where he knew there were valiant men. '
    17: '¹⁷ And the men of the city went out and fought against Joab, and some of
      the people among David’s servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then Joab sent a messenger and reported to David all the events of the
      war. '
    19: '¹⁹ He ordered the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all
      the events of the war to the king, '
    20: '²⁰ then it shall be that if the king’s wrath rises and he says to you, ‘Why
      did you move against the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot
      from the wall? '
    21: "²¹ Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did a woman not throw an\
      \ upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you\
      \ move against the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite\
      \ also died.’” \n"
    22: '²² So the messenger departed and came and reported to David everything that
      Joab had sent him to tell. '
    23: '²³ The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us and came out
      against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate. '
    24: '²⁴ Also, the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the
      king’s servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.” '
    25: "²⁵ Then David said to the messenger, “This is what you shall say to Joab:\
      \ ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as\
      \ another; fight with determination against the city and overthrow it’; and\
      \ thereby encourage him.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now when Uriah’s wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned
      for her husband. '
    27: ²⁷ When the time of mourning was over, David sent servants and had her brought
      to his house and she became his wife; then she bore him a son. But the thing
      that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord.
  12:
    1: "¹ Then the Lord sent Nathan to David. And he came to him and said,\n“There\
      \ were two men in a city, the one wealthy and the other poor.\n"
    2: "² The wealthy man had a great many flocks and herds.\n"
    3: "³ But the poor man had nothing at all except one little ewe lamb\nWhich he\
      \ bought and nurtured;\nAnd it grew up together with him and his children.\n\
      It would eat scraps from him and drink from his cup and lie in his lap,\nAnd\
      \ was like a daughter to him.\n"
    4: "⁴ Now a visitor came to the wealthy man,\nAnd he could not bring himself to\
      \ take any animal from his own flock or his own herd,\nTo prepare for the traveler\
      \ who had come to him;\nSo he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for\
      \ the man who had come to him.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then David’s anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan,
      “As the Lord lives, the man who has done this certainly deserves to die! '
    6: "⁶ So he must make restitution for the lamb four times over, since he did this\
      \ thing and had no compassion.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Nathan then said to David, “You yourself are the man! This is what the Lord,
      the God of Israel says: ‘It is I who anointed you as king over Israel, and it
      is I who rescued you from the hand of Saul. '
    8: '⁸ I also gave you your master’s house and put your master’s wives into your
      care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if that had been too
      little, I would have added to you many more things like these! '
    9: '⁹ Why have you despised the word of the Lord, by doing evil in His sight?
      You have struck and killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, you have taken
      his wife as your wife, and you have slaughtered him with the sword of the sons
      of Ammon. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now then, the sword shall never leave your house, because you have despised
      Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ '
    11: '¹¹ This is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I am going to raise up evil against
      you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes and
      give them to your companion, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight. '
    12: '¹² Indeed, you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel,
      and in open daylight.’” '
    13: '¹³ Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” And Nathan
      said to David, “The Lord also has allowed your sin to pass; you shall not die. '
    14: '¹⁴ However, since by this deed you have shown utter disrespect for the Lord,
      the child himself who is born to you shall certainly die.” '
    15: "¹⁵ Then Nathan went to his house.\nLater the Lord struck the child that Uriah’s\
      \ widow bore to David, so that he was very sick. "
    16: '¹⁶ David therefore pleaded with God for the child; and David fasted and went
      and lay all night on the ground. '
    17: '¹⁷ The elders of his household stood beside him in order to help him up from
      the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. And David’s servants
      were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while
      the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he did not listen to us. How
      then can we tell him that the child is dead, since he might do himself harm?” '
    19: '¹⁹ But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived
      that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”
      And they said, “He is dead.” '
    20: "²⁰ So David got up from the ground, washed, anointed himself, and changed\
      \ his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he\
      \ went to his own house, and when he asked, they served him food, and he ate.\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done?
      You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died,
      you got up and ate food.” '
    22: '²² And he said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for
      I said, ‘Who knows, the Lord may be gracious to me, and the child may live.’ '
    23: "²³ But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I\
      \ am going to him, but he will not return to me.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went in to her and slept
      with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. Now the Lord
      loved him, '
    25: "²⁵ and sent word through Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah for\
      \ the Lord’s sake. \n"
    26: '²⁶ Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and captured the
      royal city. '
    27: '²⁷ Then Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah,
      I have even captured the city of waters. '
    28: '²⁸ Now then, gather the rest of the people and camp opposite the city and
      capture it, or I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me.” '
    29: '²⁹ So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, and he fought against
      it and captured it. '
    30: '³⁰ Then he took the crown of their king from his head; and its weight was
      a talent of gold, and it had a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s
      head. And he brought out the plunder of the city in great amounts. '
    31: ³¹ He also brought out the people who were in it, and put some to work at
      saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and made others serve at the brick works. And
      he did the same to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the
      people returned to Jerusalem.
  13:
    1: '¹ Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister
      whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David was in love with her. '
    2: '² But Amnon was so frustrated on account of his sister Tamar that he made
      himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed too difficult to Amnon to do
      anything to her. '
    3: '³ But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s
      brother; and Jonadab was a very clever man. '
    4: '⁴ And he said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed morning after
      morning? Will you not tell me?” So Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar,
      the sister of my brother Absalom.” '
    5: '⁵ Jonadab then said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when
      your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please have my sister Tamar come
      and give me food to eat, and have her prepare the food in my sight, so that
      I may see it and eat from her hand.’” '
    6: "⁶ So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him,\
      \ Amnon said to the king, “Please have my sister Tamar come and make me a couple\
      \ of pastries in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then David sent a messenger to the house for Tamar, saying, “Go now to your
      brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.” '
    8: '⁸ So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was lying in bed. And
      she took dough, kneaded it, made pastries in his sight, and baked the pastries. '
    9: '⁹ Then she took the tray and served them to him, but he refused to eat. And
      Amnon said, “Have everyone leave me.” So everyone left him. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I
      may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the pastries which she had made and brought
      them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon. '
    11: '¹¹ When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her,
      “Come, sleep with me, my sister.” '
    12: '¹² But she said to him, “No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing
      is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful sin! '
    13: '¹³ As for me, where could I get rid of my shame? And as for you, you will
      be like one of the fools in Israel. Now then, please speak to the king, for
      he will not withhold me from you.” '
    14: "¹⁴ However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he\
      \ violated her and slept with her. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; indeed, the hatred with
      which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And
      Amnon said to her, “Get up, go away!” '
    16: '¹⁶ But she said to him, “No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater
      than the other that you have done to me!” Yet he would not listen to her. '
    17: '¹⁷ Then he called his young man who attended him and said, “Now throw this
      woman out of my presence, and lock the door behind her!” '
    18: '¹⁸ Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for this is how the virgin daughters
      of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and
      locked the door behind her. '
    19: "¹⁹ Tamar took ashes and put them on her head, and tore her long-sleeved garment\
      \ which was on her; and she put her hand on her head and went on her way, crying\
      \ out as she went. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with
      you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter
      to heart.” So Tamar remained and was isolated in her brother Absalom’s house. '
    21: '²¹ Now when King David heard about all these matters, he became very angry. '
    22: "²² But Absalom did not speak with Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated\
      \ Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar. \n"
    23: "²³ Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers\
      \ in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons\
      \ to celebrate. \n"
    24: '²⁴ And Absalom came to the king and said, “Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers;
      may the king and his servants please go with your servant.” '
    25: '²⁵ But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, so that
      we will not be a burden to you.” Though he urged him, he would not go; but he
      blessed him. '
    26: '²⁶ Then Absalom said, “If not, please have my brother Amnon go with us.”
      But the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” '
    27: "²⁷ Nevertheless Absalom urged him, so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons\
      \ go with him. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “See now, when Amnon’s heart
      is cheerful with wine, and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then put him to death.
      Do not fear; have I not commanded you myself? Be courageous and be valiant.” '
    29: "²⁹ And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded.\
      \ Then all the king’s sons got up and each mounted his mule and fled. \n"
    30: '³⁰ Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying,
      “Absalom has struck and killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.” '
    31: '³¹ Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay on the ground; and all
      his servants were standing by with clothes torn. '
    32: '³² And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Let my lord
      not assume that they have put to death all the young men, the king’s sons, for
      only Amnon is dead; because this has been set up by the intent of Absalom since
      the day that he violated his sister Tamar. '
    33: "³³ So now, may my lord the king not take the report to heart, claiming, ‘all\
      \ the king’s sons are dead’; but only Amnon is dead.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his
      eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him
      by the side of the mountain. '
    35: '³⁵ And Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons have come; so it
      has happened according to your servant’s word.” '
    36: "³⁶ As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came and\
      \ raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept\
      \ very profusely. \n"
    37: '³⁷ Now Absalom had fled and gone to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of
      Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. '
    38: '³⁸ So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there for three years. '
    39: ³⁹ And the heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted
      regarding Amnon, since he was dead.
  14:
    1: '¹ Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was drawn toward
      Absalom. '
    2: '² So Joab sent a messenger to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there, and
      said to her, “Please follow mourning rites, and put on mourning garments now,
      and do not anoint yourself with oil but be like a woman who has been mourning
      for the dead for many days. '
    3: "³ Then go to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab put the words\
      \ in her mouth. \n"
    4: '⁴ Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the
      ground and prostrated herself, and said, “Help, O king!” '
    5: '⁵ And the king said to her, “What is troubling you?” And she answered, “Truly
      I am a widow, for my husband is dead. '
    6: '⁶ And your servant had two sons, but the two of them fought in the field,
      and there was no one to save them from each other, so one struck the other and
      killed him. '
    7: "⁷ Now behold, the entire family has risen against your servant, and they have\
      \ said, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, so that we may put him to\
      \ death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and eliminate the heir as\
      \ well.’ So they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband\
      \ neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your home, and I will issue orders
      concerning you.” '
    9: '⁹ The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, the king, the guilt is on
      me and my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.” '
    10: '¹⁰ So the king said, “Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will
      not touch you anymore.” '
    11: "¹¹ Then she said, “May the king please remember the Lord your God, so that\
      \ the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy\
      \ my son.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall\
      \ to the ground.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord
      the king.” And he said, “Speak.” '
    13: '¹³ The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people
      of God? For in speaking this word the king is like one who is guilty, in that
      the king does not bring back his banished one. '
    14: '¹⁴ For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground, which
      cannot be gathered up. Yet God does not take away life, but makes plans so that
      the banished one will not be cast out from Him. '
    15: '¹⁵ Now then, the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king
      is that the people have made me afraid; so your servant said, ‘Let me now speak
      to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his slave. '
    16: '¹⁶ For the king will listen, to save his slave from the hand of the man who
      would eliminate both me and my son from the inheritance of God.’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting,\
      \ for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil.\
      \ And may the Lord your God be with you.’” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide anything
      from me that I am about to ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king
      please speak.” '
    19: '¹⁹ So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the
      woman replied, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the
      right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed,
      it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words
      in the mouth of your servant. '
    20: "²⁰ In order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done\
      \ this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know\
      \ all that is on the earth.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I will certainly do this thing;
      go then, bring back the young man Absalom.” '
    22: '²² And Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself, and blessed
      the king; then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor
      in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has performed the request
      of his servant.” '
    23: '²³ So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. '
    24: "²⁴ However, the king said, “He shall return to his own house, but he shall\
      \ not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the\
      \ king’s face. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now in all Israel there was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised;
      from the sole of his foot to the top of his head there was no impairment in
      him. '
    26: '²⁶ And when he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year
      that he cut it, because it was heavy on him, so he cut it), he weighed the hair
      of his head at two hundred shekels by the king’s weight. '
    27: "²⁷ And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name\
      \ was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance. \n"
    28: '²⁸ Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, yet he did not see the
      king’s face. '
    29: '²⁹ Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not
      come to him. So he sent word again a second time, but he would not come. '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s plot is next to mine,
      and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the
      plot on fire. '
    31: '³¹ Then Joab got up, came to Absalom at his house, and said to him, “Why
      have your servants set my plot on fire?” '
    32: '³² Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, so
      that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would
      be better for me still to be there.”’ Now then, let me see the king’s face,
      and if there is guilt in me, he can have me executed.” '
    33: ³³ So when Joab came to the king and told him, he summoned Absalom. Then Absalom
      came to the king and prostrated himself with his face to the ground before the
      king; and the king kissed Absalom.
  15:
    1: '¹ Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot
      and horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him. '
    2: '² And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the road to the gate; and
      when any man who had a lawsuit was to come before the king for judgment, Absalom
      would call out to him and say, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your
      servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” '
    3: '³ Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but
      you have no one to listen to you on the part of the king.” '
    4: '⁴ Moreover, Absalom would say, “Oh that someone would appoint me judge in
      the land, then every man who has a lawsuit or claim could come to me, and I
      would give him justice!” '
    5: '⁵ And whenever a man approached to prostrate himself before him, he would
      put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. '
    6: "⁶ Absalom dealt this way with all Israel who came to the king for judgment;\
      \ so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now it came about at the end of four years that Absalom said to the king,
      “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the Lord, in Hebron. '
    8: '⁸ For your servant made a vow while I was living in Geshur in Aram, saying,
      ‘If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.’” '
    9: '⁹ The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron. '
    10: '¹⁰ But Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon
      as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in
      Hebron!’” '
    11: '¹¹ Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited
      and went innocently, for they did not know anything. '
    12: "¹² And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from\
      \ his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was\
      \ strong, for the people continually increased with Absalom. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the people of Israel
      are with Absalom.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Arise
      and let’s flee, for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom. Go quickly,
      or he will hurry and overtake us, and bring disaster on us and strike the city
      with the edge of the sword.” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants will
      do whatever my lord the king chooses.” '
    16: '¹⁶ So the king left, and all his household with him; but the king left ten
      concubines behind to take care of the house. '
    17: '¹⁷ The king left, and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last
      house. '
    18: "¹⁸ Now all of his servants passed by beside him, and all the Cherethites,\
      \ all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with\
      \ him from Gath, passed by before the king. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you go with us too?
      Return and stay with your king, since you are a foreigner and an exile as well;
      return to your own place. '
    20: '²⁰ You came only yesterday, so should I make you wander with us today, while
      I go wherever I go? Return and take your brothers back; mercy and truth be with
      you.” '
    21: '²¹ But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the Lord lives, and as my lord
      the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life,
      there assuredly shall your servant be!” '
    22: '²² Then David said to Ittai, “Go and cross over the brook Kidron.” So Ittai
      the Gittite crossed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with
      him. '
    23: "²³ While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people were\
      \ crossing over. The king was also crossing over the brook Kidron, and all the\
      \ people were crossing over toward the way of the wilderness. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Now behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the
      ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came
      up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city. '
    25: '²⁵ And the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find
      favor in the sight of the Lord, then He will bring me back and show me both
      it and His habitation. '
    26: '²⁶ But if He says this: ‘I have no delight in you,’ then here I am, let Him
      do to me as seems good to Him.” '
    27: '²⁷ The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to
      the city in peace, and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan
      the son of Abiathar. '
    28: '²⁸ See, I am going to wait at the river crossing places of the wilderness
      until word comes from you to inform me.” '
    29: "²⁹ So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained\
      \ there. \n"
    30: '³⁰ And David was going up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he
      went, and his head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. Then all the people
      who were with him each covered his own head, and they were going up, weeping
      as they went. '
    31: "³¹ Now someone informed David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators\
      \ with Absalom.” And David said, “Lord, please make the advice of Ahithophel\
      \ foolish.” \n"
    32: '³² It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped,
      that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn, and dust on his
      head. '
    33: '³³ And David said to him, “If you go over with me, then you will become a
      burden to me. '
    34: '³⁴ But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant,
      O king; even as I was your father’s servant in time past, so now I will also
      be your servant,’ then you can foil the advice of Ahithophel for me. '
    35: '³⁵ Are Zadok and Abiathar the priests not with you there? So it shall be
      that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and
      Abiathar the priests. '
    36: '³⁶ Behold their two sons are there with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan,
      Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear.” '
    37: ³⁷ So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
  16:
    1: '¹ Now when David had gone on a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the
      servant of Mephibosheth met him with a team of saddled donkeys, and on them
      were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred summer
      fruits, and a jug of wine. '
    2: '² And the king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” And Ziba said, “The
      donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are
      for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is weary in the wilderness
      to drink.” '
    3: '³ Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the
      king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of
      Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’” '
    4: "⁴ So the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.”\
      \ And Ziba said, “I prostrate myself; may I find favor in your sight, my lord,\
      \ the king!” \n"
    5: '⁵ When King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man was coming out from there
      from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei, the son of Gera;
      he was coming out, cursing as he came. '
    6: '⁶ He also threw stones at David and all the servants of King David; and all
      the people and all the warriors were on his right and on his left. '
    7: '⁷ This is what Shimei said when he cursed: “Go away, go away, you man of bloodshed
      and worthless man! '
    8: "⁸ The Lord has brought back upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul,\
      \ in whose place you have become king; and the Lord has handed the kingdom over\
      \ to your son Absalom. And behold, you are caught in your own evil, for you\
      \ are a man of bloodshed!” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead
      dog curse my lord the king? Now let me go over and cut off his head.” '
    10: '¹⁰ But the king said, “What business of mine is yours, you sons of Zeruiah?
      If he curses, and if the Lord has told him, ‘Curse David,’ then who should say,
      ‘Why have you done so?’” '
    11: '¹¹ Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my son who
      came out of my own body seeks my life; how much more now this Benjaminite? Leave
      him alone and let him curse, for the Lord has told him. '
    12: '¹² Perhaps the Lord will look on my misery and return good to me instead
      of his cursing this day.” '
    13: '¹³ So David and his men went on the road; and Shimei kept going on the hillside
      close beside him, and as he went he cursed and threw stones and dirt at him. '
    14: "¹⁴ And the king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted, and\
      \ he refreshed himself there. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem,
      and Ahithophel with him. '
    16: '¹⁶ Now it came about, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom,
      that Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” '
    17: '¹⁷ But Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why
      did you not go with your friend?” '
    18: '¹⁸ So Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whomever the Lord, this people, and
      all the men of Israel have chosen, his I shall be, and with him I shall remain. '
    19: "¹⁹ Besides, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his\
      \ son? Just as I have served in your father’s presence, so I shall be in your\
      \ presence.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What should we do?” '
    21: '²¹ Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Have relations with your father’s concubines,
      whom he has left behind to take care of the house; then all Israel will hear
      that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. The hands of all who are
      with you will also be strengthened.” '
    22: '²² So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom had relations
      with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. '
    23: ²³ Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was taken as
      though one inquired of the word of God; so was all the advice of Ahithophel
      regarded by both David and Absalom.
  17:
    1: '¹ Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose twelve thousand
      men and let me set out and pursue David tonight. '
    2: '² And I will attack him while he is weary and exhausted and startle him, so
      that all the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike and kill
      the king when he is alone, '
    3: '³ and I will bring all the people back to you. The return of everyone depends
      on the man whom you are seeking; then all the people will be at peace.” '
    4: "⁴ And the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel. \n"
    5: '⁵ Nevertheless, Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s
      hear what he has to say.” '
    6: '⁶ When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has proposed
      this plan. Should we carry out his plan? If not, say so yourself.” '
    7: '⁷ So Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the advice that Ahithophel has given
      is not good.” '
    8: '⁸ Then Hushai said, “You yourself know your father and his men, that they
      are warriors and they are fierce, like a bear deprived of her cubs in the field.
      And your father is an expert in warfare, and he will not spend the night with
      the people. '
    9: '⁹ Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the ravines, or in another place;
      and it will be that when he falls on them at the first attack, whoever hears
      it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’ '
    10: '¹⁰ And even the one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion,
      will completely despair; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man,
      and those who are with him are valiant men. '
    11: '¹¹ But I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, from Dan even to
      Beersheba, like the sand that is by the sea in abundance; and that you personally
      go into battle. '
    12: '¹² Then we will come to him in one of the places where he can be found, and
      we will fall on him just as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all
      the men who are with him, not even one will be left. '
    13: '¹³ And if he withdraws into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to
      that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a pebble is found
      there.” '
    14: "¹⁴ Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the\
      \ Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” For the Lord had ordained\
      \ to foil the good advice of Ahithophel, in order for the Lord to bring disaster\
      \ on Absalom. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “This is what Ahithophel
      advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do, and this is what I have advised. '
    16: '¹⁶ Now then, send a messenger quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend
      the night at the river crossing places of the wilderness, but by all means cross
      over, or else the king and all the people who are with him will be destroyed.’” '
    17: '¹⁷ Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a female servant
      would go and inform them, and they would go and inform King David, for they
      could not allow themselves to be seen entering the city. '
    18: '¹⁸ But a boy did see them, and he told Absalom; so the two of them left quickly
      and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard,
      and they went down into it. '
    19: '¹⁹ And the woman took a cover and spread it over the well’s mouth and scattered
      barley meal on it, so that nothing was known. '
    20: "²⁰ Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said, “Where\
      \ are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have crossed\
      \ the brook of water.” And when they searched and did not find them, they returned\
      \ to Jerusalem. \n"
    21: '²¹ It came about after they had departed, that they came up out of the well
      and went and reported to King David; and they said to David, “Set out and cross
      over the water quickly, because this is what Ahithophel has advised against
      you.” '
    22: "²² Then David and all the people who were with him set out and crossed the\
      \ Jordan; by dawn not even one remained who had not crossed the Jordan. \n"
    23: "²³ Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled\
      \ his donkey and set out and went to his home, to his city, and set his house\
      \ in order, and hanged himself; so he died and was buried in his father’s grave.\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all
      the men of Israel with him. '
    25: '²⁵ Absalom put Amasa in command of the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was
      the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had relations with
      Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. '
    26: "²⁶ And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah
      of the sons of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai
      the Gileadite from Rogelim, '
    28: '²⁸ brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans,
      lentils, roasted seeds, '
    29: ²⁹ honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who
      were with him, to eat. For they said, “The people are hungry and exhausted and
      thirsty in the wilderness.”
  18:
    1: '¹ Then David took a count of the people who were with him and appointed over
      them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. '
    2: '² And David sent the people out, a third under the command of Joab, a third
      under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third
      under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I
      myself will certainly go out with you also.” '
    3: '³ But the people said, “You should not go out; for if in fact we flee, they
      will not care about us; and if half of us die, they will not care about us.
      But you are worth ten thousand of us; so now it is better that you will be ready
      to help us from the city.” '
    4: '⁴ Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the
      king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and thousands. '
    5: "⁵ But the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently with\
      \ the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the people heard when the king\
      \ commanded all the commanders regarding Absalom. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the people went out to the field against Israel, and the battle took
      place in the forest of Ephraim. '
    7: '⁷ The people of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the
      slaughter there that day was great, twenty thousand men. '
    8: "⁸ For the battle there was spread over the whole countryside, and the forest\
      \ devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now Absalom encountered the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his
      mule, and the mule went under the branches of a massive oak. Then his head caught
      firmly in the oak, and he was left hanging between the sky and earth, while
      the mule that was under him kept going. '
    10: '¹⁰ When a certain man saw him, he informed Joab and said, “Behold, I saw
      Absalom hanging in an oak.” '
    11: '¹¹ Then Joab said to the man who had informed him, “So behold, you saw him!
      Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? And it would have been
      my duty to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.” '
    12: '¹² But the man said to Joab, “Even if I were to receive a thousand pieces
      of silver in my hand, I would not put out my hand against the king’s son; for
      in our hearing the king commanded you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, ‘Protect
      the young man Absalom for me!’ '
    13: '¹³ Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is
      nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have avoided me.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then Joab said, “I will not waste time here with you.” So he took three
      spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was
      still alive in the midst of the oak. '
    15: "¹⁵ And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor gathered around and struck\
      \ Absalom and killed him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel,
      for Joab restrained the people. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they took Absalom and threw him into a deep pit in the forest, and
      erected over him a very large pile of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his
      own tent. '
    18: "¹⁸ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a memorial\
      \ stone, which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to continue\
      \ my name.” So he named the memorial stone after his own name, and it is called\
      \ Absalom’s Monument to this day. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the king
      news that the Lord has freed him from the hand of his enemies!” '
    20: '²⁰ But Joab said to him, “You are not the man to bring news this day, but
      you shall bring news another day; however, you shall bring no news this day,
      because the king’s son is dead.” '
    21: '²¹ Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.”
      So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran. '
    22: '²² However, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to Joab, “But whatever
      happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” And Joab said, “Why would
      you run, my son, since you will have no messenger’s reward for going?” '
    23: "²³ “But whatever happens,” he said, “I will run.” So he said to him, “Run.”\
      \ Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed by the Cushite. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went to
      the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and looked; and behold,
      a man was running by himself. '
    25: '²⁵ So the watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, “If he
      is by himself there is good news in his mouth.” And he came nearer and nearer. '
    26: '²⁶ Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to
      the gatekeeper and said, “Behold, another man is running by himself.” And the
      king said, “This one also is bringing good news.” '
    27: "²⁷ The watchman said, “I think the running form of the first one is like\
      \ the running form of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “This is\
      \ a good man, and he is coming with good news.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well.” And he prostrated
      himself before the king with his face to the ground. And he said, “Blessed is
      the Lord your God, who has turned over the men who raised their hands against
      my lord the king.” '
    29: '²⁹ But the king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And Ahimaaz
      answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, and your servant, I saw a great
      commotion, but I did not know what it was.” '
    30: "³⁰ Then the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and\
      \ stood still. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then behold, the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, “Let my lord the
      king receive good news, for the Lord has freed you this day from the hand of
      all those who rose up against you.” '
    32: "³² Then the king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?”\
      \ And the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who\
      \ rise up against you for evil, be like that young man!” \n"
    33: '³³ Then the king trembled and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept.
      And this is what he said as he walked: “My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!
      If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!”'
  19:
    1: '¹ Then it was reported to Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and he mourns
      for Absalom.” '
    2: '² So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, because
      the people heard it said that day, “The king is in mourning over his son.” '
    3: '³ And the people entered the city surreptitiously that day, just as people
      who are humiliated surreptitiously flee in battle. '
    4: '⁴ And the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “My son Absalom,
      Absalom, my son, my son!” '
    5: '⁵ Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have shamed
      all your servants, who have saved your life today and the lives of your sons
      and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines, '
    6: '⁶ by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you
      have revealed today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for I know
      today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then it would
      be right as far as you are concerned. '
    7: "⁷ Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear\
      \ by the Lord, if you do not go out, no man will stay the night with you, and\
      \ this will be worse for you than all the misfortune that has happened to you\
      \ from your youth until now!” \n"
    8: "⁸ So the king got up and sat at the gate. When they told all the people, saying,\
      \ “Behold, the king is sitting at the gate,” then all the people came before\
      \ the king.\nNow Israel had fled, each to his tent. "
    9: '⁹ And all the people were quarreling throughout the tribes of Israel, saying,
      “The king rescued us from the hands of our enemies and saved us from the hands
      of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. '
    10: "¹⁰ However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now then,\
      \ why are you silent about bringing the king back?” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak
      to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back
      to his house, since the word of all Israel has come to the king, even to his
      house? '
    12: '¹² You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you
      be the last to bring back the king?’ '
    13: '¹³ And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to
      me, and more so, if you will not be commander of the army for me continually,
      in place of Joab.’” '
    14: '¹⁴ So he turned the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they
      sent word to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.” '
    15: "¹⁵ The king then returned and came as far as the Jordan. And the men of Judah\
      \ came to Gilgal in order to go to meet the king, to escort the king across\
      \ the Jordan. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite who was from Bahurim, hurried
      and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David. '
    17: '¹⁷ And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant
      of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him;
      and they rushed to the Jordan before the king. '
    18: '¹⁸ Then they crossed the shallow places repeatedly to bring over the king’s
      household, and to do what was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera
      fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan. '
    19: '¹⁹ And he said to the king, “May my lord not consider me guilty, nor call
      to mind what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king went out
      from Jerusalem, so that the king would take it to heart. '
    20: '²⁰ For your servant knows that I have sinned; so behold, I have come today,
      the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.” '
    21: '²¹ But Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded, “Should Shimei not be put to
      death for this, the fact that he cursed the Lord’s anointed?” '
    22: '²² David then said, “What is there between you and me, you sons of Zeruiah,
      that you should be an adversary to me today? Should anyone be put to death in
      Israel today? For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?” '
    23: "²³ So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” The king also swore to\
      \ him. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Mephibosheth the grandson of Saul came down to meet the king; but
      he had neither tended to his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his
      clothes since the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. '
    25: '²⁵ And it was when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king
      said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?” '
    26: '²⁶ So he said, “My lord the king, my servant betrayed me; for your servant
      said, ‘I will saddle the donkey for myself so that I may ride on it and go with
      the king,’ since your servant cannot walk. '
    27: '²⁷ Furthermore, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my
      lord the king is like the angel of God, therefore do what is good in your sight. '
    28: '²⁸ For all my father’s household was only people worthy of death to my lord
      the king; yet you placed your servant among those who ate at your own table.
      So what right do I still have, that I should complain anymore to the king?” '
    29: '²⁹ So the king said to him, “Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have
      decided, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’” '
    30: "³⁰ And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take it all, since my\
      \ lord the king has come safely to his own house.” \n"
    31: '³¹ Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on
      to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan. '
    32: '³² Barzillai was very old: eighty years old; and he had provided the king
      food while he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very great man. '
    33: '³³ So the king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me, and I will provide
      you food in Jerusalem with me.” '
    34: '³⁴ But Barzillai said to the king, “How long do I still have to live, that
      I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? '
    35: '³⁵ I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Or
      can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice
      of men and women singing? Why then should your servant be an added burden to
      my lord the king? '
    36: '³⁶ Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. So why
      should the king compensate me with this reward? '
    37: '³⁷ Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own city near
      the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham;
      let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your
      sight.” '
    38: '³⁸ And the king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do
      for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do
      for you.” '
    39: "³⁹ All the people crossed over the Jordan and the king crossed too. The king\
      \ then kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all
      the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king. '
    41: '⁴¹ And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king,
      “Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, abducted you and brought the king
      and his household and all David’s men with him, over the Jordan?” '
    42: '⁴² Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king
      is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we
      eaten at all at the king’s expense, or has anything been taken for us?” '
    43: ⁴³ But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “We have ten
      parts in the king, therefore we also have more claim on David than you. Why
      then did you treat us with contempt? Was it not our advice first to bring back
      our king?” Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of
      the men of Israel.
  20:
    1: "¹ Now a worthless man happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of\
      \ Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew the trumpet and said,\n“We have no share\
      \ in David,\nNor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse;\nEvery man to\
      \ his tents, Israel!” \n"
    2: "² So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba\
      \ the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, from\
      \ the Jordan even to Jerusalem. \n"
    3: "³ Then David came to his house in Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women,\
      \ the concubines whom he had left behind to take care of the house, and put\
      \ them in custody and provided them with food, but did not have relations with\
      \ them. So they were locked up until the day of their death, living as widows.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Now the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah for me within three
      days, and be present here yourself.” '
    5: '⁵ So Amasa went to summon the men of Judah, but he was delayed longer than
      the set time which he had designated for him. '
    6: '⁶ And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more
      harm than Absalom; take your lord’s servants and pursue him, so that he does
      not find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight.” '
    7: '⁷ So Joab’s men went out after him, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites,
      and all the warriors; and they left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. '
    8: '⁸ When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet
      them. Now Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it he had a belt
      with a sword in its sheath strapped on at his waist; and as he went forward,
      it fell out. '
    9: "⁹ And Joab said to Amasa, “Is it going well for you, my brother?” And Joab\
      \ took hold of Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was in Joab’s hand,
      so he struck him in the belly with it and spilled out his intestines on the
      ground, and did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and his brother
      Abishai pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. '
    11: '¹¹ Now one of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever favors Joab
      and whoever is for David, follow Joab!” '
    12: "¹² But Amasa was wallowing in his own blood in the middle of the road. And\
      \ when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa from the\
      \ road to the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who\
      \ came by him stood still. \n"
    13: "¹³ As soon as he was removed from the road, all the men went on after Joab\
      \ to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Now he went on through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, that is, Beth-maacah,
      and all the Berites; and they assembled and went after him as well. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and they built up
      an assault ramp against the city, and it stood against the outer rampart; and
      all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple
      the wall. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen, listen! Please tell
      Joab, ‘Come here that I may speak with you.’” '
    17: '¹⁷ So he approached her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” And he answered,
      “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your slave.” And he said,
      “I am listening.” '
    18: '¹⁸ Then she spoke, saying, “In the past they used to say, ‘They will undoubtedly
      ask advice at Abel,’ and that is how they ended a dispute. '
    19: '¹⁹ I am one of those who are ready for peace and faithful in Israel. You
      are trying to destroy a city, even a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow
      up the inheritance of the Lord?” '
    20: '²⁰ Joab replied, “Far be it, far be it from me that I would consume or destroy! '
    21: '²¹ Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba
      the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against King David. Only turn
      him over, and I will depart from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold,
      his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” '
    22: "²² Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they cut off the head\
      \ of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and\
      \ they were dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to\
      \ the king at Jerusalem. \n"
    23: '²³ Now Joab was in command of the entire army of Israel, and Benaiah the
      son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; '
    24: '²⁴ and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud
      was the secretary; '
    25: '²⁵ and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; '
    26: ²⁶ Ira the Jairite also was a priest to David.
  21:
    1: '¹ Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after
      year; and David sought the presence of the Lord. And the Lord said, “It is because
      of Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.” '
    2: '² So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites
      were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the
      sons of Israel had made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to kill them
      in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah). '
    3: '³ David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And how can I make
      amends, so that you will bless the inheritance of the Lord?” '
    4: '⁴ Then the Gibeonites said to him, “For us it is not a matter of silver or
      gold with Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put anyone to death in Israel.”
      Nevertheless David said, “I will do for you whatever you say.” '
    5: '⁵ So they said to the king, “The man who destroyed us and who planned to eliminate
      us so that we would not exist within any border of Israel— '
    6: "⁶ let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before\
      \ the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the Lord.” And the king said, “I\
      \ will give them.” \n"
    7: '⁷ But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
      because of the oath of the Lord which was between them, between David and Saul’s
      son Jonathan. '
    8: '⁸ So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and
      Mephibosheth whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Merab the daughter
      of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. '
    9: "⁹ Then he handed them over to the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the\
      \ mountain before the Lord, so that the seven of them fell together; and they\
      \ were put to death in the first days of harvest at the beginning of barley\
      \ harvest. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself
      on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until it rained on them from the
      sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor
      the wild animals by night. '
    11: '¹¹ When it was reported to David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
      of Saul, had done, '
    12: '¹² then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan
      from the citizens of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square
      of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines
      struck and killed Saul in Gilboa. '
    13: '¹³ He brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan,
      and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. '
    14: "¹⁴ Then they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the country\
      \ of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of his father Kish; So they did everything\
      \ that the king commanded, and after that God responded to prayer for the land.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now when the Philistines were at war with Israel again, David went down,
      and his servants with him; and when they fought against the Philistines, David
      became weary. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight
      of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, had strapped on
      a new sword, and he intended to kill David. '
    17: "¹⁷ But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and\
      \ killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out again\
      \ with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now it came about after this that there was war again with the Philistines
      at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck and killed Saph, who was among the
      descendants of the giant. '
    19: '¹⁹ And there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son
      of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose
      spear was like a weaver’s beam. '
    20: '²⁰ And there was war at Gath again, where there was a man of great stature
      who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number;
      and he also had been born to the giant. '
    21: '²¹ When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, struck
      and killed him. '
    22: ²² These four were born to the giant at Gath, and they fell by the hand of
      David and by the hand of his servants.
  22:
    1: '¹ Now David spoke the words of this song to the Lord on the day that the Lord
      had saved him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. '
    2: "² He said,\n“The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;\n"
    3: "³ My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge,\nMy shield and the horn of my salvation,\
      \ my stronghold and my refuge;\nMy savior, You save me from violence.\n"
    4: "⁴ I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised,\nAnd I am saved from\
      \ my enemies.\n"
    5: "⁵ For the waves of death encompassed me;\nThe floods of destruction terrified\
      \ me;\n"
    6: "⁶ The ropes of Sheol surrounded me;\nThe snares of death confronted me.\n"
    7: "⁷ In my distress I called upon the Lord,\nYes, I called out to my God;\nAnd\
      \ from His temple He heard my voice,\nAnd my cry for help came into His ears.\n"
    8: "⁸ Then the earth shook and quaked,\nThe foundations of heaven were trembling\n\
      And were shaken, because He was angry.\n"
    9: "⁹ Smoke went up out of His nostrils,\nAnd fire from His mouth was devouring;\n\
      Coals were kindled by it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He also bowed the heavens down low, and came down\nWith thick darkness\
      \ under His feet.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He rode on a cherub and flew;\nHe appeared on the wings of the wind.\n"
    12: "¹² He made darkness canopies around Him,\nA mass of waters, thick clouds\
      \ of the sky.\n"
    13: "¹³ From the brightness before Him\nCoals of fire were kindled.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord thundered from heaven,\nAnd the Most High uttered His voice.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And He shot arrows and scattered them,\nLightning, and routed them.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then the channels of the sea appeared,\nThe foundations of the world were\
      \ exposed\nBy the rebuke of the Lord,\nFrom the blast of the breath of His nostrils.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He sent from on high, He took me;\nHe drew me out of many waters.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ He rescued me from my strong enemy,\nFrom those who hated me, for they\
      \ were too strong for me.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ They confronted me on the day of my disaster,\nBut the Lord was my support.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He also brought me out into an open place;\nHe rescued me, because He\
      \ delighted in me.\n"
    21: "²¹ The Lord has treated me in accordance with my righteousness;\nIn accordance\
      \ with the cleanliness of my hands He has repaid me.\n"
    22: "²² For I have kept the ways of the Lord,\nAnd have not acted wickedly against\
      \ my God.\n"
    23: "²³ For all His ordinances were before me,\nAnd as for His statutes, I did\
      \ not deviate from them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I was also blameless toward Him,\nAnd I have kept myself from my wrongdoing.\n"
    25: "²⁵ So the Lord has repaid me in accordance with my righteousness,\nIn accordance\
      \ with my cleanliness before His eyes.\n"
    26: "²⁶ With the one who is faithful You show Yourself faithful,\nWith the blameless\
      \ one You prove Yourself blameless;\n"
    27: "²⁷ With the one who is pure You show Yourself pure,\nBut with the perverted\
      \ You show Yourself astute.\n"
    28: "²⁸ And You save an afflicted people;\nBut Your eyes are on the haughty whom\
      \ You humiliate.\n"
    29: "²⁹ For You are my lamp, Lord;\nAnd the Lord illuminates my darkness.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For by You I can run at a troop of warriors;\nBy my God I can leap over\
      \ a wall.\n"
    31: "³¹ As for God, His way is blameless;\nThe word of the Lord is refined;\n\
      He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.\n"
    32: "³² For who is God, except the Lord?\nAnd who is a rock, except our God?\n"
    33: "³³ God is my strong fortress;\nAnd He sets the blameless on His way.\n"
    34: "³⁴ He makes my feet like deer’s feet,\nAnd sets me on my high places.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He trains my hands for battle,\nSo that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.\n"
    36: "³⁶ You have also given me the shield of Your salvation,\nAnd Your help makes\
      \ me great.\n"
    37: "³⁷ You enlarge my steps under me,\nAnd my feet have not slipped.\n"
    38: "³⁸ I pursued my enemies and eliminated them,\nAnd I did not turn back until\
      \ they were finished off.\n"
    39: "³⁹ And I have devoured them and smashed them, so that they would not rise;\n\
      And they fell under my feet.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ For You have encircled me with strength for battle;\nYou have forced those\
      \ who rose up against me to bow down under me.\n"
    41: "⁴¹ You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,\nAnd I destroyed\
      \ those who hated me.\n"
    42: "⁴² They looked, but there was no one to save them;\nEven to the Lord, but\
      \ He did not answer them.\n"
    43: "⁴³ Then I pulverized them as the dust of the earth;\nI crushed and trampled\
      \ them like the mud of the streets.\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ You have also saved me from the contentions of my people;\nYou have kept\
      \ me as head of the nations;\nA people I have not known serve me.\n"
    45: "⁴⁵ Foreigners pretend to obey me;\nAs soon as they hear, they obey me.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Foreigners lose heart,\nAnd come trembling out of their fortresses.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ The Lord lives, and blessed be my Rock;\nAnd exalted be my God, the rock\
      \ of my salvation,\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ The God who executes vengeance for me,\nAnd brings down peoples under\
      \ me,\n"
    49: "⁴⁹ Who also brings me out from my enemies;\nYou also raise me above those\
      \ who rise up against me;\nYou rescue me from the violent person.\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Therefore I will give thanks to You, Lord, among the nations,\nAnd I will\
      \ sing praises to Your name.\n"
    51: "⁵¹ He is a tower of salvation to His king,\nAnd shows favor to His anointed,\n\
      To David and his descendants forever.”"
  23:
    1: "¹ Now these are the last words of David.\nDavid the son of Jesse declares,\n\
      The man who was raised on high,\nThe anointed of the God of Jacob\nAnd the sweet\
      \ psalmist of Israel, declares,\n"
    2: "² “The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me,\nAnd His word was on my tongue.\n"
    3: "³ The God of Israel said it;\nThe Rock of Israel spoke to me:\n‘He who rules\
      \ over mankind righteously,\nWho rules in the fear of God,\n"
    4: "⁴ Is like the light of the morning when the sun rises,\nA morning without\
      \ clouds,\nWhen the fresh grass springs out of the earth\nFrom sunshine after\
      \ rain.’\n"
    5: "⁵ Is my house not indeed so with God?\nFor He has made an everlasting covenant\
      \ with me,\nProperly ordered in all things, and secured;\nFor will He not indeed\
      \ make\nAll my salvation and all my delight grow?\n"
    6: "⁶ But the worthless, every one of them, are like scattered thorns,\nBecause\
      \ they cannot be taken in hand;\n"
    7: "⁷ Instead, the man who touches them\nMust be armed with iron and the shaft\
      \ of a spear,\nAnd they will be completely burned with fire in their place.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth,
      a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; he was called Adino the Eznite because
      of eight hundred who were killed by him at one time. '
    9: '⁹ And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three
      mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there
      to battle and the men of Israel had withdrawn. '
    10: "¹⁰ He rose up and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and it\
      \ clung to the sword, and the Lord brought about a great victory that day; and\
      \ the people returned after him only to plunder the dead. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now after him was Shammah the son of Agee, a Hararite. And the Philistines
      were gathered into an army where there was a plot of land full of lentils, and
      the people fled from the Philistines. '
    12: "¹² But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, defended it, and struck\
      \ the Philistines; and the Lord brought about a great victory. \n"
    13: '¹³ Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest
      time to the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camping in
      the Valley of Rephaim. '
    14: '¹⁴ David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines
      was then in Bethlehem. '
    15: '¹⁵ And David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water
      to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!” '
    16: '¹⁶ So the three mighty men forced their way into the camp of the Philistines,
      and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and carried
      it and brought it to David. Yet he would not drink it, but poured it out as
      an offering to the Lord; '
    17: "¹⁷ and he said, “Far be it from me, Lord, that I would do this! Should I\
      \ drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” So he would\
      \ not drink it. These things the three mighty men did. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the
      thirty. And he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had
      a name as well as the three. '
    19: "¹⁹ He was the most honored among the thirty, so he became their commander;\
      \ however, he did not attain to the reputation of the three. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
      who had done great deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went
      down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. '
    21: '²¹ And he killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. Now the Egyptian had a spear
      in his hand, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from
      the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. '
    22: '²² These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name as well as
      the three mighty men. '
    23: "²³ He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain the reputation\
      \ of the three. And David appointed him over his bodyguard. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty; and there was Elhanan
      the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, '
    25: '²⁵ Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, '
    26: '²⁶ Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, '
    27: '²⁷ Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, '
    28: '²⁸ Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, '
    29: '²⁹ Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah
      of the sons of Benjamin, '
    30: '³⁰ Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, '
    31: '³¹ Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, '
    32: '³² Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, '
    33: '³³ Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, '
    34: '³⁴ Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son
      of Ahithophel the Gilonite, '
    35: '³⁵ Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, '
    36: '³⁶ Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, '
    37: '³⁷ Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers of Joab the
      son of Zeruiah, '
    38: '³⁸ Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, '
    39: ³⁹ and Uriah the Hittite; thirty-seven in all.
  24:
    1: '¹ Now the anger of the Lord burned against Israel again, and He incited David
      against them to say, “Go, count Israel and Judah.” '
    2: '² So the king said to Joab the commander of the army, who was with him, “Roam
      about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and conduct
      a census of the people, so that I may know the number of the people.” '
    3: '³ But Joab said to the king, “May the Lord your God add to the people a hundred
      times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king can still see;
      but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?” '
    4: '⁴ Nevertheless, the king’s order prevailed against Joab and against the commanders
      of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army left the presence of the
      king to conduct a census of the people of Israel. '
    5: '⁵ They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the city
      that is in the middle of the Valley of Gad and toward Jazer. '
    6: '⁶ Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came
      to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon, '
    7: '⁷ then they came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites
      and of the Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. '
    8: '⁸ So when they had roamed about through the whole land, they came to Jerusalem
      at the end of nine months and twenty days. '
    9: "⁹ And Joab gave the number of the census of the people to the king: in Israel\
      \ there were eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the\
      \ men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now David’s heart troubled him after he had counted the people. So David
      said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, Lord,
      please overlook the guilt of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” '
    11: '¹¹ When David got up in the morning, the word of the Lord came to Gad the
      prophet, David’s seer, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Go and speak to David, ‘This is what the Lord says: “I am imposing upon
      you three choices; choose for yourself one of them, and I will do it to you.”’” '
    13: '¹³ So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years
      of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee for three months before
      your enemies while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ of plague
      in your land? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent
      me.” '
    14: "¹⁴ Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us now fall into\
      \ the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into\
      \ human hands.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel from the morning until the appointed
      time, and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. '
    16: '¹⁶ When the angel extended his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord
      relented of the disaster and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It
      is enough! Now drop your hand!” And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing
      floor of Araunah the Jebusite. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking down\
      \ the people, and said, “Behold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have\
      \ done wrong; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let Your hand be\
      \ against me and against my father’s house!” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ So Gad came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, erect an altar
      to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” '
    19: '¹⁹ Then David went up in accordance with the word of Gad, just as the Lord
      had commanded. '
    20: '²⁰ And Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over
      toward him; so Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the
      king. '
    21: '²¹ Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And
      David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar
      to the Lord, so that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.” '
    22: '²² Araunah then said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what
      is good in his sight. Look, here are the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing
      sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. '
    23: '²³ Everything, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the
      king, “May the Lord your God be favorable to you.” '
    24: '²⁴ However, the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will certainly buy it from
      you for a price; for I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that
      cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty
      shekels of silver. '
    25: ²⁵ Then David built there an altar to the Lord, and he offered burnt offerings
      and peace offerings. And the Lord responded to prayer for the land, and the
      plague was withdrawn from Israel.
