Zephaniah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah,\
      \ son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of\
      \ Judah: \n"
    2: "² “I will completely remove all things\nFrom the face of the earth,” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ “I will remove human and animal life;\nI will remove the birds of the sky\n\
      And the fish of the sea,\nAnd the ruins along with the wicked;\nAnd I will eliminate\
      \ mankind from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.\n"
    4: "⁴ “So I will stretch out My hand against Judah\nAnd against all the inhabitants\
      \ of Jerusalem.\nAnd I will eliminate the remnant of Baal from this place,\n\
      And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the other priests.\n"
    5: "⁵ And those who bow down on the housetops to the heavenly lights,\nAnd those\
      \ who bow down and swear to the Lord, but also swear by Milcom,\n"
    6: "⁶ And those who have turned back from following the Lord,\nAnd those who have\
      \ not sought the Lord nor inquired of Him.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Be silent before the Lord God!\nFor the day of the Lord is near,\nBecause\
      \ the Lord has prepared a sacrifice,\nHe has consecrated His guests.\n"
    8: "⁸ “Then it will come about on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice\nThat I will\
      \ punish the princes, the king’s sons,\nAnd all who clothe themselves with foreign\
      \ garments.\n"
    9: "⁹ And on that day I will punish all who leap on the temple threshold,\nWho\
      \ fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ And on that day,” declares the Lord,\n“There will be the sound of a cry\
      \ from the Fish Gate,\nWailing from the Second Quarter,\nAnd a loud crash from\
      \ the hills.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Wail, you inhabitants of the Mortar,\nBecause all the people of Canaan\
      \ will be destroyed;\nAll who weigh out silver will be eliminated.\n"
    12: "¹² And it will come about at that time\nThat I will search Jerusalem with\
      \ lamps,\nAnd I will punish the people\nWho are stagnant in spirit,\nWho say\
      \ in their hearts,\n‘The Lord will not do good nor harm!’\n"
    13: "¹³ Their wealth will become plunder,\nAnd their houses desolate;\nYes, they\
      \ will build houses but not inhabit them,\nAnd plant vineyards but not drink\
      \ their wine.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The great day of the Lord is near,\nNear and coming very quickly;\nListen,\
      \ the day of the Lord!\nIn it the warrior cries out bitterly.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ That day is a day of anger,\nA day of trouble and distress,\nA day of\
      \ destruction and desolation,\nA day of darkness and gloom,\nA day of clouds\
      \ and thick darkness,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ A day of trumpet and battle cry\nAgainst the fortified cities\nAnd the\
      \ high corner towers.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I will bring distress on mankind\nSo that they will walk like those who\
      \ are blind,\nBecause they have sinned against the Lord;\nAnd their blood will\
      \ be poured out like dust,\nAnd their flesh like dung.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither their silver nor their gold\nWill be able to save them\nOn the\
      \ day of the Lord’s anger;\nAnd all the earth will be devoured\nBy the fire\
      \ of His jealousy,\nFor He will make a complete end,\nIndeed a horrifying one,\n\
      Of all the inhabitants of the earth."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather yourselves together, yes, join together,\nYou nation without shame,\n"
    2: "² Before the decree takes effect—\nThe day passes like chaff—\nBefore the\
      \ burning anger of the Lord comes upon you,\nBefore the day of the Lord’s anger\
      \ comes upon you.\n"
    3: "³ Seek the Lord,\nAll you humble of the earth\nWho have practiced His ordinances;\n\
      Seek righteousness, seek humility.\nPerhaps you will remain hidden\nOn the day\
      \ of the Lord’s anger. \n"
    4: "⁴ For Gaza will be abandoned,\nAnd Ashkelon will become a desolation;\nThe\
      \ inhabitants of Ashdod will be driven out at noon,\nAnd Ekron will be uprooted.\n"
    5: "⁵ Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast,\nThe nation of the Cherethites!\n\
      The word of the Lord is against you,\nCanaan, land of the Philistines;\nAnd\
      \ I will eliminate you\nSo that there will be no inhabitant.\n"
    6: "⁶ So the seacoast will become grazing places,\nWith pastures for shepherds\
      \ and folds for flocks.\n"
    7: "⁷ And the coast will be\nFor the remnant of the house of Judah,\nThey will\
      \ drive sheep to pasture on it.\nIn the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down\
      \ at evening;\nFor the Lord their God will care for them\nAnd restore their\
      \ fortunes. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I have heard the taunting of Moab\nAnd the abusive speech of the sons of\
      \ Ammon,\nWith which they have taunted My people\nAnd boasted against their\
      \ territory.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord of armies,\nThe God of Israel,\n\
      “Moab will assuredly be like Sodom,\nAnd the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah—\n\
      Ground overgrown with weeds and full of salt mines,\nAnd a permanent desolation.\n\
      The remnant of My people will plunder them,\nAnd the remainder of My nation\
      \ will inherit them.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ This they will have in return for their arrogance, because they have taunted
      and boasted against the people of the Lord of armies. '
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of\
      \ the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone\
      \ from his own place. \n"
    12: "¹² “You also, Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword.”\n"
    13: "¹³ And He will stretch out His hand against the north\nAnd eliminate Assyria,\n\
      And He will make Nineveh a desolation,\nParched like the wilderness.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Flocks will lie down in her midst,\nAll animals that range in herds;\n\
      Both the pelican and the hedgehog\nWill spend their nights in the tops of her\
      \ pillars;\nBirds will sing in the window,\nDevastation will be on the threshold;\n\
      For He has uncovered the cedar work.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is the presumptuous city\nThat dwells securely,\nWho says in her\
      \ heart,\n“I am, and there is no one besides me.”\nHow she has become a desolation,\n\
      A resting place for animals!\nEveryone who passes by her will hiss\nAnd wave\
      \ his hand in contempt."
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,\nThe oppressive city!\n"
    2: "² She obeyed no voice,\nShe accepted no discipline.\nShe did not trust in\
      \ the Lord,\nShe did not approach her God.\n"
    3: "³ Her leaders within her are roaring lions,\nHer judges are wolves at evening;\n\
      They have no bones to gnaw in the morning.\n"
    4: "⁴ Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men;\nHer priests have profaned the\
      \ sanctuary.\nThey have done violence to the Law.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord is righteous within her;\nHe will do no injustice.\nEvery morning\
      \ He brings His justice to light;\nHe does not fail.\nBut the criminal knows\
      \ no shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ “I have eliminated nations;\nTheir corner towers are deserted.\nI have laid\
      \ waste their streets,\nWith no one passing by;\nTheir cities have been laid\
      \ waste,\nWithout a person, without an inhabitant.\n"
    7: "⁷ I said, ‘You will certainly revere Me,\nYou will accept discipline.’\nSo\
      \ her dwelling will not be eliminated\nIn accordance with everything that I\
      \ have stipulated for her.\nInstead, they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Therefore wait for Me,” declares the Lord,\n“For the day when I rise up\
      \ as a witness.\nIndeed, My decision is to gather nations,\nTo assemble kingdoms,\n\
      To pour out on them My indignation,\nAll My burning anger;\nFor all the earth\
      \ will be devoured\nBy the fire of My zeal.\n"
    9: "⁹ For then I will restore to the peoples pure lips,\nSo that all of them may\
      \ call on the name of the Lord,\nTo serve Him shoulder to shoulder.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia\nMy worshipers, My dispersed ones,\n\
      Will bring My offerings.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On that day you will feel no shame\nBecause of all your deeds\nBy which\
      \ you have rebelled against Me;\nFor then I will remove from your midst\nYour\
      \ proud, arrogant ones,\nAnd you will never again be haughty\nOn My holy mountain.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² But I will leave among you\nA humble and lowly people,\nAnd they will\
      \ take refuge in the name of the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ The remnant of Israel will do no wrong\nAnd tell no lies,\nNor will a\
      \ deceitful tongue\nBe found in their mouths;\nFor they will feed and lie down\n\
      With no one to frighten them.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shout for joy, daughter of Zion!\nShout in triumph, Israel!\nRejoice and\
      \ triumph with all your heart,\nDaughter of Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has taken away His judgments against you,\nHe has cleared away\
      \ your enemies.\nThe King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;\nYou will no\
      \ longer fear disaster.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ On that day it will be said to Jerusalem:\n“Do not be afraid, Zion;\n\
      Do not let your hands fall limp.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord your God is in your midst,\nA victorious warrior.\nHe will rejoice\
      \ over you with joy,\nHe will be quiet in His love,\nHe will rejoice over you\
      \ with shouts of joy.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I will gather those who are worried about the appointed feasts—\nThey\
      \ came from you, Zion;\nThe disgrace of exile is a burden on them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, I am going to deal at that time\nWith all your oppressors;\nI\
      \ will save those who limp\nAnd gather the scattered,\nAnd I will turn their\
      \ shame into praise and fame\nIn all the earth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ At that time I will bring you in,\nEven at the time when I gather you\
      \ together;\nIndeed, I will make you famous and praiseworthy\nAmong all the\
      \ peoples of the earth,\nWhen I restore your fortunes before your eyes,”\nSays\
      \ the Lord."
