Joel:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel: \n"
    2: "² Hear this, you elders,\nAnd listen, all inhabitants of the land.\nHas anything\
      \ like this happened in your days,\nOr in your fathers’ days?\n"
    3: "³ Tell your sons about it,\nAnd have your sons tell their sons,\nAnd their\
      \ sons the next generation. \n"
    4: "⁴ What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten;\nAnd what\
      \ the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten;\nAnd what the\
      \ creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.\n"
    5: "⁵ Awake, you heavy drinkers, and weep;\nAnd wail, all you wine drinkers,\n\
      Because of the sweet wine,\nFor it has been eliminated from your mouth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For a nation has invaded my land,\nMighty and without number;\nIts teeth\
      \ are the teeth of a lion,\nAnd it has the jaws of a lioness.\n"
    7: "⁷ It has made my vine a waste\nAnd my fig tree a stump.\nIt has stripped them\
      \ bare and hurled them away;\nTheir branches have become white. \n"
    8: "⁸ Wail like a virgin clothed with sackcloth\nFor the groom of her youth.\n"
    9: "⁹ The grain offering and the drink offering have been cut off\nFrom the house\
      \ of the Lord.\nThe priests mourn,\nThe ministers of the Lord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The field is ruined,\nThe land mourns;\nFor the grain is ruined,\nThe\
      \ new wine has dried up,\nFresh oil has failed.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Be ashamed, you farm workers,\nWail, you vinedressers,\nFor the wheat\
      \ and the barley;\nBecause the harvest of the field is destroyed.\n"
    12: "¹² The vine has dried up\nAnd the fig tree has withered;\nThe pomegranate,\
      \ the palm also, and the apple tree,\nAll the trees of the field have dried\
      \ up.\nIndeed, joy has dried up\nFrom the sons of mankind. \n"
    13: "¹³ Put on sackcloth\nAnd mourn, you priests;\nWail, you ministers of the\
      \ altar!\nCome, spend the night in sackcloth,\nYou ministers of my God,\nFor\
      \ the grain offering and the drink offering\nHave been withheld from the house\
      \ of your God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Consecrate a fast,\nProclaim a solemn assembly;\nGather the elders\nAnd\
      \ all the inhabitants of the land\nTo the house of the Lord your God,\nAnd cry\
      \ out to the Lord.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Woe for the day!\nFor the day of the Lord is near,\nAnd it will come as\
      \ destruction from the Almighty.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Has food not been cut off before our eyes, and\nJoy and rejoicing from\
      \ the house of our God?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seeds have dried up under their shovels;\nThe storehouses have become\
      \ desolate,\nThe grain silos are ruined,\nBecause the grain has dried up.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ How the animals have groaned!\nThe herds of cattle have wandered aimlessly\n\
      Because there is no pasture for them;\nEven the flocks of sheep have suffered.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ To You, Lord, I cry out;\nFor fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,\n\
      And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Even the animals of the field pant for You;\nFor the stream beds of water\
      \ are dried up,\nAnd fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."
  2:
    1: "¹ Blow a trumpet in Zion,\nAnd sound an alarm on My holy mountain!\nLet all\
      \ the inhabitants of the land tremble,\nFor the day of the Lord is coming;\n\
      Indeed, it is near,\n"
    2: "² A day of darkness and gloom,\nA day of clouds and thick darkness.\nAs dawn\
      \ is spread over the mountains,\nSo there is a great and mighty people;\nThere\
      \ has never been anything like it,\nNor will there be again after it\nTo the\
      \ years of many generations.\n"
    3: "³ A fire consumes before them,\nAnd behind them a flame devours.\nThe land\
      \ is like the Garden of Eden before them,\nBut a desolate wilderness behind\
      \ them,\nAnd nothing at all escapes them.\n"
    4: "⁴ Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;\nAnd like war horses,\
      \ so they run.\n"
    5: "⁵ With a noise as of chariots\nThey leap about on the tops of the mountains,\n\
      Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble,\nLike a mighty\
      \ people drawn up for battle.\n"
    6: "⁶ Before them the people are in anguish;\nAll faces turn pale.\n"
    7: "⁷ They run like warriors,\nThey climb the wall like soldiers;\nAnd each of\
      \ them marches in line,\nNor do they lose their way.\n"
    8: "⁸ They do not crowd each other,\nEvery warrior of them marches in his path;\n\
      When they burst through the defenses,\nThey do not break ranks.\n"
    9: "⁹ They storm the city,\nThey run on the wall;\nThey climb into the houses,\n\
      They enter through the windows like a thief.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Before them the earth quakes,\nThe heavens tremble,\nThe sun and the moon\
      \ become dark,\nAnd the stars lose their brightness.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord utters His voice before His army;\nHis camp is indeed very great,\n\
      For mighty is one who carries out His word.\nThe day of the Lord is indeed great\
      \ and very awesome,\nAnd who can endure it?\n"
    12: "¹² “Yet even now,” declares the Lord,\n“Return to Me with all your heart,\n\
      And with fasting, weeping, and mourning;\n"
    13: "¹³ And tear your heart and not merely your garments.”\nNow return to the\
      \ Lord your God,\nFor He is gracious and compassionate,\nSlow to anger, abounding\
      \ in mercy\nAnd relenting of catastrophe.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who knows, He might turn and relent,\nAnd leave a blessing behind Him,\n\
      Resulting in a grain offering and a drink offering\nFor the Lord your God.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Blow a trumpet in Zion,\nConsecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,\nAssemble the elders,\n\
      Gather the children and the nursing infants.\nHave the groom come out of his\
      \ room\nAnd the bride out of her bridal chamber.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Let the priests, the Lord’s ministers,\nWeep between the porch and the\
      \ altar,\nAnd let them say, “Spare Your people, Lord,\nAnd do not make Your\
      \ inheritance a disgrace,\nWith the nations jeering at them.\nWhy should those\
      \ among the peoples say,\n‘Where is their God?’” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Then the Lord will be zealous for His land,\nAnd will have compassion\
      \ for His people.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord will answer and say to His people,\n“Behold, I am going to send\
      \ you grain, new wine, and oil,\nAnd you will be satisfied in full with them;\n\
      And I will never again make you a disgrace among the nations.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But I will remove the northern army far from you,\nAnd I will drive it\
      \ into a dry and desolate land,\nIts advance guard into the eastern sea,\nAnd\
      \ its rear guard into the western sea.\nAnd its stench will ascend and its odor\
      \ of decay will come up,\nBecause it has done great things.” \n"
    21: "²¹ Do not fear, land; shout for joy and rejoice,\nFor the Lord has done great\
      \ things.\n"
    22: "²² Do not fear, animals of the field,\nFor the pastures of the wilderness\
      \ have turned green,\nFor the tree has produced its fruit,\nThe fig tree and\
      \ the vine have yielded in full.\n"
    23: "²³ So shout for joy, you sons of Zion,\nAnd rejoice in the Lord your God;\n\
      For He has given you the early rain for your vindication.\nAnd He has brought\
      \ down for you the rain,\nThe early and latter rain as before.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The threshing floors will be full of grain,\nAnd the vats will overflow\
      \ with the new wine and oil.\n"
    25: "²⁵ “Then I will compensate you for the years\nThat the swarming locust has\
      \ eaten,\nThe creeping locust, the stripping locust, and the gnawing locust—\n\
      My great army which I sent among you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,\nAnd you will praise the\
      \ name of the Lord your God,\nWho has dealt wondrously with you;\nThen My people\
      \ will never be put to shame.\n"
    27: "²⁷ So you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,\nAnd that I am the\
      \ Lord your God\nAnd there is no other;\nAnd My people will never be put to\
      \ shame. \n"
    28: "²⁸ “It will come about after this\nThat I will pour out My Spirit on all\
      \ mankind;\nAnd your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\nYour old men will\
      \ have dreams,\nYour young men will see visions.\n"
    29: "²⁹ And even on the male and female servants\nI will pour out My Spirit in\
      \ those days. \n"
    30: "³⁰ I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth,\nBlood, fire, and\
      \ columns of smoke.\n"
    31: "³¹ The sun will be turned into darkness,\nAnd the moon into blood,\nBefore\
      \ the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.\n"
    32: "³² And it will come about that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord\n\
      Will be saved;\nFor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\nThere will be those who\
      \ escape,\nJust as the Lord has said,\nEven among the survivors whom the Lord\
      \ calls."
  3:
    1: "¹ “For behold, in those days and at that time,\nWhen I restore the fortunes\
      \ of Judah and Jerusalem,\n"
    2: "² I will gather all the nations\nAnd bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.\n\
      Then I will enter into judgment with them there\nOn behalf of My people and\
      \ My inheritance, Israel,\nWhom they have scattered among the nations;\nAnd\
      \ they have divided up My land.\n"
    3: "³ They have also cast lots for My people,\nTraded a boy for a prostitute,\n\
      And sold a girl for wine so that they may drink. \n"
    4: '⁴ Moreover, what are you to Me, Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia?
      Are you repaying Me with retribution? But if you are showing Me retribution,
      swiftly and speedily I will return your retribution on your head! '
    5: '⁵ Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious treasures
      to your temples, '
    6: '⁶ and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove
      them far from their territory, '
    7: '⁷ behold, I am going to stir them up from the place where you have sold them,
      and return your retribution on your head. '
    8: "⁸ I will also sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons\
      \ of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation,” for\
      \ the Lord has spoken. \n"
    9: "⁹ Proclaim this among the nations:\nPrepare for holy war; stir up the warriors!\n\
      Have all the soldiers come forward, have them come up!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Beat your plowshares into swords,\nAnd your pruning hooks into spears;\n\
      Let the weak man say, “I am a warrior.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,\nAnd gather yourselves there.\n\
      Bring down, Lord, Your warriors.\n"
    12: "¹² Let the nations be awakened\nAnd come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,\n\
      For there I will sit to judge\nAll the surrounding nations.\n"
    13: "¹³ Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.\nCome, tread the grapes, for\
      \ the wine press is full;\nThe vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!\nFor the day of the\
      \ Lord is near in the valley of decision.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sun and moon have become dark,\nAnd the stars have lost their brightness.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord roars from Zion\nAnd utters His voice from Jerusalem,\nAnd the\
      \ heavens and the earth quake.\nBut the Lord is a refuge for His people,\nAnd\
      \ a stronghold for the sons of Israel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then you will know that I am the Lord your God,\nDwelling on Zion, My\
      \ holy mountain.\nSo Jerusalem will be holy,\nAnd strangers will no longer pass\
      \ through it. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ And on that day\nThe mountains will drip with sweet wine,\nAnd the hills\
      \ will flow with milk,\nAnd all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;\n\
      And a spring will go out from the house of the Lord\nAnd water the Valley of\
      \ Shittim.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Egypt will become a wasteland,\nAnd Edom will become a desolate wilderness,\n\
      Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah,\nIn whose land they have\
      \ shed innocent blood.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But Judah will be inhabited forever,\nAnd Jerusalem for all generations.\n"
    21: "²¹ And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged,\nFor the Lord\
      \ dwells in Zion."
