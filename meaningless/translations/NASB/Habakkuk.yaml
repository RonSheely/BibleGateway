Habakkuk:
  1:
    1: "¹ The pronouncement which Habakkuk the prophet saw: \n"
    2: "² How long, Lord, have I called for help,\nAnd You do not hear?\nI cry out\
      \ to You, “Violence!”\nYet You do not save.\n"
    3: "³ Why do You make me see disaster,\nAnd make me look at destitution?\nYes,\
      \ devastation and violence are before me;\nStrife exists and contention arises.\n"
    4: "⁴ Therefore the Law is ignored,\nAnd justice is never upheld.\nFor the wicked\
      \ surround the righteous;\nTherefore justice comes out confused. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Look among the nations! Watch!\nBe horrified! Be frightened speechless!\n\
      For I am accomplishing a work in your days—\nYou would not believe it even if\
      \ you were told!\n"
    6: "⁶ For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans,\nThat grim and impetuous people\n\
      Who march throughout the earth,\nTo take possession of dwelling places that\
      \ are not theirs.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are terrifying and feared;\nTheir justice and authority originate with\
      \ themselves.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their horses are faster than leopards,\nAnd quicker than wolves in the evening.\n\
      Their horsemen charge along,\nTheir horsemen come from afar;\nThey fly like\
      \ an eagle swooping down to devour.\n"
    9: "⁹ All of them come for violence.\nTheir horde of faces moves forward.\nThey\
      \ gather captives like sand.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They make fun of kings,\nAnd dignitaries are an object of laughter to\
      \ them.\nThey laugh at every fortress,\nThen heap up dirt and capture it.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Then they fly along like the wind and pass on.\nBut they will be held\
      \ guilty,\nThey whose strength is their god.” \n"
    12: "¹² Are You not from time everlasting,\nLord, my God, my Holy One?\nWe will\
      \ not die.\nYou, Lord, have appointed them to deliver judgment;\nAnd You, O\
      \ Rock, have destined them to punish.\n"
    13: "¹³ Your eyes are too pure to look at evil,\nAnd You cannot look at harm favorably.\n\
      Why do You look favorably\nAt those who deal treacherously?\nWhy are You silent\
      \ when the wicked swallow up\nThose more righteous than they?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Why have You made people like the fish of the sea,\nLike crawling things\
      \ that have no ruler over them?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook,\nDrag them away with their\
      \ net,\nAnd gather them together in their fishing net.\nTherefore they rejoice\
      \ and are joyful.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net\nAnd burn incense to their\
      \ fishing net,\nBecause through these things their catch is large,\nAnd their\
      \ food is plentiful.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Will they therefore empty their net,\nAnd continually slay nations without\
      \ sparing?"
  2:
    1: "¹ I will stand at my guard post\nAnd station myself on the watchtower;\nAnd\
      \ I will keep watch to see what He will say to me,\nAnd how I may reply when\
      \ I am reprimanded.\n"
    2: "² Then the Lord answered me and said,\n“Write down the vision\nAnd inscribe\
      \ it clearly on tablets,\nSo that one who reads it may run.\n"
    3: "³ For the vision is yet for the appointed time;\nIt hurries toward the goal\
      \ and it will not fail.\nThough it delays, wait for it;\nFor it will certainly\
      \ come, it will not delay long. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Behold, as for the impudent one,\nHis soul is not right within him;\nBut\
      \ the righteous one will live by his faith.\n"
    5: "⁵ Furthermore, wine betrays an arrogant man,\nSo that he does not achieve\
      \ his objective.\nHe enlarges his appetite like Sheol,\nAnd he is like death,\
      \ never satisfied.\nHe also gathers to himself all the nations\nAnd collects\
      \ to himself all the peoples. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Will all of these not take up a song of ridicule against him,\nEven a saying\
      \ and insinuations against him\nAnd say, ‘Woe to him who increases what is not\
      \ his—\nFor how long—\nAnd makes himself rich with debts!’\n"
    7: "⁷ Will your creditors not rise up suddenly,\nAnd those who collect from you\
      \ awaken?\nIndeed, you will become plunder for them.\n"
    8: "⁸ Since you have looted many nations,\nAll the rest of the peoples will loot\
      \ you—\nBecause of human bloodshed and violence done to the land,\nTo the town\
      \ and all its inhabitants. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Woe to him who makes evil profit for his household,\nTo put his nest on\
      \ high,\nTo be saved from the hand of catastrophe!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You have planned a shameful thing for your house\nBy bringing many peoples\
      \ to an end;\nSo you are sinning against yourself.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the stone will cry out from the wall,\nAnd the rafter will answer\
      \ it from the framework. \n"
    12: "¹² “Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed,\nAnd founds a town with\
      \ violence!\n"
    13: "¹³ Is it not indeed from the Lord of armies\nThat peoples labor merely for\
      \ fire,\nAnd nations become weary for nothing?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For the earth will be filled\nWith the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\n\
      As the waters cover the sea. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink;\nTo you who mix in your venom\
      \ even to make your neighbors drunk,\nSo as to look at their genitalia!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor.\nDrink, you yourself,\
      \ and expose your own foreskin!\nThe cup in the Lord’s right hand will come\
      \ around to you,\nAnd utter disgrace will come upon your glory.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,\nAnd the devastation\
      \ of its animals by which you terrified them,\nBecause of human bloodshed and\
      \ violence done to the land,\nTo the town and all its inhabitants. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “What benefit is a carved image when its maker has carved it,\nOr a cast\
      \ metal image, a teacher of falsehood?\nFor its maker trusts in his own handiwork\n\
      When he fashions speechless idols.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Woe to him who says to a piece of wood, ‘Awake!’\nTo a mute stone, ‘Arise!’\n\
      That is your teacher?\nBehold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,\nYet there\
      \ is no breath at all inside it.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But the Lord is in His holy temple.\nLet all the earth be silent before\
      \ Him.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth. \n"
    2: "² Lord, I have heard the report about You, and I was afraid.\nLord, revive\
      \ Your work in the midst of the years,\nIn the midst of the years make it known.\n\
      In anger remember mercy. \n"
    3: "³ God comes from Teman,\nAnd the Holy One from Mount Paran. \nHis splendor\
      \ covers the heavens,\nAnd the earth is full of His praise.\n"
    4: "⁴ His radiance is like the sunlight;\nHe has rays flashing from His hand,\n\
      And the hiding of His might is there.\n"
    5: "⁵ Before Him goes plague,\nAnd plague comes forth after Him.\n"
    6: "⁶ He stood and caused the earth to shudder;\nHe looked and caused the nations\
      \ to jump.\nYes, the everlasting mountains were shattered,\nThe ancient hills\
      \ collapsed.\nHis paths are everlasting.\n"
    7: "⁷ I saw the tents of Cushan under distress,\nThe tent curtains of the land\
      \ of Midian were trembling. \n"
    8: "⁸ Did the Lord rage against the rivers,\nOr was Your anger against the rivers,\n\
      Or was Your rage against the sea,\nThat You rode on Your horses,\nOn Your chariots\
      \ of salvation?\n"
    9: "⁹ You removed Your bow from its holder,\nThe arrows of Your word were sworn.\
      \ \nYou divided the earth with rivers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The mountains saw You and quaked;\nThe downpour of waters swept by.\n\
      The deep raised its voice,\nIt lifted high its hands.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Sun and moon stood in their lofty places;\nThey went away at the light\
      \ of Your arrows,\nAt the radiance of Your flashing spear.\n"
    12: "¹² In indignation You marched through the earth;\nIn anger You trampled the\
      \ nations.\n"
    13: "¹³ You went forth for the salvation of Your people,\nFor the salvation of\
      \ Your anointed.\nYou smashed the head of the house of evil\nTo uncover him\
      \ from foot to neck. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ You pierced with his own arrows\nThe head of his leaders.\nThey stormed\
      \ in to scatter us;\nTheir arrogance was like those\nWho devour the oppressed\
      \ in secret.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You trampled on the sea with Your horses,\nOn the foam of many waters.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ I heard, and my inner parts trembled;\nAt the sound, my lips quivered.\n\
      Decay enters my bones,\nAnd in my place I tremble;\nBecause I must wait quietly\
      \ for the day of distress,\nFor the people to arise who will attack us.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Even if the fig tree does not blossom,\nAnd there is no fruit on the vines,\n\
      If the yield of the olive fails,\nAnd the fields produce no food,\nEven if the\
      \ flock disappears from the fold,\nAnd there are no cattle in the stalls,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Yet I will triumph in the Lord,\nI will rejoice in the God of my salvation.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The Lord God is my strength,\nAnd He has made my feet like deer’s feet,\n\
      And has me walk on my high places.\nFor the choir director, on my stringed instruments."
