Ephesians:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,\nTo the saints who\
      \ are at Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus: "
    2: "² Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    3: '³ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
      us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, '
    4: '⁴ just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would
      be holy and blameless before Him. In love '
    5: '⁵ He predestined us to adoption as sons and daughters through Jesus Christ
      to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, '
    6: '⁶ to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He favored us in the
      Beloved. '
    7: '⁷ In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our wrongdoings,
      according to the riches of His grace '
    8: '⁸ which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight '
    9: '⁹ He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure
      which He set forth in Him, '
    10: '¹⁰ regarding His plan of the fullness of the times, to bring all things together
      in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. '
    11: '¹¹ In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according
      to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His
      will, '
    12: '¹² to the end that we who were the first to hope in the Christ would be to
      the praise of His glory. '
    13: '¹³ In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel
      of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy
      Spirit of the promise, '
    14: "¹⁴ who is a first installment of our inheritance, in regard to the redemption\
      \ of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which
      exists among you and your love for all the saints, '
    16: '¹⁶ do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my
      prayers; '
    17: '¹⁷ that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you
      a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. '
    18: '¹⁸ I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will
      know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His
      inheritance in the saints, '
    19: '¹⁹ and what is the boundless greatness of His power toward us who believe.
      These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might '
    20: '²⁰ which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and
      seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, '
    21: '²¹ far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name
      that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. '
    22: '²² And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and made Him head
      over all things to the church, '
    23: ²³ which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
  2:
    1: '¹ And you were dead in your offenses and sins, '
    2: '² in which you previously walked according to the course of this world, according
      to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in
      the sons of disobedience. '
    3: '³ Among them we too all previously lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging
      the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath,
      just as the rest. '
    4: '⁴ But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved
      us, '
    5: '⁵ even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, made us alive together with Christ
      (by grace you have been saved), '
    6: '⁶ and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places
      in Christ Jesus, '
    7: '⁷ so that in the ages to come He might show the boundless riches of His grace
      in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. '
    8: '⁸ For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves,
      it is the gift of God; '
    9: '⁹ not a result of works, so that no one may boast. '
    10: "¹⁰ For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which\
      \ God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Therefore remember that previously you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who
      are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision” which is performed
      in the flesh by human hands— '
    12: '¹² remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from
      the people of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having
      no hope and without God in the world. '
    13: '¹³ But now in Christ Jesus you who previously were far away have been brought
      near by the blood of Christ. '
    14: '¹⁴ For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down
      the barrier of the dividing wall, '
    15: '¹⁵ by abolishing in His flesh the hostility, which is the Law composed of
      commandments expressed in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two
      one new person, in this way establishing peace; '
    16: '¹⁶ and that He might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross,
      by it having put to death the hostility. '
    17: '¹⁷ And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to
      those who were near; '
    18: '¹⁸ for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. '
    19: '¹⁹ So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow
      citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, '
    20: '²⁰ having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ
      Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, '
    21: '²¹ in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy
      temple in the Lord, '
    22: ²² in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the
      Spirit.
  3:
    1: '¹ For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you
      Gentiles— '
    2: '² if indeed you have heard of the administration of God’s grace which was
      given to me for you; '
    3: '³ that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before
      briefly. '
    4: '⁴ By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the
      mystery of Christ, '
    5: '⁵ which in other generations was not made known to mankind, as it has now
      been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; '
    6: '⁶ to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of
      the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, '
    7: '⁷ of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which
      was given to me according to the working of His power. '
    8: '⁸ To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to
      the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, '
    9: '⁹ and to enlighten all people as to what the plan of the mystery is which
      for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things; '
    10: '¹⁰ so that the multifaceted wisdom of God might now be made known through
      the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places. '
    11: '¹¹ This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in
      Christ Jesus our Lord, '
    12: '¹² in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him. '
    13: "¹³ Therefore I ask you not to become discouraged about my tribulations in\
      \ your behalf, since they are your glory. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ For this reason I bend my knees before the Father, '
    15: '¹⁵ from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, '
    16: '¹⁶ that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened
      with power through His Spirit in the inner self, '
    17: '¹⁷ so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being
      rooted and grounded in love, '
    18: '¹⁸ may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length
      and height and depth, '
    19: "¹⁹ and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may\
      \ be filled to all the fullness of God. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask
      or think, according to the power that works within us, '
    21: ²¹ to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations
      forever and ever. Amen.
  4:
    1: '¹ Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy
      of the calling with which you have been called, '
    2: '² with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another
      in love, '
    3: '³ being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. '
    4: '⁴ There is one body and one Spirit, just as you also were called in one hope
      of your calling; '
    5: '⁵ one Lord, one faith, one baptism, '
    6: "⁶ one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. \n"
    7: '⁷ But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s
      gift. '
    8: "⁸ Therefore it says,\n“When He ascended on high,\nHe led captive the captives,\n\
      And He gave gifts to people.” \n"
    9: '⁹ (Now this expression, “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also
      had descended into the lower parts of the earth? '
    10: '¹⁰ He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens,
      so that He might fill all things.) '
    11: '¹¹ And He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some
      as pastors and teachers, '
    12: '¹² for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building
      up of the body of Christ; '
    13: '¹³ until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
      the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs
      to the fullness of Christ. '
    14: '¹⁴ As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by
      waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of people,
      by craftiness in deceitful scheming; '
    15: '¹⁵ but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into
      Him who is the head, that is, Christ, '
    16: "¹⁶ from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every\
      \ joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes\
      \ the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So I say this, and affirm in the Lord, that you are to no longer walk
      just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their minds, '
    18: '¹⁸ being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because
      of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; '
    19: '¹⁹ and they, having become callous, have given themselves up to indecent
      behavior for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. '
    20: '²⁰ But you did not learn Christ in this way, '
    21: '²¹ if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth
      is in Jesus, '
    22: '²² that, in reference to your former way of life, you are to rid yourselves
      of the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, '
    23: '²³ and that you are to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, '
    24: "²⁴ and to put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created\
      \ in righteousness and holiness of the truth. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Therefore, ridding yourselves of falsehood, speak truth each one of you
      with his neighbor, because we are parts of one another. '
    26: '²⁶ Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, '
    27: '²⁷ and do not give the devil an opportunity. '
    28: '²⁸ The one who steals must no longer steal; but rather he must labor, producing
      with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with
      the one who has need. '
    29: '²⁹ Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good
      word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that
      it will give grace to those who hear. '
    30: '³⁰ Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the
      day of redemption. '
    31: '³¹ All bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander must be removed from
      you, along with all malice. '
    32: ³² Be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving each other, just as God
      in Christ also has forgiven you.
  5:
    1: '¹ Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; '
    2: "² and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for\
      \ us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. \n"
    3: '³ But sexual immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be mentioned
      among you, as is proper among saints; '
    4: '⁴ and there must be no filthiness or foolish talk, or vulgar joking, which
      are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. '
    5: "⁵ For this you know with certainty, that no sexually immoral or impure or\
      \ greedy person, which amounts to an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom\
      \ of Christ and God. \n"
    6: '⁶ See that no one deceives you with empty words, for because of these things
      the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. '
    7: '⁷ Therefore do not become partners with them; '
    8: '⁸ for you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children
      of light '
    9: '⁹ (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and
      truth), '
    10: '¹⁰ as you try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not participate in the useless deeds of darkness, but instead even
      expose them; '
    12: '¹² for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them
      in secret. '
    13: '¹³ But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for
      everything that becomes visible is light. '
    14: "¹⁴ For this reason it says,\n“Awake, sleeper,\nAnd arise from the dead,\n\
      And Christ will shine on you.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ So then, be careful how you walk, not as unwise people but as wise, '
    16: '¹⁶ making the most of your time, because the days are evil. '
    17: '¹⁷ Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord
      is. '
    18: '¹⁸ And do not get drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery, but be filled
      with the Spirit, '
    19: '¹⁹ speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
      and making melody with your hearts to the Lord; '
    20: '²⁰ always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
      to our God and Father; '
    21: "²¹ and subject yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ. \n"
    22: '²² Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord. '
    23: '²³ For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of
      the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. '
    24: "²⁴ But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be\
      \ to their husbands in everything. \n"
    25: '²⁵ Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave
      Himself up for her, '
    26: '²⁶ so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water
      with the word, '
    27: '²⁷ that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no
      spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. '
    28: '²⁸ So husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He
      who loves his own wife loves himself; '
    29: '²⁹ for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just
      as Christ also does the church, '
    30: '³⁰ because we are parts of His body. '
    31: '³¹ For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined
      to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. '
    32: '³² This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and
      the church. '
    33: ³³ Nevertheless, as for you individually, each husband is to love his own
      wife the same as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
      husband.
  6:
    1: '¹ Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. '
    2: '² Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), '
    3: "³ so that it may turn out well for you, and that you may live long on the\
      \ earth. \n"
    4: "⁴ Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the\
      \ discipline and instruction of the Lord. \n"
    5: '⁵ Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh,
      with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; '
    6: '⁶ not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ,
      doing the will of God from the heart. '
    7: '⁷ With goodwill render service, as to the Lord, and not to people, '
    8: "⁸ knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive this back\
      \ from the Lord, whether slave or free. \n"
    9: "⁹ And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing\
      \ that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality\
      \ with Him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. '
    11: '¹¹ Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against
      the schemes of the devil. '
    12: '¹² For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers,
      against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual
      forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. '
    13: '¹³ Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to
      resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. '
    14: '¹⁴ Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having
      put on the breastplate of righteousness, '
    15: '¹⁵ and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace; '
    16: '¹⁶ in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will
      be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. '
    17: "¹⁷ And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is\
      \ the word of God. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with
      this in view, be alert with all perseverance and every request for all the saints, '
    19: '¹⁹ and pray in my behalf, that speech may be given to me in the opening of
      my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, '
    20: "²⁰ for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak\
      \ boldly, as I ought to speak. \n"
    21: '²¹ Now, so that you also may know about my circumstances as to what I am
      doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will
      make everything known to you. '
    22: "²² I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about\
      \ us, and that he may comfort your hearts. \n"
    23: '²³ Peace be to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the
      Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. '
    24: ²⁴ Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible
      love.
