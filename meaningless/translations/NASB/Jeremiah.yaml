Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth
      in the land of Benjamin, '
    2: '² to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon,
      king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. '
    3: "³ It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,\
      \ until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of\
      \ Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month. \n"
    4: "⁴ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n"
    5: "⁵ “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nAnd before you were born I\
      \ consecrated you;\nI have appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”\n"
    6: "⁶ Then I said, “Oh, Lord God!\nBehold, I do not know how to speak,\nBecause\
      \ I am a youth.”\n"
    7: "⁷ But the Lord said to me,\n“Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’\nBecause everywhere\
      \ I send you, you shall go,\nAnd all that I command you, you shall speak.\n"
    8: "⁸ Do not be afraid of them,\nFor I am with you to save you,” declares the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord stretched out His hand and touched my mouth, and the Lord\
      \ said to me,\n“Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ See, I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms,\n\
      To root out and to tear down,\nTo destroy and to overthrow,\nTo build and to\
      \ plant.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”
      And I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” '
    12: "¹² Then the Lord said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over\
      \ My word to perform it.” \n"
    13: '¹³ And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, “What do you
      see?” And I said, “I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north.” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to me, “Out of the north the evil will be unleashed
      on all the inhabitants of the land. '
    15: '¹⁵ For, behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north,”
      declares the Lord; “and they will come and place, each one of them, his throne
      at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around,
      and against all the cities of Judah. '
    16: '¹⁶ And I will pronounce My judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,
      since they have abandoned Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and
      worshiped the works of their own hands. '
    17: '¹⁷ Now, belt your garment around your waist and arise, and speak to them
      all that I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, or I will make you dismayed
      before them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Now behold, I have made you today like a fortified city and like a pillar
      of iron and walls of bronze against the whole land, to the kings of Judah, to
      its leaders, to its priests, and to the people of the land. '
    19: ¹⁹ And they will fight against you but they will not overcome you, for I am
      with you to save you,” declares the Lord.
  2:
    1: '¹ Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    2: "² “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘This is what the Lord\
      \ says:\n“I remember regarding you the devotion of your youth,\nYour love when\
      \ you were a bride,\nYour following after Me in the wilderness,\nThrough a land\
      \ not sown.\n"
    3: "³ Israel was holy to the Lord,\nThe first of His harvest.\nAll who ate of\
      \ it became guilty;\nEvil came upon them,” declares the Lord.’” \n"
    4: '⁴ Hear the word of the Lord, house of Jacob, and all the families of the house
      of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“What injustice did your fathers find in Me,\n\
      That they went far from Me,\nAnd walked after emptiness and became empty?\n"
    6: "⁶ They did not say, ‘Where is the Lord\nWho brought us up out of the land\
      \ of Egypt,\nWho led us through the wilderness,\nThrough a land of deserts and\
      \ of pits,\nThrough a land of drought and of deep darkness,\nThrough a land\
      \ that no one crossed\nAnd where no person lived?’\n"
    7: "⁷ I brought you into the fruitful land\nTo eat its fruit and its good things.\n\
      But you came and defiled My land,\nAnd you made My inheritance an abomination.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’\nAnd those who handle the\
      \ Law did not know Me;\nThe rulers also revolted against Me,\nAnd the prophets\
      \ prophesied by Baal\nAnd walked after things that were of no benefit. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I will still contend with you,” declares the Lord,\n“And I will\
      \ contend with your sons’ sons.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For cross to the coastlands of Kittim and see,\nAnd send to Kedar and\
      \ observe closely,\nAnd see if there has been anything like this!\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has a nation changed gods,\nWhen they were not gods?\nBut My people have\
      \ exchanged their glory\nFor that which is of no benefit.\n"
    12: "¹² Be appalled at this, you heavens,\nAnd shudder, be very desolate,” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ “For My people have committed two evils:\nThey have abandoned Me,\nThe\
      \ fountain of living waters,\nTo carve out for themselves cisterns,\nBroken\
      \ cisterns\nThat do not hold water. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Is Israel a slave? Or is he a servant born in the home?\nWhy has he become\
      \ plunder?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The young lions have roared at him,\nThey have roared loudly.\nAnd they\
      \ have made his land a waste;\nHis cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\nHave shaved your head.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Have you not done this to yourself\nBy your abandoning the Lord your God\n\
      When He led you in the way?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt,\nExcept to drink the\
      \ waters of the Nile?\nOr what are you doing on the road to Assyria,\nExcept\
      \ to drink the waters of the Euphrates River?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your own wickedness will correct you,\nAnd your apostasies will punish\
      \ you;\nKnow therefore and see that it is evil and bitter\nFor you to abandon\
      \ the Lord your God,\nAnd the fear of Me is not in you,” declares the Lord God\
      \ of armies. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “For long ago I broke your yoke\nAnd tore off your restraints;\nBut you\
      \ said, ‘I will not serve!’\nFor on every high hill\nAnd under every leafy tree\n\
      You have lain down as a prostitute.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet I planted you as a choice vine,\nA completely faithful seed.\nHow\
      \ then have you turned yourself before Me\nInto the degenerate shoots of a foreign\
      \ vine?\n"
    22: "²² Although you wash yourself with lye\nAnd use much soap,\nThe stain of\
      \ your guilt is before Me,” declares the Lord God.\n"
    23: "²³ “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled,\nI have not gone after the Baals’?\n\
      Look at your way in the valley!\nKnow what you have done!\nYou are a swift young\
      \ camel running about senselessly on her ways,\n"
    24: "²⁴ A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness,\nThat sniffs the wind in her\
      \ passion.\nWho can turn her away in her mating season?\nNone who seek her will\
      \ grow weary;\nIn her month they will find her.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Keep your feet from being bare,\nAnd your throat from thirst;\nBut you\
      \ said, ‘It is hopeless!\nNo! For I have loved strangers,\nAnd I will walk after\
      \ them.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “Like the shame of a thief when he is discovered,\nSo the house of Israel\
      \ is shamed;\nThey, their kings, their leaders,\nTheir priests, and their prophets,\n"
    27: "²⁷ Who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’\nAnd to a stone, ‘You gave me\
      \ birth.’\nFor they have turned their backs to Me,\nAnd not their faces;\nBut\
      \ in the time of their trouble they will say,\n‘Arise and save us!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ But where are your gods\nWhich you made for yourself?\nLet them arise,\
      \ if they can save you\nIn the time of your trouble!\nFor as many as the number\
      \ of your cities\nAre your gods, Judah. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Why do you contend with Me?\nYou have all revolted against Me,” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    30: "³⁰ “In vain I have struck your sons;\nThey did not accept discipline.\nYour\
      \ sword has devoured your prophets\nLike a destroying lion.\n"
    31: "³¹ You generation, look to the word of the Lord.\nHave I been a wilderness\
      \ to Israel,\nOr a land of thick darkness?\nWhy do My people say, ‘We are free\
      \ to roam;\nWe will no longer come to You’?\n"
    32: "³² Can a virgin forget her jewelry,\nOr a bride her attire?\nYet My people\
      \ have forgotten Me\nFor days without number.\n"
    33: "³³ How well you prepare your way\nTo seek love!\nTherefore even to the wicked\
      \ women\nYou have taught your ways.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Also on your skirts is found\nThe lifeblood of the innocent poor;\nYou\
      \ did not find them breaking in.\nBut in spite of all these things,\n"
    35: "³⁵ You said, ‘I am innocent;\nSurely His anger is turned away from me.’\n\
      Behold, I will enter into judgment with you\nBecause you say, ‘I have not sinned.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ Why do you go around so much\nChanging your way?\nAlso, you will be put\
      \ to shame by Egypt,\nJust as you were put to shame by Assyria.\n"
    37: "³⁷ From this place as well you will go out\nWith your hands on your head;\n\
      For the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust,\nAnd you will not prosper\
      \ with them.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ God says, “If a husband divorces his wife\nAnd she leaves him\nAnd becomes\
      \ another man’s wife,\nWill he return to her again?\nWould that land not be\
      \ completely defiled?\nBut you are a prostitute with many lovers;\nYet you turn\
      \ to Me,” declares the Lord.\n"
    2: "² “Raise your eyes to the bare heights and see;\nWhere have you not been violated?\n\
      You have sat for them by the roads\nLike an Arab in the desert,\nAnd you have\
      \ defiled a land\nWith your prostitution and your wickedness.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the showers have been withheld,\nAnd there has been no spring\
      \ rain.\nYet you had a prostitute’s forehead;\nYou refused to be ashamed.\n"
    4: "⁴ Have you not just now called to Me,\n‘My Father, You are the friend of my\
      \ youth?\n"
    5: "⁵ Will He be angry forever,\nOr keep His anger to the end?’\nBehold, you have\
      \ spoken\nAnd have done evil things,\nAnd you have had your own way.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the Lord said to me in the days of King Josiah, “Have you seen what
      faithless Israel did? She went up on every high hill and under every leafy tree,
      and she prostituted herself there. '
    7: '⁷ Yet I thought, ‘After she has done all these things she will return to Me’;
      but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. '
    8: '⁸ And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her
      away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah
      did not fear; but she went and prostituted herself also. '
    9: '⁹ And because of the thoughtlessness of her prostitution, she defiled the
      land and committed adultery with stones and trees. '
    10: "¹⁰ Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to\
      \ Me with all her heart, but rather in deception,” declares the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ And the Lord said to me, “Faithless Israel has proved herself to be more
      righteous than treacherous Judah. '
    12: "¹² Go and proclaim these words toward the north and say,\n‘Return, faithless\
      \ Israel,’ declares the Lord;\n‘I will not look at you in anger.\nFor I am gracious,’\
      \ declares the Lord;\n‘I will not be angry forever.\n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge your wrongdoing,\nThat you have revolted against the\
      \ Lord your God,\nAnd have scattered your favors to the strangers under every\
      \ leafy tree,\nAnd you have not obeyed My voice,’ declares the Lord.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ ‘Return, you faithless sons,’ declares the Lord;\n‘For I am a master to\
      \ you,\nAnd I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,\nAnd bring\
      \ you to Zion.’ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you
      knowledge and understanding. '
    16: '¹⁶ And it shall be in those days when you become numerous and are fruitful
      in the land,” declares the Lord, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant
      of the Lord.’ And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor miss
      it, nor will it be made again. '
    17: '¹⁷ At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of the Lord,’ and all
      the nations will assemble at it, at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord; and
      they will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil heart. '
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and\
      \ they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave\
      \ your fathers as an inheritance. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Then I said,\n‘How I would set you among My sons\nAnd give you a pleasant\
      \ land,\nThe most beautiful inheritance of the nations!’\nAnd I said, ‘You shall\
      \ call Me, My Father,\nAnd not turn away from following Me.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ However, as a woman treacherously leaves her lover,\nSo you have dealt\
      \ treacherously with Me,\nHouse of Israel,” declares the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ A voice is heard on the bare heights,\nThe weeping, the pleading of the\
      \ sons of Israel.\nBecause they have perverted their way,\nThey have forgotten\
      \ the Lord their God.\n"
    22: "²² “Return, you faithless sons,\nI will heal your faithlessness.”\n“Behold,\
      \ we come to You;\nFor You are the Lord our God.\n"
    23: "²³ Certainly the hills are a deception,\nCommotion on the mountains.\nCertainly\
      \ in the Lord our God\nIs the salvation of Israel. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “But the shame has consumed the product of our fathers’ labor since our
      youth—their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. '
    25: ²⁵ Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we
      have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even
      to this day. And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”
  4:
    1: "¹ “If you will return, Israel,” declares the Lord,\n“Then you should return\
      \ to Me.\nAnd if you will put away your detestable things from My presence,\n\
      And will not waver,\n"
    2: "² And if you will swear, ‘As the Lord lives,’\nIn truth, in justice, and in\
      \ righteousness;\nThen the nations will bless themselves in Him,\nAnd in Him\
      \ they will boast.” \n"
    3: "³ For this is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem:\n“Break\
      \ up your uncultivated ground,\nAnd do not sow among thorns.\n"
    4: "⁴ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord\nAnd remove the foreskins of your hearts,\n\
      Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nOr else My wrath will spread like\
      \ fire\nAnd burn with no one to quench it,\nBecause of the evil of your deeds.”\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,\n“Blow the trumpet\
      \ in the land;\nCry aloud and say,\n‘Assemble, and let’s go\nInto the fortified\
      \ cities.’\n"
    6: "⁶ Raise a flag toward Zion!\nTake refuge, do not stand still,\nFor I am bringing\
      \ evil from the north,\nAnd great destruction.\n"
    7: "⁷ A lion has gone up from his thicket,\nAnd a destroyer of nations has set\
      \ out;\nHe has gone out from his place\nTo make your land a waste.\nYour cities\
      \ will be ruins,\nWithout an inhabitant.\n"
    8: "⁸ For this, put on sackcloth,\nMourn and wail;\nFor the fierce anger of the\
      \ Lord\nHas not turned away from us.” \n"
    9: "⁹ “And it shall come about on that day,” declares the Lord, “that the heart\
      \ of the king and the hearts of the leaders will fail; and the priests will\
      \ tremble, and the prophets will be astonished.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “Oh, Lord God! Surely You have utterly deceived this people\
      \ and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace’; yet a sword touches the throat.”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching
      wind from the bare heights in the wilderness, in the direction of the daughter
      of My people—not to winnow and not to cleanse, '
    12: "¹² a wind too strong for this—will come at My command; now I will also pronounce\
      \ judgments against them.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Behold, he goes up like clouds,\nAnd his chariots like the whirlwind;\n\
      His horses are swifter than eagles.\nWoe to us, for we are ruined!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Wash your heart from evil, Jerusalem,\nSo that you may be saved.\nHow\
      \ long will your wicked thoughts\nLodge within you?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For a voice declares from Dan,\nAnd proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Report it to the nations, now!\nProclaim to Jerusalem,\n‘Enemies are\
      \ coming from a remote country,\nAnd they raise their voices against the cities\
      \ of Judah.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Like watchmen of a field they are against her all around,\nBecause she\
      \ has rebelled against Me,’ declares the Lord.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Your ways and your deeds\nHave brought these things upon you.\nThis is\
      \ your evil. How bitter!\nHow it has touched your heart!” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart!\nMy heart is pounding\
      \ in me;\nI cannot keep silent,\nBecause, my soul, you have heard\nThe sound\
      \ of the trumpet,\nThe alarm of war.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Disaster upon disaster is proclaimed,\nFor the whole land is devastated;\n\
      Suddenly my tents are devastated,\nAnd my curtains in an instant.\n"
    21: "²¹ How long must I see the flag\nAnd hear the sound of the trumpet?\n"
    22: "²² “For My people are foolish,\nThey do not know Me;\nThey are foolish children\n\
      And have no understanding.\nThey are skillful at doing evil,\nBut they do not\
      \ know how to do good.” \n"
    23: "²³ I looked at the earth, and behold, it was a formless and desolate emptiness;\n\
      And to the heavens, and they had no light.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,\nAnd all the\
      \ hills jolted back and forth.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I looked, and behold, there was no human,\nAnd all the birds of the sky\
      \ had fled.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness,\nAnd all its\
      \ cities were pulled down\nBefore the Lord, before His fierce anger. \n"
    27: "²⁷ For this is what the Lord says:\n“The whole land shall be a desolation,\n\
      Yet I will not execute a complete destruction.\n"
    28: "²⁸ For this the earth will mourn,\nAnd the heavens above will become dark,\n\
      Because I have spoken, I have purposed,\nAnd I have not changed My mind, nor\
      \ will I turn from it.”\n"
    29: "²⁹ At the sound of the horseman and archer every city flees;\nThey go into\
      \ the thickets and climb among the rocks;\nEvery city is abandoned,\nAnd no\
      \ one lives in them.\n"
    30: "³⁰ And you, desolate one, what will you do?\nAlthough you dress in scarlet,\n\
      Although you adorn yourself with jewelry of gold,\nAlthough you enlarge your\
      \ eyes with makeup,\nIn vain you make yourself beautiful.\nYour lovers despise\
      \ you;\nThey seek your life.\n"
    31: "³¹ For I heard a voice cry as of a woman in labor,\nThe anguish as of one\
      \ giving birth to her first child.\nThe voice of the daughter of Zion gasping\
      \ for breath,\nStretching out her hands, saying,\n“Ah, woe to me, for I faint\
      \ before murderers.”"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem,\nAnd look and take notice.\n\
      And seek in her public squares,\nIf you can find a person,\nIf there is one\
      \ who does justice, who seeks honesty,\nThen I will forgive her.\n"
    2: "² And although they say, ‘As the Lord lives,’\nCertainly they swear falsely.”\n"
    3: "³ Lord, do Your eyes not look for honesty?\nYou have struck them,\nBut they\
      \ did not weaken;\nYou have consumed them,\nBut they refused to accept discipline.\n\
      They have made their faces harder than rock;\nThey have refused to repent. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then I said, “They are only the poor,\nThey are foolish;\nFor they do not\
      \ know the way of the Lord\nOr the judgment of their God.\n"
    5: "⁵ I will go to the great\nAnd speak to them,\nFor they know the way of the\
      \ Lord\nAnd the judgment of their God.”\nBut together they too have broken the\
      \ yoke\nAnd burst the restraints.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them,\nA wolf of the deserts\
      \ will destroy them,\nA leopard is watching their cities.\nEveryone who goes\
      \ out of them will be torn in pieces,\nBecause their wrongdoings are many,\n\
      Their apostasies are numerous. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Why should I forgive you?\nYour sons have forsaken Me\nAnd sworn by those\
      \ who are not gods.\nWhen I had fed them to the full,\nThey committed adultery\n\
      And stayed at the prostitute’s house.\n"
    8: "⁸ They were well-fed lusty horses,\nEach one neighing at his neighbor’s wife.\n"
    9: "⁹ Shall I not punish them for these things?” declares the Lord,\n“And shall\
      \ I not avenge Myself\nOn a nation such as this? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Go up through her vine rows and destroy,\nBut do not execute a complete\
      \ destruction;\nStrip away her branches,\nFor they are not the Lord’s.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the house of Israel and the house of Judah\nHave dealt very treacherously\
      \ with Me,” declares the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² They have lied about the Lord\nAnd said, “Not He;\nMisfortune will not\
      \ come upon us,\nNor will we see sword or famine.\n"
    13: "¹³ The prophets are as wind,\nAnd the word is not in them.\nSo it will be\
      \ done to them!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of armies says:\n“Because you\
      \ have spoken this word,\nBehold, I am making My words fire in your mouth,\n\
      And this people wood, and it will consume them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from far away, you house of\
      \ Israel,” declares the Lord.\n“It is an enduring nation,\nIt is an ancient\
      \ nation,\nA nation whose language you do not know,\nNor can you understand\
      \ what they say.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Their quiver is like an open grave,\nAll of them are warriors.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They will devour your harvest and your food;\nThey will devour your sons\
      \ and your daughters;\nThey will devour your flocks and your herds;\nThey will\

    8: "⁸ But they are altogether stupid and foolish;\nThe instruction from idols\
      \ is nothing but wood!\n"
    9: "⁹ Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish,\nAnd gold from Uphaz,\nThe work\
      \ of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith;\nTheir clothing is of violet\
      \ and purple;\nThey are all the work of skilled people.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But the Lord is the true God;\nHe is the living God and the everlasting\
      \ King.\nThe earth quakes at His wrath,\nAnd the nations cannot endure His indignation.\

    11: "¹¹ This is what you shall say to them: “The gods that did not make the heavens\

    14: "¹⁴ Every person is stupid, devoid of knowledge;\nEvery goldsmith is put to\
      \ shame by his idols,\nFor his cast metal images are deceitful,\nAnd there is\
      \ no breath in them.\n"

      \ they will perish.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Portion of Jacob is not like these;\nFor He is the Maker of everything,\n\

    19: "¹⁹ Woe to me, because of my injury!\nMy wound is incurable.\nBut I said,\

      \ to set up my curtains.\n"
    21: "²¹ For the shepherds have become stupid\nAnd have not sought the Lord.\n\
      Therefore they have not prospered,\nAnd all their flock is scattered.\n"
    22: "²² The sound of a report! Behold, it is coming—\nA great roar from the land\

    24: "²⁴ Correct me, Lord, but with justice;\nNot with Your anger, or You will\
      \ bring me to nothing.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You,\nAnd on the families\
      \ who do not call upon Your name;\nFor they have devoured Jacob;\nThey have\
      \ devoured him and consumed him,\nAnd have laid waste his settlement."
  11:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the
      inhabitants of Jerusalem; '
    3: '³ and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: “Cursed
      is the one who does not obey the words of this covenant '
    4: '⁴ which I commanded your forefathers on the day that I brought them out of
      the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, ‘Listen to My voice, and do
      according to all that I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be
      your God,’ '
    5: "⁵ in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give\
      \ them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.”’” Then I replied,\
      \ “Amen, Lord.” \n"
    6: '⁶ And the Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and
      do them. '
    7: '⁷ For I solemnly warned your fathers on the day I brought them up from the
      land of Egypt, even to this day, warning them persistently, saying, “Listen
      to My voice.” '
    8: "⁸ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in the stubbornness\
      \ of their evil heart, each one of them; therefore I brought on them all the\
      \ words of this covenant which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’” \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of
      Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ They have turned back to the wrongdoings of their ancestors who refused
      to hear My words, and they have followed other gods to serve them. The house
      of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their
      fathers.” '
    11: '¹¹ Therefore this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am bringing disaster
      on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry out to Me,
      I will not listen to them. '
    12: '¹² Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and
      cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they certainly will not save
      them in the time of their disaster. '
    13: "¹³ For your gods are as many as your cities, Judah; and as many as the streets\
      \ of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars\
      \ for burning incense to Baal. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “So as for you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer\
      \ for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ What right has My beloved in My house\nWhen she has carried out many evil\
      \ schemes?\nCan the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster,\nSo\
      \ that you can rejoice?”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord named you\n“A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form”;\n\
      With the noise of a great tumult\nHe has set fire to it,\nAnd its branches are\
      \ worthless. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord of armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because\
      \ of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which they have\
      \ done to provoke Me by offering sacrifices to Baal. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Moreover, the Lord made it known to me and I knew it;\nThen You showed\
      \ me their deeds.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter;\nAnd I did not know\
      \ that they had devised plots against me, saying,\n“Let’s destroy the tree with\
      \ its fruit,\nAnd let’s cut him off from the land of the living,\nSo that his\
      \ name will no longer be remembered.”\n"
    20: "²⁰ But, Lord of armies, who judges righteously,\nWho puts the feelings and\
      \ the heart to the test,\nLet me see Your vengeance on them,\nFor to You I have\
      \ committed my cause. \n"
    21: '²¹ Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the people of Anathoth,
      who are seeking your life, saying: “Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord,
      so that you do not die by our hand”; '
    22: '²² therefore, this is what the Lord of armies says: “Behold, I am going to
      punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will
      die by famine; '
    23: ²³ and a remnant will not be left to them, because I will bring disaster on
      the people of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”
  12:
    1: "¹ Righteous are You, Lord, when I plead my case with You;\nNevertheless I\
      \ would discuss matters of justice with You:\nWhy has the way of the wicked\
      \ prospered?\nWhy are all those who deal in treachery at ease?\n"
    2: "² You have planted them, they have also taken root;\nThey grow, they have\
      \ also produced fruit.\nYou are near to their lips\nBut far from their mind.\n"
    3: "³ But You know me, Lord;\nYou see me\nAnd examine my heart’s attitude toward\
      \ You.\nDrag them off like sheep for the slaughter,\nAnd set them apart for\
      \ a day of slaughter!\n"
    4: "⁴ How long is the land to mourn,\nAnd the vegetation of the countryside to\
      \ dry up?\nDue to the wickedness of those who live in it,\nAnimals and birds\
      \ have been snatched away,\nBecause people have said, “He will not see our final\
      \ end.” \n"
    5: "⁵ “If you have run with infantrymen and they have tired you out,\nHow can\
      \ you compete with horses?\nIf you fall down in a land of peace,\nHow will you\
      \ do in the thicket by the Jordan?\n"
    6: "⁶ For even your brothers and the household of your father,\nEven they have\
      \ dealt treacherously with you,\nEven they have called aloud after you.\nDo\
      \ not believe them, though they say nice things to you.” \n"
    7: "⁷ “I have forsaken My house,\nI have abandoned My inheritance;\nI have handed\
      \ the beloved of My soul\nOver to her enemies.\n"
    8: "⁸ My inheritance has become to Me\nLike a lion in the forest;\nShe has roared\
      \ against Me;\nTherefore I have come to hate her.\n"
    9: "⁹ Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me?\nAre the birds of\
      \ prey against her on every side?\nGo, gather all the animals of the field,\n\
      Bring them to devour!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard,\nThey have trampled down My field;\n\
      They have made My pleasant field\nA desolate wilderness.\n"
    11: "¹¹ It has been made a desolation;\nDesolate, it mourns before Me;\nThe whole\
      \ land has been made desolate,\nBecause no one takes it to heart.\n"
    12: "¹² On all the bare heights in the wilderness\nDestroyers have come,\nFor\
      \ the sword of the Lord is devouring\nFrom one end of the land even to the other;\n\
      There is no peace for anyone.\n"
    13: "¹³ They have sown wheat but have harvested thorns,\nThey have strained themselves\
      \ to no profit.\nSo be ashamed of your produce\nBecause of the fierce anger\
      \ of the Lord.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ This is what the Lord says concerning all My wicked neighbors who do harm
      to the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel: “Behold, I am
      going to drive them out of their land, and I will drive the house of Judah out
      from among them. '
    15: '¹⁵ And it will come about that after I have driven them out, I will again
      have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance
      and each one to his land. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then, if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My
      name, ‘As the Lord lives,’ just as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they
      will be built up in the midst of My people. '
    17: ¹⁷ But if they do not listen, then I will drive out that nation, drive it
      out and destroy it,” declares the Lord.
  13:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and buy yourself a linen undergarment
      and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.” '
    2: '² So I bought the undergarment in accordance with the word of the Lord, and
      put it around my waist. '
    3: '³ Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, '
    4: '⁴ “Take the undergarment that you bought, which is around your waist, and
      arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.” '
    5: '⁵ So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me. '
    6: '⁶ After many days the Lord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates and take
      from there the undergarment which I commanded you to hide there.” '
    7: "⁷ Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the undergarment from the\
      \ place where I had hidden it; and behold, the undergarment was ruined, it was\
      \ completely useless. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “This is what the Lord says: ‘To the same extent I will destroy the pride
      of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. '
    10: '¹⁰ This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the
      stubbornness of their hearts and have followed other gods to serve them and
      to bow down to them, let them be just like this undergarment which is completely
      useless. '
    11: "¹¹ For as the undergarment clings to the waist of a man, so I made the entire\
      \ household of Israel and the entire household of Judah cling to Me,’ declares\
      \ the Lord, ‘so that they might be My people, for renown, for praise, and for\
      \ glory; but they did not listen.’ \n"
    12: '¹² “Therefore you are to speak this word to them. ‘This is what the Lord,
      the God of Israel says: “Every jug is to be filled with wine.”’ And when they
      say to you, ‘Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?’ '
    13: '¹³ then say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to
      fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit for David on his throne,
      the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness! '
    14: "¹⁴ Then I will smash them against each other, both the fathers and the sons\
      \ together,” declares the Lord. “I will not have compassion nor be troubled\
      \ nor take pity so as to keep from destroying them.”’” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Listen and pay attention, do not be haughty;\nFor the Lord has spoken.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Give glory to the Lord your God\nBefore He brings darkness\nAnd before\
      \ your feet stumble\nOn the mountains in the dark,\nAnd while you are hoping\
      \ for light\nHe makes it into gloom,\nAnd turns it into thick darkness.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ But if you do not listen to it,\nMy soul will weep in secret for such\
      \ pride;\nAnd my eyes will shed\nAnd stream down tears,\nBecause the flock of\
      \ the Lord has been taken captive.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Say to the king and the queen mother,\n“Take a lowly seat,\nFor your beautiful\
      \ crown\nHas come down from your head.”\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The cities of the Negev have been locked up,\nAnd there is no one to open\
      \ them;\nAll Judah has been taken into exile,\nWholly taken into exile. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Raise your eyes and see\nThose coming from the north.\nWhere is the flock\
      \ that was given you,\nYour beautiful sheep?\n"
    21: "²¹ What will you say when He appoints over you—\nAnd you yourself had taught\
      \ them—\nFormer companions to be head over you?\nWill sharp pains not take hold\
      \ of you\nLike a woman in childbirth?\n"
    22: "²² If you say in your heart,\n‘Why have these things happened to me?’\nBecause\
      \ of the magnitude of your wrongdoing\nYour skirts have been removed\nAnd your\
      \ heels have suffered violence.\n"
    23: "²³ Can the Ethiopian change his skin,\nOr the leopard his spots?\nThen you\
      \ as well can do good\nWho are accustomed to doing evil.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw\nTo the desert wind.\n"
    25: "²⁵ This is your lot, the portion measured to you\nFrom Me,” declares the\
      \ Lord,\n“Because you have forgotten Me\nAnd trusted in falsehood.\n"
    26: "²⁶ So I Myself have stripped your skirts off over your face,\nSo that your\
      \ shame will be seen.\n"
    27: "²⁷ As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings,\nThe outrageous sin\
      \ of your prostitution\nOn the hills in the field,\nI have seen your abominations.\n\

  14:
    1: "¹ That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah regarding the drought:\

      \ cisterns and found no water.\nThey have returned with their containers empty;\n\
      They have been put to shame and humiliated,\nAnd they cover their heads,\n"
    4: "⁴ Because the ground is cracked,\nFor there has been no rain on the land.\n\
      The farmers have been put to shame,\nThey have covered their heads.\n"
    5: "⁵ For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon her young,\n\
      Because there is no grass.\n"
    6: "⁶ The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights;\nThey pant for air like jackals,\n\
      Their eyes fail\nBecause there is no vegetation.\n"
    7: "⁷ Though our wrongdoings testify against us,\nLord, act for the sake of Your\

    8: "⁸ Hope of Israel,\nIts Savior in time of distress,\nWhy are You like a stranger\

    9: "⁹ Why are You like a confused person,\nLike a warrior who cannot save?\nYet\
      \ You are in our midst, Lord,\nAnd we are called by Your name;\nDo not leave\
      \ us!” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ This is what the Lord says to this people: “So much they have loved to
      wander; they have not restrained their feet. Therefore the Lord does not accept
      them; now He will remember their wrongdoing and call their sins to account.” '
    11: '¹¹ So the Lord said to me, “Do not pray for a good outcome on behalf of this
      people. '
    12: "¹² When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer\
      \ burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather,\
      \ I am going to put an end to them by the sword, famine, and plague.” \n"
    13: '¹³ But I said, “Oh, Lord God! Behold, the prophets are telling them, ‘You
      will not see a sword, nor will you have famine; on the contrary, I will give
      you lasting peace in this place.’” '
    14: '¹⁴ Then the Lord said to me, “The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My
      name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them, nor spoken to them; they
      are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility, and the deception
      of their own minds. '
    15: '¹⁵ Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the prophets who are prophesying
      in My name, although it was not I who sent them—yet they keep saying: ‘There
      will be no sword or famine in this land’—by sword and famine those prophets
      shall meet their end! '
    16: "¹⁶ And the people to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the\

    17: "¹⁷ You will say this word to them,\n‘Let my eyes stream down tears night\
      \ and day,\nAnd let them not cease;\nFor the virgin daughter of my people has\
      \ been crushed with a mighty blow,\nWith a sorely infected wound.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ If I go out to the country,\nThere are those killed by the sword!\nOr\
      \ if I enter the city,\nThere are diseases from famine!\nFor both prophet and\
      \ priest\nHave wandered around in the land that they do not know.’” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Have You completely rejected Judah?\nOr have You loathed Zion?\nWhy have\
      \ You stricken us so that we are beyond healing?\nWe waited for peace, but nothing\
      \ good came;\nAnd for a time of healing, but behold, terror!\n"
    20: "²⁰ We know our wickedness, Lord,\nThe wrongdoing of our fathers, for we have\

    21: "²¹ Do not despise us, for the sake of Your own name;\nDo not disgrace the\

    17: "¹⁷ I did not sit in a circle of revelers and celebrate.\nBecause of Your\
      \ hand upon me I sat alone,\nFor You filled me with indignation.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Why has my pain been endless\nAnd my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?\n\
      Will You indeed be to me like a deceptive stream\nWith water that is unreliable?\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Therefore, this is what the Lord says:\n“If you return, then I will restore\
      \ you—\nYou will stand before Me;\nAnd if you extract the precious from the\
      \ worthless,\nYou will become My spokesman.\nThey, for their part, may turn\
      \ to you,\nBut as for you, you are not to turn to them.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Then I will make you to this people\nA fortified wall of bronze;\nAnd\
      \ though they fight against you,\nThey will not prevail over you;\nFor I am\
      \ with you to save you\nAnd rescue you,” declares the Lord.\n"
    21: "²¹ “So I will rescue you from the hand of the wicked,\nAnd I will redeem\
      \ you from the grasp of the violent.”"
  16:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord also came to me, saying, '
    2: '² “You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this
      place.” '
    3: '³ For this is what the Lord says concerning the sons and daughters born in
      this place, and concerning their mothers who give birth to them, and their fathers
      who father them in this land: '
    4: "⁴ “They will die of deadly diseases, they will not be mourned or buried; they\
      \ will be like dung on the surface of the ground. And they will perish by sword\
      \ and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the sky\
      \ and for the animals of the earth.” \n"
    5: '⁵ For this is what the Lord says: “Do not enter a house of mourning, or go
      to mourn or to console them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people,”
      declares the Lord, “and My favor and compassion. '
    6: '⁶ Both great people and small will die in this land; they will not be buried,
      people will not mourn for them, nor will anyone make cuts on himself or have
      his head shaved for them. '
    7: '⁷ People will not break bread in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for
      the dead, nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone’s father or
      mother. '
    8: '⁸ Moreover, you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to
      eat and drink.” '
    9: "⁹ For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I\
      \ am going to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your time,\
      \ the voice of rejoicing and the voice of joy, the voice of the groom and the\
      \ voice of the bride. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Now it will happen that, when you tell this people all these words, they
      will say to you, ‘For what reason has the Lord declared all this great disaster
      against us? And what is our wrongdoing, or what is our sin that we have committed
      against the Lord our God?’ '
    11: '¹¹ Then you are to say to them, ‘It is because your forefathers have abandoned
      Me,’ declares the Lord, ‘and have followed other gods, and served and worshiped
      them; but they have abandoned Me and have not kept My Law. '
    12: '¹² You too have done evil, even more than your forefathers; for behold, each
      one of you is following the stubbornness of his own evil heart, without listening
      to Me. '
    13: "¹³ So I will hurl you off this land to the land which you have not known,\
      \ neither you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and\
      \ night, because I will show you no compassion.’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Therefore behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when it will
      no longer be said, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out
      of the land of Egypt,’ '
    15: "¹⁵ but, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land\
      \ of the north and from all the lands where He had banished them.’ For I will\
      \ restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “Behold, I am going to send for many fishermen,” declares the Lord, “and
      they will fish for them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they
      will hunt them from every mountain and every hill and from the clefts of the
      rocks. '
    17: '¹⁷ For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor
      is their wrongdoing concealed from My eyes. '
    18: "¹⁸ I will first repay them double for their wrongdoing and their sin, because\
      \ they have defiled My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses\
      \ of their detestable idols and their abominations.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Lord, my strength and my stronghold,\nAnd my refuge in the day of distress,\n\
      To You the nations will come\nFrom the ends of the earth and say,\n“Our fathers\
      \ have inherited nothing but falsehood,\nFutility, and things of no benefit.”\n"
    20: "²⁰ Can a person make gods for himself?\nBut they are not gods! \n"
    21: "²¹ “Therefore behold, I am going to make them know—\nThis time I will make\
      \ them know\nMy power and My might;\nAnd they will know that My name is the\
      \ Lord.”"
  17:
    1: "¹ The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus;\nWith a diamond point it\
      \ is engraved on the tablet of their hearts\nAnd on the horns of their altars,\n"
    2: "² As they remember their children,\nSo they remember their altars and their\
      \ Asherim\nBy green trees on the high hills.\n"
    3: "³ Mountain of Mine in the countryside,\nI will turn over your wealth and all\
      \ your treasures as plunder,\nYour high places for sin throughout your borders.\n"
    4: "⁴ And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance\nThat I gave\
      \ you;\nAnd I will make you serve your enemies\nIn the land which you do not\
      \ know;\nFor you have kindled a fire in My anger\nWhich will burn forever. \n"
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind\n\
      And makes flesh his strength,\nAnd whose heart turns away from the Lord.\n"
    6: "⁶ For he will be like a bush in the desert,\nAnd will not see when prosperity\
      \ comes,\nBut will live in stony wastes in the wilderness,\nA land of salt that\
      \ is not inhabited.\n"
    7: "⁷ Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,\nAnd whose trust is the Lord.\n"
    8: "⁸ For he will be like a tree planted by the water\nThat extends its roots\
      \ by a stream,\nAnd does not fear when the heat comes;\nBut its leaves will\
      \ be green,\nAnd it will not be anxious in a year of drought,\nNor cease to\
      \ yield fruit. \n"
    9: "⁹ “The heart is more deceitful than all else\nAnd is desperately sick;\nWho\
      \ can understand it?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I, the Lord, search the heart,\nI test the mind,\nTo give to each person\
      \ according to his ways,\nAccording to the results of his deeds.\n"
    11: "¹¹ As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid,\nSo is a person\
      \ who makes a fortune, but unjustly;\nIn the middle of his days it will abandon\
      \ him,\nAnd in the end he will be a fool.” \n"
    12: "¹² A glorious throne on high from the beginning\nIs the place of our sanctuary.\n"
    13: "¹³ Lord, the hope of Israel,\nAll who abandon You will be put to shame.\n\
      Those who turn away on earth will be written down,\nBecause they have forsaken\
      \ the fountain of living water, that is the Lord.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Heal me, Lord, and I will be healed;\nSave me and I will be saved,\nFor\
      \ You are my praise.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Look, they keep saying to me,\n“Where is the word of the Lord?\nLet it\
      \ come now!”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But as for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd following\
      \ after You,\nNor have I longed for the disastrous day;\nYou Yourself know that\

    19: '¹⁹ This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and stand at the public gate, through
      which the kings of Judah come in and go out, as well as at all the gates of
      Jerusalem; '
    20: '²⁰ and say to them, ‘Listen to the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah,
      and all Judah, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem who come in through these gates. '
    21: '²¹ This is what the Lord says: “Take care for yourselves, and do not carry
      any load on the Sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem. '
    22: '²² You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day nor do
      any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, just as I commanded your forefathers. '
    23: "²³ Yet they did not listen or incline their ears, but stiffened their necks\
      \ so as not to listen or accept discipline. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “But it will come about, if you give your attention to Me,” declares the
      Lord, “to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day,
      but to keep the Sabbath day holy by doing no work on it, '
    25: '²⁵ then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and officials
      sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their
      officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city
      will be inhabited forever. '
    26: '²⁶ They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the areas surrounding
      Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country,
      and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, and
      frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the Lord. '
    27: ²⁷ But if you do not listen to Me, to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying
      a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then
      I will set fire to its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and
      not go out.”’”
  18:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will announce My words
      to you.” '
    3: '³ So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, making something
      on the wheel. '
    4: "⁴ But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the\
      \ potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make.\

    5: '⁵ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Am I not able, house of Israel, to deal with you as this potter does?”
      declares the Lord. “Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in
      My hand, house of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom

    8: '⁸ if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent
      of the disaster that I planned to bring on it. '
    9: '⁹ Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom
      to build up or to plant it; '
    10: '¹⁰ if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will relent
      of the good with which I said that I would bless it. '
    11: '¹¹ So now, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
      saying, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am forming a disaster against
      you and devising a plan against you. Now turn back, each of you from his evil
      way, and correct your ways and your deeds!”’ '
    12: "¹² But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless! For we are going to follow our own\

    13: "¹³ “Therefore this is what the Lord says:\n‘Just ask among the nations,\n\

    14: "¹⁴ Does the snow of Lebanon leave the rock of the open country alone?\nOr\
      \ is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever dried up?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ For My people have forgotten Me,\nThey burn incense to worthless gods.\n\

    19: "¹⁹ Give Your attention to me, Lord,\nAnd listen to what my opponents are\

    20: "²⁰ Should good be repaid with evil?\nFor they have dug a pit for me.\nRemember\
      \ how I stood before You\nTo speak good in their behalf,\nSo as to turn Your\

    21: "²¹ Therefore, give their children over to famine\nAnd turn them over to the\

    23: "²³ But You, Lord, know\nAll their deadly schemes against me;\nDo not forgive\
      \ their wrongdoing\nOr wipe out their sin from Your sight.\nBut may they be\
      \ overthrown before You;\nDeal with them in the time of Your anger!"
  19:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord says: “Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jar, and
      take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests. '
    2: '² Then go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom, which is by the entrance of the
      Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you, '
    3: '³ and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and inhabitants
      of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold

      that hears of it will tingle. '
    4: '⁴ Since they have abandoned Me and have made this place foreign, and have
      burned sacrifices in it to other gods that neither they nor their forefathers
      nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and since they have filled this place
      with the blood of the innocent '
    5: '⁵ and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as
      burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I did not command nor speak of, nor did
      it ever enter My mind; '
    6: '⁶ therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when this place
      will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the
      Valley of Slaughter. '
    7: '⁷ And I will frustrate the planning of Judah and Jerusalem in this place,
      and I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand
      of those who seek their life; and I will make their carcasses food for the birds
      of the sky and the animals of the earth. '
    8: '⁸ I will also turn this city into an object of horror and hissing; everyone
      who passes by it will be appalled and hiss because of all its disasters. '
    9: "⁹ And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their\
      \ daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh during the siege and in the\
      \ hardship with which their enemies and those who seek their life will torment\

    10: '¹⁰ “Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you, '
    11: '¹¹ and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies says: “To the same extent
      I will break this people and this city, just as one breaks a potter’s vessel,
      which cannot again be repaired; and they will bury their dead in Topheth, because
      there is no other place for burial. '
    12: '¹² This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants,” declares the
      Lord, “so as to make this city like Topheth. '
    13: "¹³ The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled\
      \ like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned\

      \ gods.”’” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy;

    15: '¹⁵ “This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Behold, I am
      going to bring on this city and all its towns the entire disaster that I have

  20:
    1: '¹ When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief overseer in the
      house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, '
    2: '² Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were
      at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the Lord. '
    3: '³ Then on the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah
      said to him, “Pashhur is not the name the Lord has called you, but rather Magor-missabib. '
    4: '⁴ For this is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I am going to make you a horror
      to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will
      fall by the sword of their enemies. So I will hand all Judah over to the king
      of Babylon, and he will take them away as exiles to Babylon and will kill them
      with the sword. '
    5: '⁵ I will also give all the wealth of this city, all its produce and all its
      valuable things—even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will hand over
      to their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away, and bring them
      to Babylon. '
    6: "⁶ And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity;\
      \ and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried,\
      \ you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’” \n"
    7: "⁷ Lord, You persuaded me and I let myself be persuaded;\nYou have overcome\
      \ me and prevailed.\nI have become a laughingstock all day long;\nEveryone mocks\
      \ me.\n"
    8: "⁸ For each time I speak, I cry aloud;\nI proclaim violence and destruction,\n\
      Because for me the word of the Lord has resulted\nIn taunting and derision all\
      \ day long.\n"
    9: "⁹ But if I say, “I will not remember Him\nNor speak anymore in His name,”\n\
      Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire\nShut up in my bones;\nAnd I\
      \ am tired of holding it in,\nAnd I cannot endure it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For I have heard the whispering of many,\n“Terror on every side!\nDenounce\
      \ him; let’s denounce him!”\nAll my trusted friends,\nWatching for my fall,\
      \ say:\n“Perhaps he will be persuaded, so that we may prevail against him\n\
      And take our revenge on him.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ But the Lord is with me like a powerful champion;\nTherefore my persecutors\
      \ will stumble and not prevail.\nThey will be put to great shame because they\
      \ have failed,\nAn everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten.\n"
    12: "¹² Yet, Lord of armies, who tests the righteous,\nWho sees the mind and the\
      \ heart;\nLet me see Your vengeance on them,\nFor to You I have disclosed my\
      \ cause.\n"
    13: "¹³ Sing to the Lord, praise the Lord!\nFor He has saved the soul of the needy\
      \ one\nFrom the hand of evildoers. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Cursed be the day when I was born;\nMay the day when my mother gave birth\
      \ to me not be blessed!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Cursed be the man who brought the news\nTo my father, saying,\n“A boy\
      \ has been born to you!”\nAnd made him very happy.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But may that man be like the cities\nWhich the Lord overthrew without\
      \ relenting,\nAnd may he hear an outcry in the morning\nAnd an alarm for war\
      \ at noon;\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Because he did not kill me before birth,\nSo that my mother would have\
      \ been my grave,\nAnd her womb forever pregnant.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Why did I ever come out of the womb\nTo look at trouble and sorrow,\n\
      So that my days have been spent in shame?"
  21:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to
      him Pashhur the son of Malchijah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah,
      saying, '
    2: "² “Please inquire of the Lord in our behalf, because Nebuchadnezzar king of\
      \ Babylon is making war against us; perhaps the Lord will deal with us in accordance\

    3: '³ But Jeremiah said to them, “You shall say to Zedekiah as follows: '

      the wall; and I will gather them into the middle of this city. '
    5: '⁵ And I Myself will make war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty
      arm, and in anger, wrath, and great indignation. '
    6: '⁶ I will also strike the inhabitants of this city, both the people and the
      animals; they will die of a great plague. '
    7: "⁷ Then afterward,” declares the Lord, “I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah,\

      \ kill them with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them nor have pity\
      \ nor compassion.”’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “You shall also say to this people, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold,

    14: "¹⁴ But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds,” declares\
      \ the Lord,\n“And I will kindle a fire in its forest\nSo that it may devour\
      \ all its surroundings.”’”"
  22:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord says: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and
      there speak this word, '
    2: '² and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, who sits on David’s
      throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates. '
    3: '³ This is what the Lord says: “Do justice and righteousness, and save one
      who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor. And do not mistreat or
      do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent
      blood in this place. '
    4: '⁴ For if you will indeed perform this instruction, then kings will enter the
      gates of this house, sitting in David’s place on his throne, riding in chariots
      and on horses, the king himself, his servants, and his people. '
    5: '⁵ But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself,” declares the Lord,
      “that this house will become a place of ruins.”’” '
    6: "⁶ For this is what the Lord says concerning the house of the king of Judah:\n\
      “You are like Gilead to Me,\nLike the summit of Lebanon;\nYet most assuredly\
      \ I will make you a wilderness,\nCities that are not inhabited.\n"
    7: "⁷ For I will set apart destroyers against you,\nEach with his weapons;\nAnd\
      \ they will cut down your choicest cedars\nAnd throw them on the fire. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another,
      ‘Why has the Lord done this to this great city?’ '
    9: "⁹ Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord\
      \ their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him,\nBut weep deeply for the one\
      \ who goes away;\nFor he will never return\nOr see his native land. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For this is what the Lord says regarding Shallum the son of Josiah, king
      of Judah, who became king in the place of his father Josiah, who went out from
      this place: “He will never return there; '
    12: "¹² but in the place where they took him into exile, there he will die and\
      \ he will not see this land again. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness,\nAnd his upstairs\
      \ rooms without justice,\nWho uses his neighbor’s services without pay\nAnd\
      \ does not give him his wages,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Who says, ‘I will build myself a large house\nWith spacious upstairs rooms,\n\
      And cut out its windows,\nPaneling it with cedar and painting it bright red.’\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar?\nDid your father\
      \ not eat and drink\nAnd do justice and righteousness?\nThen it was well for\
      \ him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He pled the cause of the afflicted and the poor,\nThen it was well.\n\
      Is that not what it means to know Me?”\nDeclares the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “But your eyes and your heart\nAre intent only upon your own dishonest\
      \ gain,\nAnd on shedding innocent blood,\nAnd on practicing oppression and extortion.”\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore this is what the Lord says regarding Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,\
      \ king of Judah:\n“They will not mourn for him:\n‘Oh, my brother!’ or, ‘Oh,\
      \ sister!’\nThey will not mourn for him:\n‘Oh, for the master!’ or, ‘Oh, for\
      \ his splendor!’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will be buried with a donkey’s burial,\nDragged off and thrown out\
      \ beyond the gates of Jerusalem.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Go up to Lebanon and cry out,\nAnd raise your voice in Bashan;\nCry out\
      \ also from Abarim,\nFor all your lovers have been crushed.\n"
    21: "²¹ I spoke to you in your prosperity;\nBut you said, ‘I will not listen!’\n\
      This has been your way from your youth,\nThat you have not obeyed My voice.\n"
    22: "²² The wind will sweep away all your shepherds,\nAnd your lovers will go\
      \ into captivity;\nThen you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated\nBecause\
      \ of all your wickedness.\n"
    23: "²³ You who live in Lebanon,\nNested in the cedars,\nHow you will groan when\
      \ sharp pains come on you,\nPain like a woman in childbirth! \n"
    24: '²⁴ “As I live,” declares the Lord, “even if Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king
      of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off; '
    25: '²⁵ and I will hand you over to those who are seeking your life, yes, to those
      of whom you are frightened, that is, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the
      Chaldeans. '
    26: '²⁶ I will hurl you and your mother who gave birth to you into another country
      where you were not born, and there you will die. '
    27: "²⁷ But as for the land to which they long to return, they will not return\
      \ to it. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar?\nOr is he an undesirable\
      \ vessel?\nWhy have he and his descendants been hurled out\nAnd cast into a\
      \ land that they had not known?\n"
    29: "²⁹ O land, land, land,\nHear the word of the Lord! \n"
    30: "³⁰ This is what the Lord says:\n‘Write this man down as childless,\nA man\
      \ who will not prosper in his days;\nFor no man among his descendants will prosper\n\
      Sitting on the throne of David\nOr ruling again in Judah.’”"
  23:
    1: '¹ “Woe to the shepherds who are causing the sheep of My pasture to perish
      and are scattering them!” declares the Lord. '
    2: '² Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says concerning the shepherds
      who are tending My people: “You have scattered My flock and driven them away,
      and have not been concerned about them; behold, I am going to call you to account
      for the evil of your deeds,” declares the Lord. '
    3: '³ “Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries
      where I have driven them, and bring them back to their pasture, and they will
      be fruitful and multiply. '
    4: "⁴ I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they\
      \ will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing,”\
      \ declares the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,\n“When I will raise up\
      \ for David a righteous Branch;\nAnd He will reign as king and act wisely\n\
      And do justice and righteousness in the land.\n"
    6: "⁶ In His days Judah will be saved,\nAnd Israel will live securely;\nAnd this\
      \ is His name by which He will be called,\n‘The Lord Our Righteousness.’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when they will
      no longer say, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the sons of Israel up from the
      land of Egypt,’ '
    8: "⁸ but, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up and led the descendants of the household\
      \ of Israel back from the north land and from all the countries where I had\
      \ driven them.’ Then they will live on their own soil.” \n"
    9: "⁹ As for the prophets:\nMy heart is broken within me,\nAll my bones tremble;\n\
      I have become like a drunken man,\nAnd like a man overcome by wine,\nBecause\
      \ of the Lord\nAnd because of His holy words.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For the land is full of adulterers;\nFor the land mourns because of the\
      \ curse.\nThe pastures of the wilderness have dried up.\nTheir course is evil\n\
      And their might is not right.\n"
    11: "¹¹ “For both prophet and priest are defiled;\nEven in My house I have found\
      \ their wickedness,” declares the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them,\nThey will be\
      \ driven away into the gloom and fall down in it;\nFor I will bring disaster\
      \ upon them,\nThe year of their punishment,” declares the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing:\nThey\
      \ prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:\nThe\
      \ committing of adultery and walking in deceit;\nAnd they strengthen the hands\
      \ of evildoers,\nSo that no one has turned back from his wickedness.\nAll of\
      \ them have become to Me like Sodom,\nAnd her inhabitants like Gomorrah. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore this is what the Lord of armies says concerning the prophets:\n\
      ‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood\nAnd make them drink poisonous water,\n\
      For from the prophets of Jerusalem\nUngodliness has spread into all the land.’”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is what the Lord of armies says:\n“Do not listen to the words of\
      \ the prophets who are prophesying to you.\nThey are leading you into futility;\n\
      They tell a vision of their own imagination,\nNot from the mouth of the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They keep saying to those who despise Me,\n‘The Lord has said, “You will\
      \ have peace”’;\nAnd as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own\
      \ heart,\nThey say, ‘Disaster will not come on you.’\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But who has stood in the council of the Lord,\nThat he should see and\
      \ hear His word?\nWho has paid attention to His word and listened?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, the storm of the Lord has gone forth in wrath,\nEven a whirling\
      \ tempest;\nIt will swirl down on the head of the wicked.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The anger of the Lord will not turn back\nUntil He has performed and carried\
      \ out the purposes of His heart;\nIn the last days you will clearly understand\
      \ it.\n"
    21: "²¹ I did not send these prophets,\nBut they ran.\nI did not speak to them,\n\
      But they prophesied.\n"
    22: "²² But if they had stood in My council,\nThen they would have announced My\
      \ words to My people,\nAnd would have turned them back from their evil way\n\
      And from the evil of their deeds. \n"
    23: "²³ “Am I a God who is near,” declares the Lord,\n“And not a God far off?\n"
    24: "²⁴ Can a person hide himself in hiding places\nSo that I do not see him?”\
      \ declares the Lord.\n“Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name,
      saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’ '
    26: '²⁶ How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy
      falsehood, these prophets of the deceitfulness of their own heart, '
    27: '²⁷ who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they
      report to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal? '
    28: '²⁸ The prophet who has a dream may report his dream, but let him who has
      My word speak My word truthfully. What does straw have in common with grain?”
      declares the Lord. '
    29: '²⁹ “Is My word not like fire?” declares the Lord, “and like a hammer which
      shatters a rock? '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the Lord, “who
      steal My words from each other. '
    31: '³¹ Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the Lord, “who use their
      tongues and declare, ‘The Lord declares!’ '
    32: "³² Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams,” declares\
      \ the Lord, “and reported them and led My people astray by their lies and reckless\
      \ boasting; yet I did not send them nor command them, nor do they provide this\
      \ people the slightest benefit,” declares the Lord. \n"
    33: '³³ “Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you, saying, ‘What
      is the pronouncement of the Lord?’ then you shall say to them, ‘What pronouncement?’
      The Lord declares, ‘I will abandon you.’ '
    34: '³⁴ Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The pronouncement
      of the Lord,’ I will bring punishment upon that person and his household. '
    35: '³⁵ This is what each one of you will say to his neighbor and to his brother:
      ‘What has the Lord answered?’ or, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    36: '³⁶ For you will no longer remember the pronouncement of the Lord, because
      every person’s own word will become the pronouncement, and you have perverted
      the words of the living God, the Lord of armies, our God. '
    37: '³⁷ This is what you will say to that prophet: ‘What has the Lord answered
      you?’ and, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    38: '³⁸ And if you say, ‘The pronouncement of the Lord!’ for that reason the Lord
      says this: ‘Because you said this word, “The pronouncement of the Lord!” I have
      also sent word to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The pronouncement of the
      Lord!’”’ '
    39: '³⁹ Therefore behold, I will certainly forget you and thrust you away from
      My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers. '
    40: ⁴⁰ I will put an everlasting disgrace on you and an everlasting humiliation
      which will not be forgotten.”
  24:
    1: '¹ After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile Jeconiah the son
      of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and
      metalworkers from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed
      me: behold, two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord. '
    2: '² One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket
      had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness. '
    3: "³ Then the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs:\
      \ the good figs are very good, and the bad ones, very bad, which cannot be eaten\
      \ due to rottenness.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    5: '⁵ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so
      I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place
      into the land of the Chaldeans. '
    6: '⁶ For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this
      land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them
      and not uproot them. '
    7: "⁷ I will also give them a heart to know Me, for I am the Lord; and they will\
      \ be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me wholeheartedly.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness,’ indeed,
      this is what the Lord says, ‘so will I give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his
      officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and the ones
      who live in the land of Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ I will make them an object of terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of
      the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all the places
      where I will scatter them. '
    10: ¹⁰ And I will send the sword, the famine, and the plague upon them until they
      are eliminated from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.’”
  25:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the
      fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first
      year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), '
    2: '² the word which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and
      to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, '
    3: '³ “From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even
      to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the Lord has come to me, and
      I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened. '
    4: '⁴ And the Lord has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again,
      but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear, '
    5: '⁵ saying, ‘Turn now, everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your
      deeds, and live on the land which the Lord has given to you and your forefathers
      forever and ever; '
    6: '⁶ and do not follow other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not
      provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will do you no harm.’ '
    7: "⁷ Yet you have not listened to Me,” declares the Lord, “in order to provoke\
      \ Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Therefore this is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Because you have not obeyed
      My words, '
    9: '⁹ behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ declares the
      Lord, ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will
      bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these
      surrounding nations; and I will completely destroy them and make them an object
      of horror and hissing, and an everlasting place of ruins. '
    10: '¹⁰ Moreover, I will eliminate from them the voice of jubilation and the voice
      of joy, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the
      millstones and the light of the lamp. '
    11: "¹¹ This entire land will be a place of ruins and an object of horror, and\
      \ these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years. \n"
    12: '¹² ‘Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king
      of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the Lord, ‘for their wrongdoing, and the
      land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against
      it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all
      the nations. '
    14: "¹⁴ (For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them;\
      \ and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of\
      \ their hands.)’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup

    16: "¹⁶ Then they will drink and loudly vomit and act insanely because of the\

    22: '²² and to all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of
      the coastlands which are beyond the sea; '
    23: '²³ and to Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who trim the corners of their hair; '
    24: '²⁴ and to all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people

    27: '²⁷ “And you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God

      of the sword which I am sending among you.”’ '
    28: '²⁸ And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall

    32: "³² This is what the Lord of armies says:\n“Behold, evil is going out\nFrom\

    33: "³³ “Those put to death by the Lord on that day will be from one end of the\
      \ earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried; they will\
      \ be like dung on the face of the ground. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Wail, you shepherds, and cry out;\nWallow in the dust, you masters of\
      \ the flock;\nFor the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come,\n\

  26:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,

    11: "¹¹ Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the\
      \ people, saying, “A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against\
      \ this city, just as you have heard with your own ears!” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying,
      “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the
      words that you have heard. '
    13: '¹³ Now then, reform your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the Lord
      your God; and the Lord will relent of the disaster which He has pronounced against
      you. '
    14: '¹⁴ But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right
      in your sight. '
    15: "¹⁵ Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent\
      \ blood on yourselves, and on this city and its inhabitants; for truly the Lord\
      \ has sent me to you to speak all these words so that you hear them.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets,
      “No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the
      Lord our God.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly
      of the people, saying, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Micah of Moresheth used to prophesy in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah;\
      \ and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘This is what the Lord of\
      \ armies has said:\n“Zion will be plowed like a field,\nAnd Jerusalem will become\
      \ heaps of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.”’\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah actually put him to death? Did\
      \ he not fear the Lord and plead for the favor of the Lord, and the Lord relented\
      \ of the disaster which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing\
      \ a great evil against our own lives!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Indeed, there was also a man who used to prophesy in the name of the Lord,
      Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this
      city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah. '
    21: '²¹ When King Jehoiakim and all his warriors and all the officials heard his
      words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard about it, and
      he was afraid, so he fled and went to Egypt. '
    22: '²² Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and
      certain men with him, to Egypt. '
    23: "²³ And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who killed\
      \ him with a sword and threw his dead body into the burial place of the common\
      \ people. \n"
    24: ²⁴ But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he
      was not handed over to the people to put him to death.
  27:
    1: '¹ In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah,
      this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying— '
    2: '² this is what the Lord has said to me: “Make for yourself restraints and
      yokes and put them on your neck, '
    3: '³ and send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons
      of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come
      to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. '
    4: '⁴ Order them to go to their masters, saying, ‘This is what the Lord of armies,
      the God of Israel says: “This is what you shall say to your masters: '
    5: '⁵ ‘I have made the earth, mankind, and the animals which are on the face of
      the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to
      the one who is pleasing in My sight. '
    6: '⁶ And now I have handed all these lands over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
      My servant, and I have also given him the animals of the field to serve him. '
    7: "⁷ All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time\
      \ of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their\
      \ servant. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘And it will be that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him,
      Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and will not put its neck under the yoke of
      the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine,
      and with plague,’ declares the Lord, ‘until I have eliminated it by his hand. '
    9: '⁹ And as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers,
      your soothsayers, or your sorcerers who talk to you, saying, “You will not serve
      the king of Babylon.” '
    10: '¹⁰ For they are prophesying a lie to you in order to remove you far from
      your land; and I will drive you away and you will perish. '
    11: "¹¹ But the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of\
      \ Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land,’ declares the Lord,\
      \ ‘and they will cultivate it and live in it.’”’” \n"
    12: '¹² I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, “Bring
      your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people,
      and live! '
    13: '¹³ Why should you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine, and plague,
      as the Lord has spoken to the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? '
    14: '¹⁴ So do not listen to the words of the prophets who talk to you, saying,
      ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to
      you; '
    15: "¹⁵ for I have not sent them,” declares the Lord, “but they are prophesying\
      \ falsely in My name, so that I will drive you away and that you will perish,\
      \ you and the prophets who prophesy to you.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying: “This is what
      the Lord says: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to
      you, saying, “Behold, the vessels of the Lord’s house will now shortly be brought
      back from Babylon”; for they are prophesying a lie to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should
      this city become a place of ruins? '
    18: '¹⁸ But if they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, have
      them now plead with the Lord of armies that the vessels which are left in the
      house of the Lord and the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem do not
      go to Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ For this is what the Lord of armies says concerning the pillars, concerning
      the sea, concerning the kettle stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels
      that are left in this city, '
    20: '²⁰ which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he led into exile
      Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and
      all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— '
    21: '²¹ Yes, this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says concerning
      the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king
      of Judah and in Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² “They will be brought to Babylon and will be there until the day I visit
      them,” declares the Lord. “Then I will bring them back and restore them to this
      place.”’”
  28:
    1: '¹ Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of
      Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the prophet the son
      of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me at the house of the Lord in the sight
      of the priests and all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘I have broken
      the yoke of the king of Babylon. '
    3: '³ Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels
      of the Lord’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from this place
      and brought to Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim,\
      \ king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares\
      \ the Lord, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the sight of
      the priests and in the sight of all the people who were standing at the house
      of the Lord, '
    6: '⁶ and Jeremiah the prophet said, “Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord fulfill
      your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the Lord’s
      house and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place. '
    7: '⁷ Yet hear now this word which I am going to speak so that you and all the
      people can hear it! '
    8: '⁸ The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times also prophesied
      against many lands and against great kingdoms regarding war, disaster, and plague. '
    9: "⁹ As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet\
      \ comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the Lord has truly\
      \ sent.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the
      prophet and broke it. '
    11: "¹¹ Hananiah spoke in the sight of all the people, saying, “This is what the\
      \ Lord says: ‘Even so within two full years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’” Then Jeremiah the prophet\
      \ went his way. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet
      had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, ‘This is what the Lord says: “You have
      broken the yokes of wood, but in their place you have made yokes of iron.” '
    14: '¹⁴ For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “I have put
      a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Nebuchadnezzar king
      of Babylon; and they shall serve him. And I have also given him the animals
      of the field.”’” '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen now, Hananiah:
      the Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I am going to remove you\
      \ from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you spoke\
      \ falsely against the Lord.’” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year, in the seventh month.
  29:
    1: '¹ Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from
      Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets,
      and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to
      Babylon. '
    2: '² (This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the high officials,
      the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalworkers had
      departed from Jerusalem.) '
    3: '³ The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah
      the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon, saying, '
    4: '⁴ “This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles
      whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: '
    5: '⁵ ‘Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce. '
    6: '⁶ Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and
      give your daughters to husbands, so that they may give birth to sons and daughters;
      and grow in numbers there and do not decrease. '
    7: '⁷ Seek the prosperity of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray
      to the Lord in its behalf; for in its prosperity will be your prosperity.’ '
    8: '⁸ For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Do not let
      your prophets who are in your midst or your diviners deceive you, and do not
      listen to their interpretations of your dreams which you dream. '
    9: "⁹ For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,’ declares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “For this is what the Lord says: ‘When seventy years have been completed
      for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you
      back to this place. '
    11: '¹¹ For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans for
      prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. '
    12: '¹² Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen
      to you. '
    13: '¹³ And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your
      heart. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will let Myself be found by you,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will restore\
      \ your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where\
      \ I have driven you,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will bring you back to the place\
      \ from where I sent you into exile.’ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ “Because you have said, ‘The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’— '
    16: '¹⁶ for this is what the Lord says concerning the king who sits on the throne
      of David, and concerning all the people who live in this city, your brothers
      who did not go with you into exile— '
    17: '¹⁷ this is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Behold, I am sending upon them
      the sword, famine, and plague; and I will make them like rotten figs that cannot
      be eaten due to rottenness. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with plague; and I
      will make them an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a
      curse and an object of horror and hissing, and a disgrace among all the nations
      where I have driven them, '
    19: '¹⁹ because they have not listened to My words,’ declares the Lord, ‘which
      I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not
      listen,’ declares the Lord. '
    20: "²⁰ ‘You, therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles, whom I have\
      \ sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. \n"
    21: '²¹ ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says concerning Ahab
      the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying
      to you falsely in My name: “Behold, I am going to hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your eyes. '
    22: '²² Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who
      are in Babylon, saying, ‘May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom
      the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,’ '
    23: "²³ because they acted foolishly in Israel, and committed adultery with their\
      \ neighbors’ wives, and falsely spoke words in My name which I did not command\
      \ them. I am He who knows, and a witness,” declares the Lord.’” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Now you shall speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, '
    25: '²⁵ “This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you
      have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and
      to the priest Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying, '
    26: '²⁶ “The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the
      overseer of the house of the Lord for every insane person who prophesies, to
      put him in the stocks and in the iron collar. '
    27: '²⁷ So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to
      you, '
    28: "²⁸ seeing that he has sent word to us in Babylon, saying, ‘The exile will\
      \ be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce’?”’”\
      \ \n"
    29: '²⁹ Now Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    31: '³¹ “Send word to all the exiles, saying, ‘This is what the Lord says concerning
      Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I
      did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie,” '
    32: '³² therefore this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to punish Shemaiah
      the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will not have anyone living among this
      people, and he will not see the good that I am going to do for My people,” declares
      the Lord, “because he has spoken falsely against the Lord.”’”'
  30:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘Write all the words which
      I have spoken to you in a book. '
    3: "³ For behold, days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will restore the\
      \ fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’ The Lord says, ‘I will also bring\
      \ them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall take\
      \ possession of it.’” \n"
    4: "⁴ Now these are the words which the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah:\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ “For this is what the Lord says:\n‘I have heard a sound of terror,\nOf fear,\
      \ and there is no peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Ask now, and see\nIf a male can give birth.\nWhy do I see every man\nWith\
      \ his hands on his waist, as a woman in childbirth?\nAnd why have all faces\
      \ turned pale?\n"
    7: "⁷ Woe, for that day is great,\nThere is none like it;\nAnd it is the time\
      \ of Jacob’s distress,\nYet he will be saved from it. \n"
    8: '⁸ ‘It shall come about on that day,’ declares the Lord of armies, ‘that I
      will break his yoke from their necks and will tear to pieces their restraints;
      and strangers will no longer make them their slaves. '
    9: "⁹ But they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will\
      \ raise up for them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And do not fear, Jacob My servant,’ declares the Lord,\n‘And do not be\
      \ dismayed, Israel;\nFor behold, I am going to save you from far away,\nAnd\
      \ your descendants from the land of their captivity.\nAnd Jacob will return\
      \ and be at peace, without anxiety,\nAnd no one will make him afraid.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For I am with you,’ declares the Lord, ‘to save you;\nFor I will completely\
      \ destroy all the nations where I have scattered you,\nOnly I will not destroy\
      \ you completely.\nBut I will discipline you fairly\nAnd will by no means leave\
      \ you unpunished.’ \n"
    12: "¹² “For this is what the Lord says:\n‘Your broken limb is irreparable,\n\
      And your wound is incurable.\n"
    13: "¹³ There is no one to plead your cause;\nNo healing for your sore,\nNo recovery\
      \ for you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your lovers have forgotten you,\nThey do not seek you;\nFor I have\
      \ wounded you with the wound of an enemy,\nWith the punishment of a cruel one,\n\
      Because your wrongdoing is great,\nAnd your sins are numerous.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you cry out over your injury?\nYour pain is incurable.\nBecause\
      \ your wrongdoing is great\nAnd your sins are numerous,\nI have done these things\
      \ to you.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore all who devour you will be devoured;\nAnd all your adversaries,\
      \ every one of them, will go into captivity;\nAnd those who plunder you will\
      \ become plunder,\nAnd all who plunder you I will turn into plunder.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For I will restore you to health\nAnd I will heal you of your wounds,’\
      \ declares the Lord,\n‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying:\n“It\
      \ is Zion; no one cares for her.”’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “This is what the Lord says:\n‘Behold, I will restore the fortunes of\
      \ the tents of Jacob\nAnd have compassion on his dwellings;\nAnd the city will\
      \ be rebuilt on its ruins,\nAnd the palace will stand on its rightful place.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ From them will come a song of thanksgiving\nAnd the voices of those who\
      \ celebrate;\nAnd I will multiply them and they will not decrease;\nI will honor\
      \ them and they will not be insignificant.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Their children also will be as before,\nAnd their congregation will be\
      \ established before Me;\nAnd I will punish all their oppressors.\n"
    21: "²¹ Their leader shall be one of them,\nAnd their ruler will come out from\
      \ their midst;\nAnd I will bring him near and he shall approach Me;\nFor who\
      \ would dare to risk his life to approach Me?’ declares the Lord.\n"
    22: "²² ‘You shall be My people,\nAnd I will be your God.’” \n"
    23: "²³ Behold, the tempest of the Lord!\nWrath has gone forth,\nA sweeping tempest;\n\
      It will whirl upon the head of the wicked.\n"
    24: "²⁴ The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back\nUntil He has performed\
      \ and accomplished\nThe intent of His heart.\nIn the latter days you will understand\
      \ this."
  31:
    1: "¹ “At that time,” declares the Lord, “I will be the God of all the families\
      \ of Israel, and they shall be My people.” \n"
    2: "² This is what the Lord says:\n“The people who survived the sword\nFound grace\
      \ in the wilderness—\nIsrael, when it went to find its rest.”\n"
    3: "³ The Lord appeared to him long ago, saying,\n“I have loved you with an everlasting\
      \ love;\nTherefore I have drawn you out with kindness.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will build you again and you will be rebuilt,\nVirgin of Israel!\nYou\
      \ will take up your tambourines again,\nAnd go out to the dances of the revelers.\n"
    5: "⁵ Again you will plant vineyards\nOn the hills of Samaria;\nThe planters will\
      \ plant\nAnd will enjoy the fruit.\n"
    6: "⁶ For there will be a day when watchmen\nOn the hills of Ephraim call out,\n\
      ‘Arise, and let’s go up to Zion,\nTo the Lord our God.’” \n"
    7: "⁷ For this is what the Lord says:\n“Sing aloud with joy for Jacob,\nAnd be\
      \ joyful with the chief of the nations;\nProclaim, give praise, and say,\n‘Lord,\
      \ save Your people,\nThe remnant of Israel!’\n"
    8: "⁸ Behold, I am bringing them from the north country,\nAnd I will gather them\
      \ from the remote parts of the earth,\nAmong them those who are blind and those\
      \ who limp,\nThe pregnant woman and she who is in labor, together;\nThey will\
      \ return here as a great assembly.\n"
    9: "⁹ They will come with weeping,\nAnd by pleading I will bring them;\nI will\
      \ lead them by streams of waters,\nOn a straight path on which they will not\
      \ stumble;\nFor I am a father to Israel,\nAnd Ephraim is My firstborn.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord, you nations,\nAnd declare it in the coastlands\
      \ far away,\nAnd say, “He who scattered Israel will gather him,\nAnd He will\
      \ keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.”\n"
    11: "¹¹ For the Lord has ransomed Jacob\nAnd redeemed him from the hand of him\
      \ who was stronger than he.\n"
    12: "¹² “They will come and shout for joy on the height of Zion,\nAnd they will\
      \ be radiant over the bounty of the Lord—\nOver the grain, the new wine, the\
      \ oil,\nAnd over the young of the flock and the herd.\nAnd their life will be\
      \ like a watered garden,\nAnd they will never languish again.\n"
    13: "¹³ Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance,\nAnd the young men and the\
      \ old together;\nFor I will turn their mourning into joy\nAnd comfort them,\
      \ and give them joy for their sorrow.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will refresh the soul of the priests with abundance,\nAnd My people\
      \ will be satisfied with My goodness,” declares the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“A voice is heard in Ramah,\nLamenting and\
      \ bitter weeping.\nRachel is weeping for her children;\nShe refuses to be comforted\
      \ for her children,\nBecause they are no more.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is what the Lord says:\n“Restrain your voice from weeping\nAnd your\
      \ eyes from tears;\nFor your work will be rewarded,” declares the Lord,\n“And\
      \ they will return from the land of the enemy.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There is hope for your future,” declares the Lord,\n“And your children\
      \ will return to their own territory.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I have certainly heard Ephraim grieving,\n‘You have disciplined me, and\
      \ I was corrected,\nLike an untrained calf;\nBring me back that I may be restored,\n\
      For You are the Lord my God.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For after I turned back, I repented;\nAnd after I was instructed, I slapped\
      \ my thigh;\nI was ashamed and also humiliated\nBecause I bore the shame of\
      \ my youth.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is Ephraim My dear son?\nIs he a delightful child?\nIndeed, as often as\
      \ I have spoken against him,\nI certainly still remember him;\nTherefore My\
      \ heart yearns for him;\nI will certainly have mercy on him,” declares the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ “Set up roadmarks for yourself,\nPlace guideposts for yourself;\nDirect\
      \ your mind to the highway,\nThe way by which you went.\nReturn, O virgin of\
      \ Israel,\nReturn to these your cities.\n"
    22: "²² How long will you waver,\nYou rebellious daughter?\nFor the Lord has created\
      \ a new thing on the earth:\nA woman will shelter a man.” \n"
    23: "²³ This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Once again they\
      \ will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore\
      \ their fortunes,\n‘The Lord bless you, O place of righteousness,\nO holy hill!’\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Judah and all its cities will live together in it, the farmers and those
      who travel with flocks. '
    25: '²⁵ For I give plenty of water to the weary ones, and refresh everyone who
      languishes.” '
    26: "²⁶ At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep had been pleasant to me. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will sow the house
      of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of mankind and the seed of animals. '
    28: "²⁸ And just as I have watched over them to uproot them, tear them down, ruin,\
      \ destroy, and bring disaster on them, so I will watch over them to build and\
      \ to plant them,” declares the Lord. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “In those days they will no longer say,\n‘The fathers have eaten sour\
      \ grapes,\nBut it is the children’s teeth that have become blunt.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ But everyone will die for his own wrongdoing; each person who eats the\
      \ sour grapes, his own teeth will become blunt. \n"
    31: '³¹ “Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new
      covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, '
    32: '³² not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day I took
      them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they
      broke, although I was a husband to them,” declares the Lord. '
    33: '³³ “For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after
      those days,” declares the Lord: “I will put My law within them and write it
      on their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. '
    34: "³⁴ They will not teach again, each one his neighbor and each one his brother,\
      \ saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know Me, from the least of them\
      \ to the greatest of them,” declares the Lord, “for I will forgive their wrongdoing,\
      \ and their sin I will no longer remember.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ This is what the Lord says,\nHe who gives the sun for light by day\nAnd\
      \ the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night,\nWho stirs up\
      \ the sea so that its waves roar—\nThe Lord of armies is His name:\n"
    36: "³⁶ “If this fixed order departs\nFrom Me,” declares the Lord,\n“Then the\
      \ descendants of Israel also will cease\nTo be a nation before Me forever.”\n"
    37: "³⁷ This is what the Lord says:\n“If the heavens above can be measured\nAnd\

      \ all the descendants of Israel\nFor everything that they have done,” declares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    38: '³⁸ “Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when the city will be rebuilt
      for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. '
    39: '³⁹ The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead, to the hill Gareb;
      then it will turn to Goah. '
    40: ⁴⁰ And the entire valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the
      fields as far as the brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the
      east, shall be holy to the Lord; it will not be uprooted or overthrown ever
      again.”
  32:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah
      king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: '² Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem,
      and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which
      was at the house of the king of Judah, '
    3: '³ because Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy,
      saying, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to hand this city over
      to the king of Babylon, and he will take it; '
    4: '⁴ and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans,
      but he will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will speak
      with him face to face and see him eye to eye. '
    5: "⁵ Then he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit\
      \ him,” declares the Lord. “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not\
      \ succeed”’?” \n"
    6: '⁶ And Jeremiah said, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, '
    7: '⁷ ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying,
      “Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption
      to buy it.”’ '
    8: "⁸ Then my uncle’s son Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard in\
      \ accordance with the word of the Lord and said to me, ‘Buy my field, please,\
      \ that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right\
      \ of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew\
      \ that this was the word of the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ “So I bought the field which was in Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle’s son,
      and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver. '
    10: '¹⁰ And I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed
      out the silver on the scales. '
    11: '¹¹ Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed copy containing the
      terms and conditions and the open copy; '
    12: '¹² and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of
      Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle’s son and in the sight of the witnesses
      who signed the deed of purchase, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting
      in the courtyard of the guard. '
    13: '¹³ And I commanded Baruch in their sight, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Take these
      deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware
      jar, so that they may last a long time.” '
    15: "¹⁵ For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Houses and\
      \ fields and vineyards will again be purchased in this land.”’ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “After giving the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed
      to the Lord, saying, '
    17: '¹⁷ ‘Oh, Lord God! Behold, You Yourself have made the heavens and the earth
      by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for
      You, '
    18: '¹⁸ who shows mercy to thousands, but repays the wrongdoing of fathers into
      the laps of their children after them, great and mighty God. The Lord of armies
      is His name; '
    19: '¹⁹ great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways
      of the sons of mankind, giving to everyone according to his ways and according
      to the fruit of his deeds; '
    20: '²⁰ who has accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even
      to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and You have made a name for Yourself,
      as at this day. '
    21: '²¹ You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and
      with wonders, and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great
      terror; '
    22: '²² and You gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give
      them, a land flowing with milk and honey. '
    23: '²³ They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice
      or walk in Your Law; they did not do anything that You commanded them to do;
      therefore You have made all this disaster happen to them. '
    24: '²⁴ Behold, the assault ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city
      has been handed over to the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword,
      the famine, and the plague; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold,
      You see it. '
    25: "²⁵ Yet You have said to me, Lord God, “Buy for yourself the field with money\
      \ and call in witnesses”—although the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans.’”\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    27: '²⁷ “Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult
      for Me?” '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to hand this
      city over to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will
      take it. '
    29: '²⁹ And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will enter and set
      this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where people have offered incense
      to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke
      Me to anger. '
    30: '³⁰ For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil
      in My sight since their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking
      Me to anger by the work of their hands,” declares the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ “Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath
      since the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed
      from My sight, '
    32: '³² because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which
      they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their leaders, their
      priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. '
    33: '³³ They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught
      them, teaching again and again, they would not listen to accept discipline. '
    34: '³⁴ But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My
      name, to defile it. '
    35: "³⁵ They built the high places of Baal that are in the Valley of Ben-hinnom\
      \ to make their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to Molech, which\
      \ I had not commanded them, nor had it entered My mind that they should do this\
      \ abomination, to mislead Judah to sin. \n"
    36: '³⁶ “Now therefore the Lord God of Israel says the following concerning this
      city of which you say, ‘It has been handed over to the king of Babylon by sword,
      by famine, and by plague’: '
    37: '³⁷ Behold, I am going to gather them out of all the lands to which I have
      driven them in My anger, in My wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring
      them back to this place and have them live in safety. '
    38: '³⁸ They shall be My people, and I will be their God; '
    39: '³⁹ and I will give them one heart and one way, so that they will fear Me
      always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away
      from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts, so
      that they will not turn away from Me. '
    41: '⁴¹ I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them
      in this land with all My heart and all My soul. '
    42: '⁴² For this is what the Lord says: ‘Just as I brought all this great disaster
      on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising
      them. '
    43: '⁴³ And fields will be purchased in this land of which you say, “It is a desolation,
      without man or animal; it has been handed over to the Chaldeans.” '
    44: ⁴⁴ People will buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses
      in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, in the cities of
      Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and
      in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,’ declares the
      Lord.”
  33:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was
      still confined in the courtyard of the guard, saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says, He who made the earth, the Lord who formed
      it to create it, He whose name is the Lord: '
    3: '³ ‘Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty
      things, which you do not know.’ '
    4: '⁴ For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says concerning the houses
      of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been
      torn down to make a defense against the assault ramps and the sword: '
    5: '⁵ ‘While they are coming to fight the Chaldeans and to fill their houses with
      the bodies of people whom I have struck down in My anger and My wrath, and I
      have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness: '
    6: '⁶ Behold, I am going to bring to it healing and a remedy, and I will heal
      them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth. '
    7: '⁷ And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and
      will rebuild them as they were at first. '
    8: '⁸ And I will cleanse them from all their wrongdoing by which they have sinned
      against Me, and I will forgive all their wrongdoings by which they have sinned
      against Me and revolted against Me. '
    9: "⁹ It will be to Me a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations\
      \ of the earth, which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they\
      \ will be frightened and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that\
      \ I make for it.’ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “This is what the Lord says: ‘Yet again there will be heard in this place,
      of which you say, “It is a waste, without man and without animal,” that is,
      in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, without
      man and without inhabitant and without animal, '
    11: "¹¹ the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and\
      \ the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say,\n“Give thanks to the Lord\
      \ of armies,\nFor the Lord is good,\nFor His mercy is everlasting,”\nas they\
      \ bring a thanksgiving offering into the house of the Lord. For I will restore\
      \ the fortunes of the land as they were at first,’ says the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “This is what the Lord of armies says: ‘There will again be in this place
      which is waste, without man or animal, and in all its cities, a pasture for
      shepherds who rest their flocks. '
    13: "¹³ In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the\
      \ cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem,\
      \ and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of\
      \ the one who counts them,’ says the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Behold, days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will fulfill the
      good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of
      Judah. '
    15: '¹⁵ In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch of David
      sprout; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth. '
    16: '¹⁶ In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety; and
      this is the name by which it will be called: the Lord is our righteousness.’ '
    17: '¹⁷ For this is what the Lord says: ‘David shall not lack a man to sit on
      the throne of the house of Israel; '
    18: "¹⁸ and the Levitical priests shall not lack a man before Me to offer burnt\
      \ offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices continually.’”\
      \ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    20: '²⁰ “This is what the Lord says: ‘If you can break My covenant for the day
      and My covenant for the night, so that day and night do not occur at their proper
      time, '
    21: '²¹ then My covenant with David My servant may also be broken, so that he
      will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests,
      My ministers. '
    22: "²² As the heavenly lights cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot\
      \ be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of My servant David and the\
      \ Levites who serve Me.’” \n"
    23: '²³ And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    24: '²⁴ “Have you not observed what these people have asserted, saying, ‘The two
      families which the Lord chose, He has rejected them’? So they despise My people
      as no longer being a nation in their sight. '
    25: '²⁵ This is what the Lord says: ‘If My covenant for day and night does not
      continue, and I have not established the fixed patterns of heaven and earth, '
    26: ²⁶ then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, so as
      not to take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac,
      and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and have mercy on them.’”
  34:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king of
      Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under
      his control and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and all its
      cities, saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah
      king of Judah and say to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I am handing
      this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire. '
    3: '³ And as for you, you will not escape from his hand, for you will assuredly
      be caught and handed over to him; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to
      eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.’”’ '
    4: '⁴ Yet hear the word of the Lord, Zedekiah king of Judah! This is what the
      Lord says concerning you: ‘You will not die by the sword. '
    5: "⁵ You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former\
      \ kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will\
      \ mourn for you, crying, “Oh, my lord!”’ For I have spoken the word,” declares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah
      in Jerusalem '
    7: "⁷ when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and\
      \ all the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah, for they alone\
      \ remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah. \n"
    8: '⁸ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made
      a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem, to proclaim release to
      them: '
    9: '⁹ that each person was to set his male servant free and each his female servant,
      a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, so that no one would keep them, his Jewish brother
      or sister, in bondage. '
    10: '¹⁰ And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had entered into the
      covenant that each person was to set his male servant free and each his female
      servant, so that no one would keep them in bondage any longer; they obeyed,
      and set them free. '
    11: "¹¹ But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the\
      \ female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as\
      \ male servants and as female servants. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘I made a covenant with
      your forefathers on the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from
      the house of bondage, saying, '
    14: '¹⁴ “At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother
      who has been sold to you and has served you for six years, and you shall send
      him out free from you.” But your forefathers did not obey Me nor incline their
      ear to Me. '
    15: '¹⁵ Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each
      one proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before
      Me in the house which is called by My name. '
    16: "¹⁶ Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each person took back his male\
      \ servant and each his female servant whom you had set free according to their\
      \ desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male and female servants.’\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming
      release, each one to his brother and each to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming
      a release to you,’ declares the Lord, ‘to the sword, to the plague, and to the
      famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will give the people who have violated My covenant, who have not fulfilled
      the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf
      in two and passed between its parts— '
    19: '¹⁹ the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the high officials
      and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts
      of the calf— '
    20: '²⁰ I will hand them over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives.
      And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals
      of the earth. '
    21: '²¹ Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will also hand over to their
      enemies and to those who seek their lives, and to the army of the king of Babylon
      which has withdrawn from you. '
    22: ²² Behold, I am going to give a command,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will bring
      them back to this city, and they will fight against it and take it and burn
      it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’”
  35:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the
      son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, '
    2: '² “Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into
      the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.” '
    3: '³ So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers
      and all his sons, and all the household of the Rechabites, '
    4: '⁴ and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons
      of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was next to the chamber
      of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum,
      the doorkeeper. '
    5: '⁵ Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of
      wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!” '
    6: '⁶ But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our
      father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever. '
    7: '⁷ You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed nor plant a vineyard,
      nor own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, so that you may live
      many days in the land where you live as strangers.’ '
    8: '⁸ And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in
      all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our
      sons, or our daughters, '
    9: '⁹ nor to build ourselves houses to live in; and we do not have a vineyard,
      a field, or seed. '
    10: '¹⁰ But we have lived only in tents, and have obeyed and have done according
      to all that our father Jonadab commanded us. '
    11: "¹¹ However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land,\
      \ we said, ‘Come, and let’s go to Jerusalem away from the army of the Chaldeans\
      \ and the army of the Arameans.’ So we have lived in Jerusalem.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, '
    13: '¹³ “This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Go and say
      to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not accept
      instruction by listening to My words?” declares the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab have been followed, which he commanded
      his sons: not to drink wine. And they do not drink wine to this day, for they
      have obeyed their father’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again,
      yet you have not listened to Me. '
    15: '¹⁵ Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again
      and again, saying: ‘Turn now every person from his evil way and amend your deeds,
      and do not follow other gods to worship them. Then you will live in the land
      which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined
      your ear or listened to Me. '
    16: '¹⁶ Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have followed the command
      of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to
      Me.’”’ '
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore this is what the Lord says, the God of armies, the God of Israel:\
      \ ‘Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all\
      \ the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them\
      \ but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.’”\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “This is what the Lord
      of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab
      your father, kept all his commands, and done according to all that he commanded
      you, '
    19: '¹⁹ therefore this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Jonadab
      the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before Me always.”’”'
  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word
      came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, '
    2: '² “Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you
      concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I first spoke to
      you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. '
    3: "³ Perhaps the house of Judah will listen to all the disaster which I plan\
      \ to carry out against them, so that every person will turn from his evil way;\
      \ then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll
      at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which He had spoken to
      him. '
    5: '⁵ Jeremiah then commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted; I cannot go into
      the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ So you go and read from the scroll, which you have written at my dictation,
      the words of the Lord to the people at the Lord’s house on a day of fasting.
      And you shall also read them to all the people of Judah who come from their
      cities. '
    7: '⁷ Perhaps their pleading will come before the Lord, and everyone will turn
      from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that the Lord has pronounced
      against this people.” '
    8: "⁸ So Baruch the son of Neriah acted in accordance with all that Jeremiah the\
      \ prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the Lord in the\
      \ Lord’s house. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in
      the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from
      the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Baruch read to all the people from the book the words of Jeremiah\
      \ in the house of the Lord in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the\
      \ scribe, in the upper courtyard, at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord’s\
      \ house. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all
      the words of the Lord from the book, '
    12: '¹² he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber. And behold,
      all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of
      Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah
      the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. '
    13: '¹³ And Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch
      read from the book to the people. '
    14: '¹⁴ Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, who was the son
      of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll
      from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah
      took the scroll in his hand and came to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ And they said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch
      read it to them. '
    16: '¹⁶ When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another.
      And they said to Baruch, “We will certainly report all these words to the king.” '
    17: '¹⁷ Then they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us, please, how did you write all
      these words? Was it at Jeremiah’s dictation?” '
    18: '¹⁸ And Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote
      them with ink on the book.” '
    19: "¹⁹ Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah,\
      \ and do not let anyone know where you are.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ So they came to the king in the courtyard, but they had deposited the
      scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they reported all the words
      to the king. '
    21: '²¹ Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the
      chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to
      all the officials who were standing beside the king. '
    22: '²² Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with
      a fire burning in the brazier before him. '
    23: '²³ And when Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a
      scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all
      of the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. '
    24: '²⁴ Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words did not tremble
      in fear, nor did they tear their garments. '
    25: '²⁵ Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn
      the scroll, he would not listen to them. '
    26: "²⁶ And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel,\
      \ and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the\
      \ prophet, but the Lord hid them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the
      scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah,
      saying, '
    28: '²⁸ “Take again another scroll and write on it all the previous words that
      were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned. '
    29: '²⁹ And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘This is what the
      Lord says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it
      that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will
      make mankind and animals disappear from it?’” '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah:
      “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall
      be thrown out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. '
    31: "³¹ I will also punish him, his descendants, and his servants for their wrongdoing,\
      \ and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of\
      \ Judah all the disaster that I have declared to them—but they did not listen.”’”\
      \ \n"
    32: ³² Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch the
      son of Neriah, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words
      of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar
      words were added to them.
  37:
    1: '¹ Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made
      king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim. '
    2: "² But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the\
      \ words of the Lord which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet. \n"
    3: '³ Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and the priest Zephaniah
      the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the Lord
      our God in our behalf.” '
    4: '⁴ Now Jeremiah was still coming and going among the people, for they had not
      yet put him in prison. '
    5: "⁵ Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans\
      \ who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew\
      \ from Jerusalem. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, '
    7: '⁷ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘This is what you are to
      say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s
      army, which has come out to help you, is going to return to its own land of
      Egypt. '
    8: '⁸ Then the Chaldeans will return and fight against this city, and they will
      capture it and burn it with fire.”’ '
    9: '⁹ This is what the Lord says: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans
      will certainly go away from us,” for they will not go. '
    10: "¹⁰ For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting\
      \ against you, and there were only wounded men left among them, each man in\
      \ his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem
      because of Pharaoh’s army, '
    12: '¹² that Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to
      take possession of some property there among the people. '
    13: '¹³ While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name
      was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested
      Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!” '
    14: '¹⁴ But Jeremiah said, “A lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans”; yet he
      would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the
      officials. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they beat him, and put him
      in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made it into the
      prison. '
    16: "¹⁶ For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and\
      \ Jeremiah stayed there many days. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now King Zedekiah sent men and took him out; and in his palace the king
      secretly asked him and said, “Is there a word from the Lord?” And Jeremiah said,
      “There is!” Then he said, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon!” '
    18: '¹⁸ Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “In what way have I sinned against
      you, or your servants, or this people, that you have put me in prison? '
    19: '¹⁹ And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of
      Babylon will not come against you or against this land’? '
    20: '²⁰ But now, please listen, my lord the king; please let my plea come before
      you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so that I
      will not die there.” '
    21: ²¹ Then King Zedekiah gave a command, and they placed Jeremiah in custody
      in the courtyard of the guardhouse, and gave him a loaf of bread daily from
      the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained
      in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
  38:
    1: '¹ Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the
      son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah
      was speaking to all the people, saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says: ‘Anyone who stays in this city will die by
      the sword, by famine, or by plague; but anyone who surrenders to the Chaldeans
      will live and have his own life as plunder, and stay alive.’ '
    3: '³ This is what the Lord says: ‘This city will certainly be handed over to
      the army of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.’” '
    4: '⁴ Then the officials said to the king, “Please have this man put to death,
      since he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the
      people, by speaking words like these to them; for this man is not seeking the
      well-being of this people, but rather their harm.” '
    5: '⁵ And King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do
      nothing against you.” '
    6: '⁶ So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchijah the king’s
      son, which was in the courtyard of the guardhouse; and they let Jeremiah down
      with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah
      sank into the mud. '
    7: '⁷ But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king’s palace,
      heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cistern. Now the king was sitting at
      the Gate of Benjamin; '
    8: '⁸ and Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done
      to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have thrown into the cistern; and he will
      die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the
      city.” '
    10: '¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take thirty
      men from here under your authority and bring Jeremiah the prophet up from the
      cistern before he dies.” '
    11: '¹¹ So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king’s
      palace to a place beneath the storeroom, and took from there worn-out clothes
      and worn-out rags, and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah. '
    12: '¹² Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these worn-out
      clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes”; and Jeremiah did so. '
    13: "¹³ So they pulled Jeremiah out with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern,\
      \ and Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guardhouse. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then King Zedekiah sent word and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him
      at the third entrance that is in the house of the Lord; and the king said to
      Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.” '
    15: '¹⁵ And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly
      put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.” '
    16: "¹⁶ But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying, “As the Lord lives,\
      \ who made this life for us, I certainly will not put you to death, nor will\
      \ I hand you over to these men who are seeking your life.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord God of armies, the
      God of Israel says: ‘If you will indeed surrender to the officers of the king
      of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and
      you and your household will survive. '
    18: '¹⁸ But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then
      this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire,
      and you yourself will not escape from their hands.’” '
    19: '¹⁹ Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am in fear of the Jews who have
      deserted to the Chaldeans, for they may hand me over to them, and they will
      abuse me.” '
    20: '²⁰ But Jeremiah said, “They will not turn you over. Please obey the Lord
      in what I am saying to you, so that it may go well for you and you may live. '
    21: '²¹ But if you keep refusing to surrender, this is the word which the Lord
      has shown me: '
    22: "²² ‘Behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king\
      \ of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon;\
      \ and those women will say,\n“Your close friends\nHave misled and overpowered\
      \ you;\nWhile your feet were sunk in the mire,\nThey turned back.” \n"
    23: "²³ They are also going to bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans,\
      \ and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the\
      \ hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.’” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know about these words, and
      you will not die. '
    25: '²⁵ But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you
      and say to you, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said
      to you; do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death,’ '
    26: '²⁶ then you are to say to them, ‘I was presenting my plea before the king,
      not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’” '
    27: '²⁷ Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported
      to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and
      they stopped speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard. '
    28: ²⁸ So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until the day that Jerusalem
      was captured.
  39:
    1: '¹ Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah,
      in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to
      Jerusalem and laid siege to it; '
    2: '² in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth day
      of the month, the city wall was breached. '
    3: '³ Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the
      Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer
      the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. '
    4: '⁴ And when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they
      fled and left the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate
      between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah. '
    5: '⁵ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the
      plains of Jericho; and they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king
      of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. '
    6: '⁶ Then the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes
      at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: '⁷ He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in shackles of bronze to bring
      him to Babylon. '
    8: '⁸ The Chaldeans also burned the king’s palace and the houses of the people
      with fire, and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ And as for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters
      who had deserted to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan
      the captain of the bodyguard took them into exile in Babylon. '
    10: "¹⁰ But some of the poorest people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain\
      \ of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards\
      \ and fields at that time. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders regarding Jeremiah through
      Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying, '
    12: '¹² “Take him and look after him, and do not do anything harmful to him, but
      rather deal with him just as he tells you.” '
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word, along with Nebushazban
      the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of
      the king of Babylon; '
    14: "¹⁴ they even sent word and took Jeremiah out of the courtyard of the guardhouse\
      \ and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take\
      \ him home. So he stayed among the people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Now the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in
      the courtyard of the guardhouse, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘This is what the
      Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I am going to bring My words
      on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before
      you on that day. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will save you on that day,” declares the Lord, “and you will not
      be handed over to the men of whom you are afraid. '
    18: ¹⁸ For I will assuredly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but
      you will have your own life as plunder, because you have trusted in Me,” declares
      the Lord.’”
  40:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan captain of
      the bodyguard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains
      among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. '
    2: '² Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, “The
      Lord your God promised this disaster against this place; '
    3: '³ and the Lord has brought it and done just as He promised. Because you people
      sinned against the Lord and did not listen to His voice, this thing has happened
      to you. '
    4: '⁴ But now, behold, I am setting you free today from the chains that are on
      your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along, and
      I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon,
      do not come. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and
      right for you to go.” '
    5: '⁵ As Jeremiah was still not going back, he said, “Go on back then to Gedaliah
      the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed
      over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere
      it seems right for you to go.” So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration
      and a gift, and let him go. '
    6: "⁶ Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with\
      \ him among the people who were left in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their
      men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
      over the land, and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children,
      those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon. '
    8: '⁸ So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
      Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons
      of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, both they
      and their men. '
    9: '⁹ Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to
      their men, saying, “Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land
      and serve the king of Babylon, so that it may go well for you. '
    10: '¹⁰ Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay in Mizpah to stand for you before
      the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather wine, summer fruit, and
      oil, and put them in your storage vessels, and live in your cities that you
      have taken over.” '
    11: '¹¹ Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon
      and in Edom, and who were in all the other countries, heard that the king of
      Babylon had left a remnant for Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah
      the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. '
    12: "¹² Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been\
      \ scattered and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered\
      \ wine and summer fruit in great abundance. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that
      were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, '
    14: '¹⁴ and said to him, “Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons
      of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah
      the son of Ahikam did not believe them. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying,
      “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know! Why
      should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would
      be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?” '
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “Do not
      do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”
  41:
    1: '¹ Now in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama,
      of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, along with ten
      men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread
      together there in Mizpah, '
    2: '² Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him rose up,
      and struck and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the
      sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the
      land. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also struck and killed all the Jews who were with him, that is with\
      \ Gedaliah in Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one
      knew about it, '
    5: '⁵ that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their
      beards shaved off, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, having grain
      offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he
      went; and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” '
    7: '⁷ Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the
      son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them
      into the cistern. '
    8: "⁸ But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to\
      \ death, for we have supplies of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the\
      \ field.” So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men
      whom he had struck and killed because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King
      Asa had constructed on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of
      Nethaniah filled it with the dead. '
    10: "¹⁰ Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah,\
      \ the king’s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan\
      \ the captain of the bodyguard had put in the custody of Gedaliah the son of\
      \ Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross\
      \ over to the sons of Ammon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that
      were with him heard about all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had
      done. '
    12: '¹² So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
      and they found him by the large pool that is in Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son
      of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were
      joyful. '
    14: '¹⁴ So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around
      and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. '
    15: '¹⁵ But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,
      and went to the sons of Ammon. '
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that
      were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered
      from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck and killed Gedaliah the
      son of Ahikam, that is, the men who were soldiers, the women, the children,
      and the high officials, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem,
      in order to proceed into Egypt '
    18: ¹⁸ because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the
      son of Nethaniah had struck and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the
      king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah
      the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the small to the great approached '
    2: '² and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our pleading come before you,
      and pray for us to the Lord your God for all this remnant—since we have been
      left only a few out of many, just as your own eyes now see us— '
    3: '³ that the Lord your God will tell us the way in which we should walk, and
      the thing that we should do.” '
    4: '⁴ Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I am
      going to pray to the Lord your God in accordance with your words; and I will
      tell you the whole message which the Lord gives you as an answer. I will not
      withhold a word from you.” '
    5: '⁵ Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness
      against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which
      the Lord your God will send you to us. '
    6: "⁶ Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the\
      \ Lord our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well for us when\
      \ we listen to the voice of the Lord our God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Now at the end of ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the
      forces that were with him, and for all the people from the small to the great, '
    9: '⁹ and said to them, “This is what the Lord says, the God of Israel, to whom
      you sent me to present your plea before Him: '
    10: '¹⁰ ‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not
      tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent of
      the disaster that I have inflicted on you. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now fearing; do
      not be afraid of him,’ declares the Lord, ‘for I am with you to save you and
      rescue you from his hand. '
    12: '¹² I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you
      and restore you to your own soil. '
    13: '¹³ But if you are going to say, “We will not stay in this land,” so as not
      to listen to the voice of the Lord your God, '
    14: '¹⁴ saying, “No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see
      war, or hear the sound of a trumpet, or hunger for bread, and we will stay there”; '
    15: '¹⁵ then in that case listen to the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah.
      This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “If you really set
      your minds to enter Egypt and go in to reside there, '
    16: '¹⁶ then the sword, of which you are afraid, will overtake you there in the
      land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely
      after you there in Egypt, and you will die there. '
    17: "¹⁷ So all the people who set their minds to go to Egypt to reside there will\
      \ die by the sword, by famine, or by plague; and they will have no refugees\
      \ or survivors from the disaster that I am going to bring on them.”’” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “As My anger
      and wrath have gushed out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will
      gush out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object
      of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace; and you will not see this place again.” '
    19: '¹⁹ The Lord has spoken to you, you remnant of Judah, “Do not go to Egypt!”
      You know for certain that I have admonished you today. '
    20: '²⁰ For you have only deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the
      Lord your God, saying, “Pray for us to the Lord our God; and whatever the Lord
      our God says, tell us so, and we will do it.” '
    21: '²¹ So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the Lord your God in
      whatever He has sent me to tell you. '
    22: ²² And now you shall know for certain that you will die by the sword, by famine,
      or by plague in the place where you desire to go to reside.
  43:
    1: '¹ But as soon as Jeremiah, whom the Lord their God had sent to them, had finished
      telling all the people all the words of the Lord their God—that is, all these
      words— '
    2: '² Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant
      men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The Lord our God has not sent
      you to say, ‘You are not to enter Egypt to reside there’; '
    3: '³ but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us in order to hand
      us over to the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon!” '
    4: '⁴ So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all
      the people, did not obey the voice of the Lord to stay in the land of Judah. '
    5: '⁵ Instead, Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces
      took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which
      they had been scattered, in order to reside in the land of Judah— '
    6: '⁶ the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and every person
      whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son
      of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch
      the son of Neriah— '
    7: "⁷ and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the\
      \ Lord) and went in as far as Tahpanhes. \n"
    8: '⁸ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, '
    9: '⁹ “Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the
      brick terrace which is at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in
      the sight of some of the Jews; '
    10: '¹⁰ and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:
      “Behold, I am going to send men and get My servant Nebuchadnezzar the king of
      Babylon, and I am going to set his throne over these stones that I have hidden;
      and he will spread his canopy over them. '
    11: '¹¹ He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are meant for
      death will be given over to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and
      those for the sword to the sword. '
    12: '¹² And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will
      burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt
      as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there
      safely. '
    13: ¹³ He will also smash to pieces the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the
      land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire.”’”
  44:
    1: '¹ The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt,
      those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros,
      saying, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘You yourselves
      have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities
      of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them, '
    3: '³ because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke Me to anger
      by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known,
      neither they, you, nor your fathers. '
    4: '⁴ Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again, saying, “Oh,
      do not do this abominable thing which I hate.” '
    5: '⁵ But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness,
      so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods. '
    6: '⁶ Therefore My wrath and My anger gushed out and burned in the cities of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become ruins and a desolation
      as it is this day. '
    7: '⁷ Now then, this is what the Lord God of armies, the God of Israel says: “Why
      are you doing great harm to yourselves, to eliminate from yourselves man and
      woman, child and infant from among Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant, '
    8: '⁸ provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to
      other gods in the land of Egypt where you are entering to reside, so that you
      may be eliminated and become a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of
      the earth? '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the
      kings of Judah and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness and the
      wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the
      streets of Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ Yet they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared,\
      \ nor walked in My Law or My statutes, which I placed before you and before\
      \ your fathers.”’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Therefore this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Behold,
      I am going to set My face against you for a disaster, even to eliminate all
      Judah. '
    12: '¹² And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their minds on
      entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end
      in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword or meet their end by famine.
      From the small to the great, they will die by the sword and famine; and they
      will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace. '
    13: '¹³ And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I have
      punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with plague. '
    14: "¹⁴ So there will be no survivor or refugee for the remnant of Judah who have\
      \ entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of\
      \ Judah, to which they are longing to return to live; for none will return except\
      \ a few refugees.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices
      to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, as a large assembly,
      including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded
      to Jeremiah, saying, '
    16: '¹⁶ “As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord,
      we are not going to listen to you! '
    17: '¹⁷ But we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our
      mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings
      to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings, and our leaders did
      in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty
      of food and were well off and saw no misfortune. '
    18: '¹⁸ But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring
      out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and have met our end
      by the sword and by famine.” '
    19: "¹⁹ “And,” said the women, “when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of\
      \ heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands\
      \ that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image, and poured out drink\
      \ offerings to her?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women—even to all
      the people who were giving him such an answer—saying, '
    21: '²¹ “As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah
      and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your
      leaders, and the people of the land, did the Lord not remember them, and did
      all of this not come into His mind? '
    22: '²² So the Lord was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your
      deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; so your land has
      become a place of ruins, an object of horror, and a curse, without an inhabitant,
      as it is this day. '
    23: "²³ Since you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the Lord and\
      \ not obeyed the voice of the Lord nor walked in His Law, His statutes, or His\
      \ testimonies, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it has this day.”\
      \ \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the
      word of the Lord, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! '
    25: '²⁵ This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘As for you and
      your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands,
      saying, “We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices
      to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” By all means fulfill
      your vows, and be sure to perform your vows!’ '
    26: '²⁶ In return, hear the word of the Lord, all Judah who are living in the
      land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that
      My name shall never be invoked again by the mouth of anyone of Judah in all
      the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord God lives.” '
    27: '²⁷ Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the
      people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword
      or by famine until they are completely gone. '
    28: '²⁸ Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land
      of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land
      of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs. '
    29: '²⁹ And this will be the sign to you,’ declares the Lord, ‘that I am going
      to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will assuredly
      stand against you for harm.’ '
    30: '³⁰ This is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra
      king of Egypt over to his enemies, to those who seek his life, just as I handed
      Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy
      and was seeking his life.’”'
  45:
    1: '¹ This is the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of
      Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation, in
      the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says to you, Baruch: '
    3: '³ ‘You said, “Oh, woe to me! For the Lord has added grief to my pain; I am
      weary with my groaning and have found no rest.”’ '
    4: '⁴ This is what you are to say to him: ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold,
      what I have built I am going to tear down, and what I have planted I am going
      to uproot, that is, all the people of the land.” '
    5: ⁵ But as for you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them;
      for behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,’ declares the Lord, ‘but
      I will give your life to you as plunder in all the places where you may go.’”
  46:
    1: "¹ That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning\
      \ the nations. \n"
    2: "² To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by\
      \ the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated\
      \ in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: \n"
    3: "³ “Set up the buckler and shield,\nAnd advance to the battle!\n"
    4: "⁴ Harness the horses,\nAnd mount the steeds,\nTake your stand with helmets\
      \ on!\nPolish the spears,\nPut on the coats of armor!\n"
    5: "⁵ Why have I seen it?\nThey are terrified,\nThey are retreating,\nAnd their\
      \ warriors are defeated\nAnd have taken refuge in flight,\nWithout facing back.\n\
      Terror is on every side!”\nDeclares the Lord.\n"
    6: "⁶ Let not the swift man flee,\nNor the warrior escape.\nIn the north beside\
      \ the river Euphrates\nThey have stumbled and fallen.\n"
    7: "⁷ Who is this that rises like the Nile,\nLike the rivers whose waters surge?\n"
    8: "⁸ Egypt rises like the Nile,\nAnd like the rivers whose waters surge;\nAnd\
      \ He has said, “I will rise and cover that land;\nI will destroy the city and\

    9: "⁹ Go up, you horses, and drive wildly, you chariots,\nSo that the warriors\
      \ may march forward:\nCush and Put, who handle the shield,\nAnd the Lydians,\
      \ who handle and bend the bow.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ For that day belongs to the Lord God of armies,\nA day of vengeance, so\
      \ as to avenge Himself on His foes;\nAnd the sword will devour and be satisfied,\n\
      And drink its fill of their blood;\nFor there will be a slaughter for the Lord\
      \ God of armies,\nIn the land of the north at the river Euphrates.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Go up to Gilead and obtain balm,\nVirgin daughter of Egypt!\nYou have\
      \ used many remedies in vain;\nThere is no healing for you.\n"
    12: "¹² The nations have heard of your shame,\nAnd the earth is full of your cry\
      \ of distress;\nFor one warrior has stumbled over another,\nAnd both of them\
      \ have fallen down together. \n"
    13: "¹³ This is the message which the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about\

      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol,\nProclaim also in Memphis and\

    15: "¹⁵ Why have your powerful ones been cut down?\nThey do not stand because\
      \ the Lord has thrust them away.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They have repeatedly stumbled;\nIndeed, they have fallen, one against\

      \ our native land,\nAway from the sword of the oppressor!’\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They shouted there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is nothing but a big noise;\n\
      He has let the appointed time pass by!’\n"
    18: "¹⁸ As I live,” declares the King,\nWhose name is the Lord of armies,\n“One\

      \ by the sea.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Make your baggage ready for exile,\nDaughter living in Egypt,\nFor Memphis\

    20: "²⁰ Egypt is a pretty heifer,\nBut a horsefly is coming from the north—it\

    21: "²¹ Also her mercenaries in her midst\nAre like fattened calves,\nFor they\

    25: "²⁵ The Lord has opened His armory\nAnd has brought out the weapons of His\
      \ indignation,\nFor it is a work of the Lord God of armies\nIn the land of the\
      \ Chaldeans.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Come to her from the farthest border;\nOpen up her barns,\nPile her up\
      \ like heaps of grain\nAnd completely destroy her,\nLet nothing be left to her.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Put all her bulls to the sword;\nLet them go down to the slaughter!\n\
      Woe be upon them, for their day has come,\nThe time of their punishment. \n"
    28: "²⁸ There is a sound of fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon,\n\
      To declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God,\nVengeance for His temple.\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Summon many against Babylon,\nAll those who bend the bow:\nEncamp against\
      \ her on every side,\nLet there be no escape.\nRepay her according to her work;\n\
      According to all that she has done, so do to her;\nFor she has become arrogant\
      \ against the Lord,\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,\nAnd all her men of\
      \ war will perish on that day,” declares the Lord.\n"
    31: "³¹ “Behold, I am against you, arrogant one,”\nDeclares the Lord God of armies,\n\
      “For your day has come,\nThe time when I will punish you.\n"
    32: "³² The arrogant one will stumble and fall\nWith no one to raise him up;\n\
      And I will set fire to his cities,\nAnd it will devour all his surroundings.”\
      \ \n"
    33: "³³ This is what the Lord of armies says:\n“The sons of Israel are oppressed,\n\
      And the sons of Judah as well;\nAnd all who took them captive have held them\
      \ firmly,\nThey have refused to let them go.\n"
    34: "³⁴ Their Redeemer is strong, the Lord of armies is His name;\nHe will vigorously\
      \ plead their case\nSo that He may bring rest to their land,\nBut turmoil to\
      \ the inhabitants of Babylon.\n"
    35: "³⁵ A sword against the Chaldeans,” declares the Lord,\n“And against the inhabitants\
      \ of Babylon\nAnd against her leaders and her wise men!\n"
    36: "³⁶ A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become fools!\nA sword\
      \ against her warriors, and they will be shattered!\n"
    37: "³⁷ A sword against their horses, against their chariots,\nAnd against all\
      \ the foreigners who are in the midst of her,\nAnd they will become women!\n\
      A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered!\n"
    38: "³⁸ A drought on her waters, and they will be dried up!\nFor it is a land\
      \ of idols,\nAnd they go insane at frightful images. \n"
    39: "³⁹ “Therefore the desert creatures will live there with the jackals;\nThe\
      \ ostriches also will live in it.\nIt will never again be inhabited\nNor lived\
      \ in from generation to generation.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ As when God overthrew Sodom\nAnd Gomorrah with its neighbors,” declares\
      \ the Lord,\n“No one will live there,\nNor will anyone of mankind reside in\
      \ it. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “Behold, a people is coming from the north,\nAnd a great nation and many\
      \ kings\nWill be roused from the remote parts of the earth.\n"
    42: "⁴² They seize their bow and javelin;\nThey are cruel and have no mercy.\n\
      Their voice roars like the sea;\nAnd they ride on horses,\nDrawn up like a man\
      \ for the battle\nAgainst you, daughter of Babylon.\n"
    43: "⁴³ The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,\nAnd his hands hang\
      \ limp;\nDistress has gripped him,\nAgony like a woman in childbirth. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ “Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to
      a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will chase them away from
      it, and I will appoint over it whoever is chosen. For who is like Me, and who
      will summon Me into court? And who then is the shepherd who can stand against
      Me?” '
    45: '⁴⁵ Therefore hear the plan of the Lord which He has planned against Babylon,
      and His purposes which He has in mind against the land of the Chaldeans: they
      will certainly drag them off, even the little ones of the flock; He will certainly
      make their pasture desolate because of them. '
    46: ⁴⁶ At the shout, “Babylon has been conquered!” the earth quakes, and an outcry
      is heard among the nations.
  51:
    1: "¹ This is what the Lord says:\n“Behold, I am going to stir up\nThe spirit\
      \ of a destroyer against Babylon\nAnd against the inhabitants of Leb-kamai.\n"
    2: "² I will send foreigners to Babylon so that they may winnow her\nAnd devastate\
      \ her land;\nFor they will be opposed to her on every side\nOn the day of her\
      \ disaster.\n"
    3: "³ Let not him who bends his bow bend it,\nNor let him rise up in his coat\
      \ of armor.\nDo not spare her young men;\nDevote all her army to destruction.\n"
    4: "⁴ They will fall down dead in the land of the Chaldeans,\nAnd pierced through\
      \ in their streets.” \n"
    5: "⁵ For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken\nBy his God, the Lord of\
      \ armies,\nAlthough their land is full of guilt\nBefore the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    6: "⁶ Flee from the midst of Babylon,\nAnd each of you save his life!\nDo not\
      \ perish in her punishment,\nFor this is the Lord’s time of vengeance;\nHe is\
      \ going to repay to her what she deserves.\n"
    7: "⁷ Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord,\nIntoxicating all\
      \ the earth.\nThe nations have drunk of her wine;\nTherefore the nations are\
      \ going insane.\n"
    8: "⁸ Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;\nWail over her!\nBring balm\
      \ for her pain;\nPerhaps she may be healed.\n"
    9: "⁹ We applied healing to Babylon, but she was not healed;\nAbandon her and\
      \ let’s each go to his own country,\nFor her judgment has reached to heaven\n\
      And it rises to the clouds.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord has brought about our vindication;\nCome and let’s recount in\
      \ Zion\nThe work of the Lord our God! \n"
    11: "¹¹ Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers!\nThe Lord has stirred up the spirit\
      \ of the kings of the Medes,\nBecause His plan is against Babylon to destroy\
      \ it;\nFor it is the vengeance of the Lord, vengeance for His temple.\n"
    12: "¹² Lift up a signal flag against the walls of Babylon;\nPost a strong guard,\n\
      Station sentries,\nSet up an ambush!\nFor the Lord has both planned and performed\n\
      What He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\n"
    13: "¹³ You who live by many waters,\nAbundant in treasures,\nYour end has come,\n\
      The measure of your end.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord of armies has sworn by Himself:\n“I will certainly fill you with\
      \ a population like locusts,\nAnd they will cry out with shouts of victory over\
      \ you.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ It is He who made the earth by His power,\nWho established the world by\
      \ His wisdom,\nAnd by His understanding He stretched out the heavens.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ When He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens,\n\
      And He makes the clouds ascend from the end of the earth.\nHe makes lightning\
      \ for the rain\nAnd brings out wind from His storehouses.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Every person is stupid, devoid of knowledge;\nEvery goldsmith is put to\
      \ shame by his idols,\nFor his cast metal images are deceitful,\nAnd there is\
      \ no breath in them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ They are worthless, a work of mockery;\nAt the time of their punishment\
      \ they will perish.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The portion of Jacob is not like these;\nFor He is the Maker of everything,\n\
      And of the tribe of His inheritance;\nThe Lord of armies is His name.\n"
    20: "²⁰ He says, “You are My war-club, My weapon of war;\nAnd with you I shatter\
      \ nations,\nAnd with you I destroy kingdoms.\n"
    21: "²¹ With you I shatter the horse and his rider,\nAnd with you I shatter the\
      \ chariot and its rider,\n"
    22: "²² And with you I shatter man and woman,\nAnd with you I shatter the old\
      \ man and youth,\nAnd with you I shatter the young man and virgin,\n"
    23: "²³ And with you I shatter the shepherd and his flock,\nAnd with you I shatter\
      \ the farmer and his team,\nAnd with you I shatter governors and officials.\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ “But I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their\
      \ evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes,” declares the Lord. \n"
    25: "²⁵ “Behold, I am against you, mountain of destruction\nThat destroys the\
      \ whole earth,” declares the Lord,\n“And I will stretch out My hand against\
      \ you,\nAnd roll you down from the rocky cliffs,\nAnd I will make you a burnt\
      \ out mountain.\n"
    26: "²⁶ They will not take from you even a stone for a corner\nNor a stone for\
      \ foundations,\nBut you will be desolate forever,” declares the Lord. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Lift up a signal flag in the land,\nBlow a trumpet among the nations!\n\
      Consecrate the nations against her,\nSummon against her the kingdoms of Ararat,\
      \ Minni, and Ashkenaz;\nAppoint an officer against her,\nBring up the horses\
      \ like bristly locusts.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Consecrate the nations against her,\nThe kings of the Medes,\nTheir governors\
      \ and all their officials,\nAnd every land under their control.\n"
    29: "²⁹ So the land quakes and writhes,\nFor the plans of the Lord against Babylon\
      \ stand,\nTo make the land of Babylon\nA desolation without inhabitants.\n"
    30: "³⁰ The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting,\nThey stay in the strongholds;\n\
      Their strength is exhausted,\nThey are becoming like women;\nTheir homes are\
      \ set on fire,\nThe bars of her gates are broken.\n"
    31: "³¹ One courier runs to meet another,\nAnd one messenger to meet another,\n\
      To tell the king of Babylon\nThat his city has been captured from end to end;\n"
    32: "³² The river crossing places have been seized,\nAnd they have burned the\
      \ marshes with fire,\nAnd the men of war are terrified. \n"
    33: "³³ For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:\n“The daughter\
      \ of Babylon is like a threshing floor\nAt the time that it is tread down;\n\
      In just a little while the time of harvest will come for her.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ “Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me,\n\
      He has set me down like an empty vessel;\nHe has swallowed me like a monster,\n\
      He has filled his stomach with my delicacies;\nHe has washed me away.\n"
    35: "³⁵ May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,”\nThe inhabitant\
      \ of Zion will say;\nAnd, “May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”\n\
      Jerusalem will say. \n"
    36: "³⁶ Therefore this is what the Lord says:\n“Behold, I am going to plead your\
      \ case\nAnd take vengeance for you;\nAnd I will dry up her sea\nAnd make her\
      \ fountain dry.\n"
    37: "³⁷ Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals,\nAn object of\
      \ horror and hissing, without inhabitants.\n"
    38: "³⁸ They will roar together like young lions,\nThey will growl like lions’\
      \ cubs.\n"
    39: "³⁹ When they become heated up, I will serve them their banquet\nAnd make\
      \ them drunk, so that they may rejoice in triumph,\nAnd may sleep a perpetual\
      \ sleep\nAnd not wake up,” declares the Lord.\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ “I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,\nLike rams together\
      \ with male goats. \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “How Sheshak has been captured,\nAnd the praise of the whole earth has\
      \ been seized!\nHow Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!\n"
    42: "⁴² The sea has come up over Babylon;\nShe has been engulfed by its roaring\
      \ waves.\n"
    43: "⁴³ Her cities have become an object of horror,\nA dry land and a desert,\n\
      A land in which no one lives\nAnd through which no one of mankind passes.\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ I will punish Bel in Babylon,\nAnd I will make what he has swallowed come\
      \ out of his mouth;\nAnd the nations will no longer stream toward him.\nEven\
      \ the wall of Babylon has fallen down! \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ “Come out from her midst, My people,\nAnd each of you save yourselves\n\
      From the fierce anger of the Lord.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Now, so that your heart does not grow faint,\nAnd you are not afraid at\
      \ the report that will be heard in the land—\nFor the report will come in one\
      \ year,\nAnd after that another report in another year,\nAnd violence will be\
      \ in the land\nWith ruler against ruler—\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Therefore behold, days are coming\nWhen I will punish the idols of Babylon;\n\
      And her whole land will be put to shame.\nAnd all her slain will fall in her\
      \ midst.\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Then heaven and earth and everything that is in them\nWill shout for joy\
      \ over Babylon,\nBecause the destroyers will come to her from the north,”\n\
      Declares the Lord. \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ Indeed, Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel,\nAs the slain of all\
      \ the earth have also fallen for Babylon.\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ You who have escaped the sword,\nGo! Do not stay!\nRemember the Lord from\
      \ far away,\nAnd let Jerusalem come to your mind.\n"
    51: "⁵¹ We are ashamed because we have heard rebuke;\nDisgrace has covered our\
      \ faces,\nBecause strangers have entered\nThe holy places of the Lord’s house.\
      \ \n"
    52: "⁵² “Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,\n“When I will\
      \ punish her idols,\nAnd the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land.\n"
    53: "⁵³ Though Babylon ascends to the heavens,\nAnd though she fortifies her lofty\
      \ stronghold,\nDestroyers will come from Me to her,” declares the Lord. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ The sound of an outcry from Babylon,\nAnd of great destruction from the\
      \ land of the Chaldeans!\n"
    55: "⁵⁵ For the Lord is going to destroy Babylon,\nAnd He will make her loud noise\
      \ vanish from her.\nAnd their waves will roar like many waters;\nThe clamor\
      \ of their voices sounds forth.\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ For the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon,\nAnd her warriors\
      \ will be captured,\nTheir bows shattered;\nFor the Lord is a God of retribution,\n\
      He will fully repay.\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ “I will make her leaders and her wise men drunk,\nHer governors, her officials,\
      \ and her warriors,\nSo that they will sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake\
      \ up,”\nDeclares the King, whose name is the Lord of armies. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ This is what the Lord of armies says:\n“The broad wall of Babylon will\
      \ be completely demolished,\nAnd her high gates will be set on fire;\nSo the\
      \ peoples will labor for nothing,\nAnd the nations become exhausted only for\
      \ fire.” \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ The command that Jeremiah the prophet gave Seraiah the son of Neriah,
      the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon
      in the fourth year of his reign. (And Seraiah was quartermaster.) '
    60: '⁶⁰ Jeremiah wrote on a single scroll all the disaster which would come against
      Babylon, that is, all these words which have been written concerning Babylon. '
    61: '⁶¹ Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “As soon as you come to Babylon, see that
      you read all these words aloud, '
    62: '⁶² and say, ‘You, Lord, have promised concerning this place to cut it off,
      so that there will be nothing living in it, whether man or animal; but it will
      be a permanent desolation.’ '
    63: '⁶³ And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you shall tie a stone to
      it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates, '
    64: ⁶⁴ and say, ‘Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again, because of
      the disaster that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.’”
      To this point are the words of Jeremiah.
  52:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned for
      eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of
      Jeremiah of Libnah. '
    2: '² He did evil in the sight of the Lord, in accordance with everything that
      Jehoiakim had done. '
    3: '³ For because of the anger of the Lord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah,
      until He drove them out from His presence. And Zedekiah revolted against the
      king of Babylon. '
    4: '⁴ Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the
      tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army,
      against Jerusalem, camped against it, and built a bulwark all around it. '
    5: '⁵ So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. '
    6: '⁶ On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city
      that there was no food for the people of the land. '
    7: '⁷ Then the city was breached, and all the warriors fled and left the city
      at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king’s garden,
      though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah. '
    8: '⁸ But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in
      the desert plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. '
    9: '⁹ Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at
      Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. '
    10: '¹⁰ And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes,
      and he also slaughtered all the commanders of Judah in Riblah. '
    11: "¹¹ Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him\
      \ with bronze shackles and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until\
      \ the day of his death. \n"
    12: '¹² Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year
      of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard,
      who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ And he burned the house of the Lord, the king’s house, and all the houses
      of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire. '
    14: '¹⁴ So the entire army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard
      tore down all the walls around Jerusalem. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took into exile some of the
      poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the
      deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. '
    16: "¹⁶ But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the\
      \ land to be vinedressers and farmers. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the Lord and the
      stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans
      smashed to pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon. '
    18: '¹⁸ They also took the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans,
      and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service. '
    19: '¹⁹ The captain of the guard also took the bowls, the firepans, the basins,
      the pots, the lampstands, the pans, and the drink offering bowls, whatever was
      fine gold, and whatever was fine silver. '
    20: '²⁰ The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under
      the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord—the
      bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight. '
    21: '²¹ As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and
      it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, and hollow. '
    22: '²² Also, a capital of bronze was on top of it; and the height of each capital
      was five cubits, with latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around,
      all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates. '
    23: "²³ There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates numbered\
      \ a hundred on the latticework all around. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah
      the second priest, with the three officers of the temple. '
    25: '²⁵ He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the warriors,
      seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city, the scribe of the commander
      of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men from the people
      of the land who were found inside the city. '
    26: '²⁶ Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguards took them and brought them to
      the king of Babylon at Riblah. '
    27: "²⁷ Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death in Riblah in\
      \ the land of Hamath. So Judah was led into exile from its land. \n"
    28: '²⁸ These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took into exile: in the seventh
      year 3,023 Jews; '
    29: '²⁹ in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem; '
    30: "³⁰ in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of\
      \ the guard took into exile 745 Jewish people; there were 4,600 people in all.\
      \ \n"
    31: '³¹ Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin
      king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that
      Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor
      to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. '
    32: '³² Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the
      kings who were with him in Babylon. '
    33: '³³ So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king’s
      presence regularly all the days of his life. '
    34: ³⁴ And as his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king
      of Babylon, a portion for each day, all the days of his life until the day of
      his death.
