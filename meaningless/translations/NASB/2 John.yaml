2 John:
  1:
    1: '¹ The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and
      not only I, but also all who know the truth, '
    2: '² because of the truth which remains in us and will be with us forever: '
    3: "³ Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus\
      \ Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. \n"
    4: '⁴ I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in truth, just as
      we have received a commandment to do from the Father. '
    5: '⁵ Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment,
      but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. '
    6: "⁶ And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the\
      \ commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you are to walk\
      \ in it. \n"
    7: '⁷ For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge
      Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. '
    8: '⁸ Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that
      you may receive a full reward. '
    9: '⁹ Anyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ, does
      not have God; the one who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the
      Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive
      him into your house, and do not give him a greeting; '
    11: "¹¹ for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds. \n"
    12: "¹² Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with\
      \ paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your\
      \ joy may be made complete. \n"
    13: ¹³ The children of your chosen sister greet you.
