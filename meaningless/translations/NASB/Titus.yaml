Titus:
  1:
    1: '¹ Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith
      of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to
      godliness, '
    2: '² in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages
      ago, '
    3: "³ but at the proper time revealed His word in the proclamation with which\
      \ I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior; \n"
    4: "⁴ To Titus, my true son in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father\
      \ and Christ Jesus our Savior. \n"
    5: '⁵ For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains
      and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, '
    6: '⁶ namely, if any man is beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, having children
      who believe, not accused of indecent behavior or rebellion. '
    7: '⁷ For the overseer must be beyond reproach as God’s steward, not self-willed,
      not quick-tempered, not overindulging in wine, not a bully, not greedy for money, '
    8: '⁸ but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined, '
    9: "⁹ holding firmly the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching,\
      \ so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those\
      \ who contradict it. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially
      those of the circumcision, '
    11: '¹¹ who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching
      things they should not teach for the sake of dishonest gain. '
    12: '¹² One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars,
      evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” '
    13: '¹³ This testimony is true. For this reason reprimand them severely so that
      they may be sound in the faith, '
    14: '¹⁴ not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn
      away from the truth. '
    15: '¹⁵ To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving,
      nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. '
    16: ¹⁶ They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable
      and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.
  2:
    1: '¹ But as for you, proclaim the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. '
    2: "² Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith,\
      \ in love, in perseverance. \n"
    3: '³ Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious
      gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, '
    4: '⁴ so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love
      their children, '
    5: "⁵ to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own\
      \ husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored. \n"
    6: '⁶ Likewise urge the young men to be sensible; '
    7: '⁷ in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity
      in doctrine, dignified, '
    8: "⁸ sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put\
      \ to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. \n"
    9: '⁹ Urge slaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be pleasing,
      not argumentative, '
    10: "¹⁰ not stealing, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine\
      \ of God our Savior in every respect. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, '
    12: '¹² instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly,
      righteously, and in a godly manner in the present age, '
    13: '¹³ looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great
      God and Savior, Christ Jesus, '
    14: "¹⁴ who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify\
      \ for Himself a people for His own possession, eager for good deeds. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. No one is
      to disregard you.
  3:
    1: '¹ Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to
      be ready for every good deed, '
    2: '² to slander no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing every consideration
      for all people. '
    3: '³ For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various
      lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one
      another. '
    4: '⁴ But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, '
    5: '⁵ He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we did in righteousness, but
      in accordance with His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by
      the Holy Spirit, '
    6: '⁶ whom He richly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, '
    7: '⁷ so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to
      the hope of eternal life. '
    8: '⁸ This statement is trustworthy; and concerning these things I want you to
      speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage
      in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people. '
    9: '⁹ But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes
      about the Law, for they are useless and worthless. '
    10: '¹⁰ Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning, '
    11: "¹¹ knowing that such a person has deviated from what is right and is sinning,\
      \ being self-condemned. \n"
    12: '¹² When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me
      at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. '
    13: '¹³ Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing
      is lacking for them. '
    14: "¹⁴ Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs,\
      \ so that they will not be unproductive. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.\n\
      Grace be with you all."
