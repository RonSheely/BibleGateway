Job:
  1:
    1: '¹ There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless,
      upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. '
    2: '² Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. '
    3: '³ His possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred
      yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and very many servants; and that
      man was the greatest of all the men of the east. '
    4: '⁴ His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day,
      and they would send word and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with
      them. '
    5: "⁵ When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send word\
      \ to them and consecrate them, getting up early in the morning and offering\
      \ burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “Perhaps\
      \ my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before
      the Lord, and Satan also came among them. '
    7: '⁷ The Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the Lord
      and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.” '
    8: '⁸ The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is
      no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning
      away from evil.” '
    9: '⁹ Then Satan answered the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing? '
    10: '¹⁰ Have You not made a fence around him and his house and all that he has,
      on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have
      increased in the land. '
    11: '¹¹ But reach out with Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will certainly
      curse You to Your face.” '
    12: "¹² Then the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power;\
      \ only do not reach out and put your hand on him.” So Satan departed from the\
      \ presence of the Lord. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking
      wine in their oldest brother’s house, '
    14: '¹⁴ a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the female
      donkeys feeding beside them, '
    15: '¹⁵ and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also killed the servants
      with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” '
    16: '¹⁶ While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell
      from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and
      I alone have escaped to tell you.” '
    17: '¹⁷ While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed
      three units and made a raid on the camels and took them, and killed the servants
      with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” '
    18: '¹⁸ While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and
      your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, '
    19: "¹⁹ and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the\
      \ four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died,\
      \ and I alone have escaped to tell you.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; then he fell to the
      ground and worshiped. '
    21: "²¹ He said,\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked I shall return\
      \ there.\nThe Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.\nBlessed be the name of\
      \ the Lord.” \n"
    22: ²² Despite all this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God.
  2:
    1: '¹ Again, there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before
      the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord. '
    2: '² The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered
      the Lord and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.” '
    3: '³ The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is
      no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning
      away from evil. And he still holds firm to his integrity, although you incited
      Me against him to ruin him without cause.” '
    4: '⁴ Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has,
      he will give for his life. '
    5: '⁵ However, reach out with Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh;
      he will curse You to Your face!” '
    6: "⁶ So the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power, only spare his\
      \ life.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and struck Job with severe
      boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head. '
    8: "⁸ And Job took a piece of pottery to scrape himself while he was sitting in\
      \ the ashes. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold firm your integrity? Curse
      God and die!” '
    10: "¹⁰ But he said to her, “You are speaking as one of the foolish women speaks.\
      \ Shall we actually accept good from God but not accept adversity?” Despite\
      \ all this, Job did not sin with his lips. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now when Job’s three friends heard about all this adversity that had come
      upon him, they came, each one from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad
      the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together
      to come to sympathize with him and comfort him. '
    12: '¹² When they looked from a distance and did not recognize him, they raised
      their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe, and they threw dust over
      their heads toward the sky. '
    13: ¹³ Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights,
      with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.
  3:
    1: '¹ Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. '
    2: "² And Job said, \n"
    3: "³ “May the day on which I was to be born perish,\nAs well as the night which\
      \ said, ‘A boy is conceived.’\n"
    4: "⁴ May that day be darkness;\nMay God above not care for it,\nNor light shine\
      \ on it.\n"
    5: "⁵ May darkness and black gloom claim it;\nMay a cloud settle on it;\nMay the\
      \ blackness of the day terrify it.\n"
    6: "⁶ As for that night, may darkness seize it;\nMay it not rejoice among the\
      \ days of the year;\nMay it not come into the number of the months.\n"
    7: "⁷ Behold, may that night be barren;\nMay no joyful shout enter it.\n"
    8: "⁸ May those curse it who curse the day,\nWho are prepared to disturb Leviathan.\n"
    9: "⁹ May the stars of its twilight be darkened;\nMay it wait for light but have\
      \ none,\nAnd may it not see the breaking dawn;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Because it did not shut the opening of my mother’s womb,\nOr hide trouble\
      \ from my eyes. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Why did I not die at birth,\nCome out of the womb and pass away?\n"
    12: "¹² Why were the knees there in front of me,\nAnd why the breasts, that I\
      \ would nurse?\n"
    13: "¹³ For now I would have lain down and been quiet;\nI would have slept then,\
      \ I would have been at rest,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ With kings and counselors of the earth,\nWho rebuilt ruins for themselves;\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Or with rulers who had gold,\nWho were filling their houses with silver.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Or like a miscarriage which is hidden, I would not exist,\nAs infants\
      \ that never saw light.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ There the wicked cease from raging,\nAnd there the weary are at rest.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The prisoners are at ease together;\nThey do not hear the voice of the\
      \ taskmaster.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The small and the great are there,\nAnd the slave is free from his master.\
      \ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Why is light given to one burdened with grief,\nAnd life to the bitter\
      \ of soul,\n"
    21: "²¹ Who long for death, but there is none,\nAnd dig for it more than for hidden\
      \ treasures;\n"
    22: "²² Who are filled with jubilation,\nAnd rejoice when they find the grave?\n"
    23: "²³ Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,\nAnd whom God has shut\
      \ off?\n"
    24: "²⁴ For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,\nAnd my cries pour out\
      \ like water.\n"
    25: "²⁵ For what I fear comes upon me,\nAnd what I dread encounters me.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I am not at ease, nor am I quiet,\nAnd I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, \n"
    2: "² “If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient?\nBut who can\
      \ refrain from speaking?\n"
    3: "³ Behold, you have taught many,\nAnd you have strengthened weak hands.\n"
    4: "⁴ Your words have helped the stumbling to stand,\nAnd you have strengthened\
      \ feeble knees.\n"
    5: "⁵ But now it comes to you, and you are impatient;\nIt touches you, and you\
      \ are horrified.\n"
    6: "⁶ Is your fear of God not your confidence,\nAnd the integrity of your ways\
      \ your hope? \n"
    7: "⁷ “Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?\nOr where were the upright\
      \ destroyed?\n"
    8: "⁸ According to what I have seen, those who plow wrongdoing\nAnd those who\
      \ sow trouble harvest it.\n"
    9: "⁹ By the breath of God they perish,\nAnd by the blast of His anger they come\
      \ to an end.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion,\nAnd the teeth\
      \ of the young lions are broken out.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The lion perishes for lack of prey,\nAnd the cubs of the lioness are scattered.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² “Now a word was brought to me secretly,\nAnd my ear received a whisper\
      \ of it.\n"
    13: "¹³ Amid disquieting thoughts from visions of the night,\nWhen deep sleep\
      \ falls on people,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Dread came upon me, and trembling,\nAnd made all my bones shake.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then a spirit passed by my face;\nThe hair of my flesh stood up.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Something was standing still, but I could not recognize its appearance;\n\
      A form was before my eyes;\nThere was silence, then I heard a voice:\n"
    17: "¹⁷ ‘Can mankind be righteous before God?\nCan a man be pure before his Maker?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ He puts no trust even in His servants;\nAnd He accuses His angels of error.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ How much more those who live in houses of clay,\nWhose foundation is in\
      \ the dust,\nWho are crushed before the moth!\n"
    20: "²⁰ Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces;\nUnregarded, they\
      \ perish forever.\n"
    21: "²¹ Is their tent-cord not pulled out within them?\nThey die, yet without\
      \ wisdom.’"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Call now, is there anyone who will answer you?\nAnd to which of the holy\
      \ ones will you turn?\n"
    2: "² For irritation kills the fool,\nAnd jealousy brings death to the simple.\n"
    3: "³ I have seen the fool taking root,\nAnd I cursed his home immediately.\n"
    4: "⁴ His sons are far from safety,\nThey are also oppressed at the gate,\nAnd\
      \ there is no one to save them.\n"
    5: "⁵ The hungry devour his harvest\nAnd take it to a place of thorns,\nAnd the\
      \ schemer is eager for their wealth.\n"
    6: "⁶ For disaster does not come from the dust,\nNor does trouble sprout from\
      \ the ground,\n"
    7: "⁷ For man is born for trouble,\nAs sparks fly upward. \n"
    8: "⁸ “But as for me, I would seek God,\nAnd I would make my plea before God,\n"
    9: "⁹ Who does great and unsearchable things,\nWonders without number.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He gives rain on the earth,\nAnd sends water on the fields,\n"
    11: "¹¹ So that He sets on high those who are lowly,\nAnd those who mourn are\
      \ lifted to safety.\n"
    12: "¹² He frustrates the schemes of the shrewd,\nSo that their hands cannot attain\
      \ success.\n"
    13: "¹³ He captures the wise by their own cleverness,\nAnd the advice of the cunning\
      \ is quickly thwarted.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ By day they meet with darkness,\nAnd grope at noon as in the night.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ But He saves from the sword of their mouth,\nAnd the poor from the hand\
      \ of the strong.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ So the helpless has hope,\nAnd injustice has shut its mouth. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Behold, happy is the person whom God disciplines,\nSo do not reject the\
      \ discipline of the Almighty.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For He inflicts pain, and gives relief;\nHe wounds, but His hands also\
      \ heal.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ In six troubles He will save you;\nEven in seven, evil will not touch\
      \ you.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In famine He will redeem you from death,\nAnd in war, from the power of\
      \ the sword.\n"
    21: "²¹ You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,\nAnd you will not be\
      \ afraid of violence when it comes.\n"
    22: "²² You will laugh at violence and hunger,\nAnd you will not be afraid of\
      \ wild animals.\n"
    23: "²³ For you will be in league with the stones of the field,\nAnd the animals\
      \ of the field will be at peace with you.\n"
    24: "²⁴ You will know that your tent is secure,\nFor you will visit your home\
      \ and have nothing missing.\n"
    25: "²⁵ You will also know that your descendants will be many,\nAnd your offspring\
      \ as the grass of the earth.\n"
    26: "²⁶ You will come to the grave at a ripe age,\nLike the stacking of grain\
      \ in its season.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Behold this; we have investigated it, and so it is.\nHear it, and know\
      \ for yourself.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Then Job responded, \n"
    2: "² “Oh if only my grief were actually weighed\nAnd laid in the balances together\
      \ with my disaster!\n"
    3: "³ For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;\nFor that reason\
      \ my words have been rash.\n"
    4: "⁴ For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,\nMy spirit drinks their poison;\n\
      The terrors of God line up against me.\n"
    5: "⁵ Does the wild donkey bray over his grass,\nOr does the ox low over his feed?\n"
    6: "⁶ Can something tasteless be eaten without salt,\nOr is there any taste in\
      \ the juice of an alkanet plant?\n"
    7: "⁷ My soul refuses to touch them;\nThey are like loathsome food to me. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Oh, that my request might come to pass,\nAnd that God would grant my hope!\n"
    9: "⁹ Oh, that God would decide to crush me,\nThat He would let loose His hand\
      \ and cut me off!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ But it is still my comfort,\nAnd I rejoice in unsparing pain,\nThat I\
      \ have not denied the words of the Holy One.\n"
    11: "¹¹ What is my strength, that I should wait?\nAnd what is my end, that I should\
      \ endure?\n"
    12: "¹² Is my strength the strength of stones,\nOr is my flesh bronze?\n"
    13: "¹³ Is it that my help is not within me,\nAnd that a good outcome is driven\
      \ away from me? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend;\nSo\
      \ that he does not abandon the fear of the Almighty.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi,\nLike the torrents of\
      \ wadis which drain away,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Which are darkened because of ice,\nAnd into which the snow melts.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ When they dry up, they vanish;\nWhen it is hot, they disappear from their\
      \ place.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ The paths of their course wind along,\nThey go up into wasteland and perish.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ The caravans of Tema looked,\nThe travelers of Sheba hoped for them.\n"
    20: "²⁰ They were put to shame, for they had trusted,\nThey came there and were\
      \ humiliated.\n"
    21: "²¹ Indeed, you have now become such,\nYou see terrors and are afraid.\n"
    22: "²² Have I said, ‘Give me something,’\nOr, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your\
      \ wealth,’\n"
    23: "²³ Or, ‘Save me from the hand of the enemy,’\nOr, ‘Redeem me from the hand\
      \ of the tyrants’? \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Teach me, and I will be silent;\nAnd show me how I have done wrong.\n"
    25: "²⁵ How painful are honest words!\nBut what does your argument prove?\n"
    26: "²⁶ Do you intend to rebuke my words,\nWhen the words of one in despair belong\
      \ to the wind?\n"
    27: "²⁷ You would even cast lots for the orphans,\nAnd barter over your friend.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Now please look at me,\nAnd see if I am lying to your face.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Please turn away, let there be no injustice;\nTurn away, my righteousness\
      \ is still in it.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Is there injustice on my tongue?\nDoes my palate not discern disasters?"
  7:
    1: "¹ “Is a person not forced to labor on earth,\nAnd are his days not like the\
      \ days of a hired worker?\n"
    2: "² As a slave pants for the shade,\nAnd as a hired worker who eagerly waits\
      \ for his wages,\n"
    3: "³ So I am allotted worthless months,\nAnd nights of trouble are apportioned\
      \ to me.\n"
    4: "⁴ When I lie down, I say,\n‘When shall I arise?’\nBut the night continues,\n\
      And I am continually tossing until dawn.\n"
    5: "⁵ My flesh is clothed with maggots and a crust of dirt,\nMy skin hardens and\
      \ oozes.\n"
    6: "⁶ My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,\nAnd they come to an end without\
      \ hope. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Remember that my life is a mere breath;\nMy eye will not see goodness again.\n"
    8: "⁸ The eye of him who sees me will no longer look at me;\nYour eyes will be\
      \ on me, but I will not exist.\n"
    9: "⁹ When a cloud vanishes, it is gone;\nIn the same way one who goes down to\
      \ Sheol does not come up.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He will not return to his house again,\nNor will his place know about\
      \ him anymore. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;\nI will speak in the anguish\
      \ of my spirit,\nI will complain in the bitterness of my soul.\n"
    12: "¹² Am I the sea, or the sea monster,\nThat You set a guard over me?\n"
    13: "¹³ If I say, ‘My couch will comfort me,\nMy bed will ease my complaint,’\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then You frighten me with dreams,\nAnd terrify me by visions,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So that my soul would choose suffocation,\nDeath rather than my pains.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I waste away; I will not live forever.\nLeave me alone, for my days are\
      \ only a breath.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ What is man that You exalt him,\nAnd that You are concerned about him,\n"
    18: "¹⁸ That You examine him every morning\nAnd put him to the test every moment?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Will You never turn Your gaze away from me,\nNor leave me alone until\
      \ I swallow my spittle?\n"
    20: "²⁰ Have I sinned? What have I done to You,\nWatcher of mankind?\nWhy have\
      \ You made me Your target,\nSo that I am a burden to myself?\n"
    21: "²¹ Why then do You not forgive my wrongdoing\nAnd take away my guilt?\nFor\
      \ now I will lie down in the dust;\nAnd You will search for me, but I will no\
      \ longer exist.”"
  8:
    1: "¹ Then Bildad the Shuhite responded, \n"
    2: "² “How long will you say these things,\nAnd the words of your mouth be a mighty\
      \ wind?\n"
    3: "³ Does God pervert justice?\nOr does the Almighty pervert what is right?\n"
    4: "⁴ If your sons sinned against Him,\nThen He turned them over to the power\
      \ of their wrongdoing.\n"
    5: "⁵ If you will search for God\nAnd implore the compassion of the Almighty,\n"
    6: "⁶ If you are pure and upright,\nSurely now He will stir Himself for you\n\
      And restore your righteous estate.\n"
    7: "⁷ Though your beginning was insignificant,\nYet your end will increase greatly.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Please inquire of past generations,\nAnd consider the things searched out\
      \ by their fathers.\n"
    9: "⁹ For we are only of yesterday and know nothing,\nBecause our days on earth\
      \ are as a shadow.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Will they not teach you and tell you,\nAnd bring forth words from their\
      \ minds? \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Can papyrus grow tall without a marsh?\nCan the rushes grow without water?\n"
    12: "¹² While it is still green and not cut down,\nYet it withers before any other\
      \ plant.\n"
    13: "¹³ So are the paths of all who forget God;\nAnd the hope of the godless will\
      \ perish,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ His confidence is fragile,\nAnd his trust is a spider’s web.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He depends on his house, but it does not stand;\nHe holds on to it, but\
      \ it does not endure.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He flourishes before the sun,\nAnd his shoots spread out over his garden.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ His roots wrap around a rock pile,\nHe grasps a house of stones.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ If he is removed from his place,\nThen it will deny him, saying, ‘I never\
      \ saw you.’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Behold, this is the joy of His way;\nAnd out of the dust others will spring.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Behold, God will not reject a person of integrity,\nNor will He help evildoers.\n"
    21: "²¹ He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,\nAnd your lips with joyful\
      \ shouting.\n"
    22: "²² Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,\nAnd the tent of the wicked\
      \ will no longer exist.”"
  9:
    1: "¹ Then Job responded, \n"
    2: "² “In truth I know that this is so;\nBut how can a person be in the right\
      \ with God?\n"
    3: "³ If one wished to dispute with Him,\nHe could not answer Him once in a thousand\
      \ times.\n"
    4: "⁴ Wise in heart and mighty in strength,\nWho has defied Him without harm?\n"
    5: "⁵ It is God who removes the mountains, and they do not know how,\nWhen He\
      \ overturns them in His anger.\n"
    6: "⁶ It is He who shakes the earth from its place,\nAnd its pillars tremble;\n"
    7: "⁷ Who commands the sun not to shine,\nAnd puts a seal on the stars;\n"
    8: "⁸ Who alone stretches out the heavens,\nAnd tramples down the waves of the\
      \ sea;\n"
    9: "⁹ Who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,\nAnd the constellations of\
      \ the south.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ It is He who does great things, the unfathomable,\nAnd wondrous works\
      \ without number.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If He were to pass by me, I would not see Him;\nWere He to move past me,\

    16: "¹⁶ If I called and He answered me,\nI could not believe that He was listening\

    10: "¹⁰ If He passes by or apprehends people,\nOr calls an assembly, who can restrain\

    12: "¹² They make night into day, saying,\n‘The light is near,’ in the presence\

    13: "¹³ If I hope for Sheol as my home,\nI make my bed in the darkness;\n"
    14: "¹⁴ If I call to the grave, ‘You are my father’;\nTo the maggot, ‘my mother\

    15: "¹⁵ Where then is my hope?\nAnd who looks at my hope?\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Will it go down with me to Sheol?\nShall we together go down into the\

  18:
    1: "¹ Then Bildad the Shuhite responded, \n"
    2: "² “How long will you hunt for words?\nShow understanding, and then we can\

    3: "³ Why are we regarded as animals,\nAs stupid in your eyes?\n"
    4: "⁴ You who tear yourself in your anger—\nShould the earth be abandoned for\

    5: "⁵ “Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out,\nAnd the spark from his fire\

    6: "⁶ The light in his tent is darkened,\nAnd his lamp goes out above him.\n"
    7: "⁷ His vigorous stride is shortened,\nAnd his own plan brings him down.\n"
    8: "⁸ For he is thrown into the net by his own feet,\nAnd he steps on the webbing.\n"
    9: "⁹ A snare seizes him by the heel,\nAnd a trap snaps shut on him.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A noose for him is hidden in the ground,\nAnd a trap for him on the pathway.\n"
    11: "¹¹ All around sudden terrors frighten him,\nAnd harass him at every step.\n"
    12: "¹² His strength is famished,\nAnd disaster is ready at his side.\n"
    13: "¹³ It devours parts of his skin,\nThe firstborn of death devours his limbs.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is torn from the security of his tent,\nAnd they march him before the\
      \ king of terrors.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Nothing of his dwells in his tent;\nBrimstone is scattered on his home.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ His roots are dried below,\nAnd his branch withers above.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The memory of him perishes from the earth,\nAnd he has no name abroad.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ He is driven from light into darkness,\nAnd chased from the inhabited\

    19: "¹⁹ He has no offspring or descendants among his people,\nNor any survivor\

    20: "²⁰ Those in the west are appalled at his fate,\nAnd those in the east are\

    21: "²¹ Certainly these are the dwellings of the wicked,\nAnd this is the place\

  19:
    1: "¹ Then Job responded, \n"
    2: "² “How long will you torment me\nAnd crush me with words?\n"
    3: "³ These ten times you have insulted me;\nYou are not ashamed to wrong me.\n"
    4: "⁴ Even if I have truly done wrong,\nMy error stays with me.\n"
    5: "⁵ If indeed you exalt yourselves against me\nAnd prove my disgrace to me,\n"
    6: "⁶ Know then that God has wronged me\nAnd has surrounded me with His net. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Behold, I cry, ‘Violence!’ but I get no answer;\nI shout for help, but\

    9: "⁹ He has stripped my honor from me\nAnd removed the crown from my head.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone;\nAnd He has uprooted my\

    11: "¹¹ He has also kindled His anger against me\nAnd considered me as His enemy.\n"
    12: "¹² His troops come together\nAnd build up their way against me\nAnd camp\

    13: "¹³ “He has removed my brothers far from me,\nAnd my acquaintances have completely\

    15: "¹⁵ Those who live in my house and my servant women consider me a stranger.\n\
      I am a foreigner in their sight.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I call to my servant, but he does not answer;\nI have to implore his favor\
      \ with my mouth.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ My breath is offensive to my wife,\nAnd I am loathsome to my own brothers.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Even young children despise me;\nI stand up and they speak against me.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ All my associates loathe me,\nAnd those I love have turned against me.\n"
    20: "²⁰ My bone clings to my skin and my flesh,\nAnd I have escaped only by the\

    28: "²⁸ If you say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’\nAnd ‘What pretext for a case\

    29: "²⁹ Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves,\nFor wrath brings the punishment\
      \ of the sword,\nSo that you may know there is judgment.”"
  20:
    1: "¹ Then Zophar the Naamathite responded, \n"
    2: "² “Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond,\nEven because of my\

    4: "⁴ Do you know this from ancient times,\nFrom the establishment of mankind\
      \ on earth,\n"
    5: "⁵ That the rejoicing of the wicked is short,\nAnd the joy of the godless momentary?\n"
    6: "⁶ Though his arrogance reaches the heavens,\nAnd his head touches the clouds,\n"
    7: "⁷ He perishes forever like his refuse;\nThose who have seen him will say,\
      \ ‘Where is he?’\n"
    8: "⁸ He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him;\nLike a vision of\
      \ the night he is chased away.\n"
    9: "⁹ The eye which saw him sees him no longer,\nAnd his place no longer beholds\

    10: "¹⁰ His sons favor the poor,\nAnd his hands give back his wealth.\n"

    12: "¹² “Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth\nAnd he hides it under his tongue,\n"
    13: "¹³ Though he desires it and will not let it go,\nBut holds it in his mouth,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yet his food in his stomach is changed\nTo the venom of cobras within\
      \ him.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He swallows riches,\nBut will vomit them up;\nGod will expel them from\
      \ his belly.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He sucks the poison of cobras;\nThe viper’s tongue kills him.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He does not look at the streams,\nThe rivers flowing with honey and curds.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ He returns the product of his labor\nAnd cannot swallow it;\nAs to the\
      \ riches of his trading,\nHe cannot even enjoy them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ For he has oppressed and neglected the poor;\nHe has seized a house which\

    20: "²⁰ “Because he knew no quiet within him,\nHe does not retain anything he\

    21: "²¹ Nothing remains for him to devour,\nTherefore his prosperity does not\

    22: "²² In the fullness of his excess he will be cramped;\nThe hand of everyone\

    23: "²³ When he fills his belly,\nGod will send His fierce anger on him\nAnd rain\
      \ it on him while he is eating.\n"
    24: "²⁴ He may flee from the iron weapon,\nBut the bronze bow will pierce him.\n"
    25: "²⁵ It is drawn and comes out of his back,\nEven the flashing point from his\
      \ gallbladder;\nTerrors come upon him,\n"
    26: "²⁶ Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures,\nAnd unfanned\
      \ fire will devour him;\nIt will consume the survivor in his tent.\n"
    27: "²⁷ The heavens will reveal his guilt,\nAnd the earth will rise up against\

    29: "²⁹ This is a wicked person’s portion from God,\nThe inheritance decreed to\

  21:
    1: "¹ Then Job responded, \n"
    2: "² “Listen carefully to my speech,\nAnd let this be your way of consolation.\n"
    3: "³ Bear with me that I may speak;\nThen after I have spoken, you may mock me.\n"
    4: "⁴ As for me, is my complaint to a mortal?\nOr why should I not be impatient?\n"
    5: "⁵ Look at me, and be astonished,\nAnd put your hand over your mouth.\n"
    6: "⁶ Even when I remember, I am disturbed,\nAnd horror takes hold of my flesh.\n"
    7: "⁷ Why do the wicked still live,\nGrow old, and also become very powerful?\n"
    8: "⁸ Their descendants endure with them in their sight,\nAnd their offspring\

    9: "⁹ Their houses are safe from fear,\nAnd the rod of God is not on them.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ His ox mates without fail;\nHis cow calves and does not miscarry.\n"
    11: "¹¹ They send out their boys like the flock,\nAnd their children dance.\n"
    12: "¹² They sing with the tambourine and harp,\nAnd rejoice at the sound of the\
      \ flute.\n"
    13: "¹³ They spend their days in prosperity,\nAnd suddenly they go down to Sheol.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Yet they say to God, ‘Go away from us!\nWe do not even desire the knowledge\

    15: "¹⁵ Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him,\nAnd what would we gain\
      \ if we plead with Him?’\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand;\nThe advice of the wicked\

    17: "¹⁷ “How often is the lamp of the wicked put out,\nOr does their disaster\
      \ fall on them?\nDoes God apportion destruction in His anger?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Are they as straw before the wind,\nAnd like chaff which the storm carries\
      \ away?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ You say, ‘God saves up a person’s wrongdoing for his sons.’\nLet God repay\
      \ him so that he may know it.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Let his own eyes see his destruction,\nAnd let him drink of the wrath\
      \ of the Almighty.\n"
    21: "²¹ For what does he care about his household after him,\nWhen the number\
      \ of his months is at an end?\n"
    22: "²² Can anyone teach God knowledge,\nIn that He judges those on high?\n"
    23: "²³ One dies in his full strength,\nBeing wholly undisturbed and at ease;\n"
    24: "²⁴ His sides are filled with fat,\nAnd the marrow of his bones is wet,\n"
    25: "²⁵ While another dies with a bitter soul,\nNever even tasting anything good.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Together they lie down in the dust,\nAnd maggots cover them. \n"
    27: "²⁷ “Behold, I know your thoughts,\nAnd the plots you devise against me.\n"
    28: "²⁸ For you say, ‘Where is the house of the nobleman,\nAnd where is the tent,\

    29: "²⁹ Have you not asked travelers,\nAnd do you not examine their evidence?\n"
    30: "³⁰ For the wicked person is spared a day of disaster;\nThey are led away\

    31: "³¹ Who confronts him with his actions,\nAnd who repays him for what he has\
      \ done?\n"
    32: "³² When he is carried to the grave,\nPeople will keep watch over his tomb.\n"
    33: "³³ The clods of the valley will gently cover him;\nMoreover, all mankind\
      \ will follow after him,\nWhile countless others go before him.\n"
    34: "³⁴ So how dare you give me empty comfort?\nFor your answers remain nothing\
      \ but falsehood!”"
  22:
    1: "¹ Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, \n"
    2: "² “Can a strong man be of use to God,\nOr a wise one be useful to himself?\n"
    3: "³ Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous,\nOr gain if you\
      \ make your ways blameless?\n"
    4: "⁴ Is it because of your reverence that He punishes you,\nThat He enters into\
      \ judgment against you?\n"
    5: "⁵ Is your wickedness not abundant,\nAnd is there no end to your guilty deeds?\n"
    6: "⁶ For you have seized pledges from your brothers without cause,\nAnd stripped\
      \ people naked.\n"
    7: "⁷ You have given the weary no water to drink,\nAnd you have withheld bread\
      \ from the hungry.\n"
    8: "⁸ But the earth belongs to the powerful man,\nAnd the one who is honorable\
      \ dwells on it.\n"
    9: "⁹ You have sent widows away empty,\nAnd the strength of orphans has been crushed.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Therefore traps surround you,\nAnd sudden dread terrifies you,\n"
    11: "¹¹ Or darkness, so that you cannot see,\nAnd a flood of water covers you.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² “Is God not in the height of heaven?\nLook also at the highest stars,\
      \ how high they are!\n"
    13: "¹³ But you say, ‘What does God know?\nCan He judge through the thick darkness?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see;\nAnd He walks\
      \ on the vault of heaven.’\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Will you keep to the ancient path\nWhich wicked people have walked,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Who were snatched away before their time,\nWhose foundations were washed\
      \ away by a river?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They said to God, ‘Go away from us!’\nAnd ‘What can the Almighty do to\

    18: "¹⁸ Yet He filled their houses with good things;\nBut the advice of the wicked\

    19: "¹⁹ The righteous see and are glad,\nAnd the innocent mock them, saying,\n"
    20: "²⁰ ‘Truly our enemies are eliminated,\nAnd fire has consumed their abundance.’\

    23: "²³ If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored;\nIf you remove injustice\
      \ far from your tent,\n"
    24: "²⁴ And put your gold in the dust,\nAnd the gold of Ophir among the stones\
      \ of the brooks,\n"
    25: "²⁵ Then the Almighty will be your gold\nAnd abundant silver to you.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For then you will take pleasure in the Almighty\nAnd lift up your face\
      \ to God.\n"
    27: "²⁷ You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;\nAnd you will pay your vows.\n"
    28: "²⁸ You will also decide something, and it will be established for you;\n\
      And light will shine on your ways.\n"
    29: "²⁹ When they have brought you low, you will speak with confidence,\nAnd He\

    30: "³⁰ He will rescue one who is not innocent,\nAnd he will be rescued due to\

  23:
    1: "¹ Then Job responded, \n"
    2: "² “Even today my complaint is rebellion;\nHis hand is heavy despite my groaning.\n"
    3: "³ Oh that I knew how to find Him,\nThat I might come to His home!\n"
    4: "⁴ I would present my case before Him\nAnd fill my mouth with arguments.\n"
    5: "⁵ I would learn the words which He would answer,\nAnd perceive what He would\

    10: "¹⁰ But He knows the way I take;\nWhen He has put me to the test, I will come\

    11: "¹¹ My foot has held on to His path;\nI have kept His way and not turned aside.\n"
    12: "¹² I have not failed the command of His lips;\nI have treasured the words\

    13: "¹³ But He is unique, and who can make Him turn?\nWhatever His soul desires,\
      \ He does it.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For He carries out what is destined for me,\nAnd many such destinies are\
      \ with Him.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore, I would be terrified at His presence;\nWhen I consider this,\
      \ I am frightened of Him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ It is God who has made my heart faint,\nAnd the Almighty who has terrified\

    17: "¹⁷ But I am not destroyed by darkness,\nNor by deep gloom which covers me."
  24:
    1: "¹ “Why are times not stored up by the Almighty,\nAnd why do those who know\

    5: "⁵ Behold, like wild donkeys in the wilderness\nThey go out scavenging for\
      \ food in their activity,\nAs bread for their children in the desert.\n"
    6: "⁶ They harvest their feed in the field\nAnd glean the vineyard of the wicked.\n"
    7: "⁷ They spend the night naked, without clothing,\nAnd have no covering against\
      \ the cold.\n"
    8: "⁸ They are wet from the mountain rains,\nAnd they hug the rock for lack of\
      \ a shelter.\n"
    9: "⁹ Others snatch an orphan from the breast,\nAnd they seize it as a pledge\
      \ against the poor.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The poor move about naked without clothing,\nAnd they carry sheaves, while\

    11: "¹¹ Within the walls they produce oil;\nThey tread wine presses but go thirsty.\n"
    12: "¹² From the city people groan,\nAnd the souls of the wounded cry for help;\n\

    14: "¹⁴ The murderer arises at dawn;\nHe kills the poor and the needy,\nAnd at\
      \ night he is like a thief.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight,\nSaying, ‘No eye will see\

    16: "¹⁶ In the darkness they dig into houses,\nThey shut themselves up by day;\n\
      They do not know the light.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness,\nFor he is familiar\

    20: "²⁰ A mother will forget him;\nThe maggot feeds sweetly until he is no longer\

    6: "⁶ How much less man, that maggot,\nAnd a son of man, that worm!”"
  26:

    7: '⁷ It came about after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, that the Lord
      said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you and against your
      two friends, because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy, as My servant

    8: '⁸ Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to
      My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant
      Job will pray for you. For I will accept him so as not to do with you as your
      foolishness deserves, because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy,
      as My servant Job has.” '
    9: "⁹ So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went\
      \ and did as the Lord told them; and the Lord accepted Job. \n"

      with him and comforted him for all the adversities that the Lord had brought
      on him. And each one gave him a piece of money, and each a ring of gold. '
    12: '¹² The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he
      had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and
      a thousand female donkeys. '
