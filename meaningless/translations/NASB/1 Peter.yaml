1 Peter:
  1:
    1: "¹ Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,\nTo those who reside as strangers, scattered\
      \ throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen "
    2: "² according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work\
      \ of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace\
      \ and peace be multiplied to you. \n"
    3: '³ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to
      His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the
      resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, '
    4: '⁴ to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and will not
      fade away, reserved in heaven for you, '
    5: '⁵ who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready
      to be revealed in the last time. '
    6: '⁶ In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary,
      you have been distressed by various trials, '
    7: '⁷ so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which perishes
      though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at
      the revelation of Jesus Christ; '
    8: '⁸ and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see
      Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and
      full of glory, '
    9: "⁹ obtaining as the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would
      come to you made careful searches and inquiries, '
    11: '¹¹ seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was
      indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. '
    12: "¹² It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you,\
      \ in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached\
      \ the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels\
      \ long to look. \n"
    13: '¹³ Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, set your
      hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus
      Christ. '
    14: '¹⁴ As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were
      yours in your ignorance, '
    15: '¹⁵ but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your
      behavior; '
    16: "¹⁶ because it is written: “You shall be holy, for I am holy.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each
      one’s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; '
    18: '¹⁸ knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver
      or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, '
    19: '¹⁹ but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood
      of Christ. '
    20: '²⁰ For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared
      in these last times for the sake of you '
    21: "²¹ who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and\
      \ gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. \n"
    22: '²² Since you have purified your souls in obedience to the truth for a sincere
      love of the brothers and sisters, fervently love one another from the heart, '
    23: '²³ for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable,
      that is, through the living and enduring word of God. '
    24: "²⁴ For,\n“All flesh is like grass,\nAnd all its glory is like the flower\
      \ of grass.\nThe grass withers,\nAnd the flower falls off,\n"
    25: "²⁵ But the word of the Lord endures forever.”\nAnd this is the word which\
      \ was preached to you."
  2:
    1: '¹ Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and
      envy and all slander, '
    2: '² and like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by
      it you may grow in respect to salvation, '
    3: "³ if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. \n"
    4: '⁴ And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by people,
      but is choice and precious in the sight of God, '
    5: '⁵ you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for
      a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God
      through Jesus Christ. '
    6: "⁶ For this is contained in Scripture:\n“Behold, I am laying in Zion a choice\
      \ stone, a precious cornerstone,\nAnd the one who believes in Him will not be\
      \ put to shame.” \n"
    7: "⁷ This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for unbelievers,\n\
      “A stone which the builders rejected,\nThis became the chief cornerstone,” \n"
    8: "⁸ and,\n“A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense”;\nfor they stumble because\
      \ they are disobedient to the word, and to this they were also appointed. \n"
    9: '⁹ But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people
      for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who
      has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; '
    10: "¹⁰ for you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God; you\
      \ had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and strangers to abstain from fleshly
      lusts, which wage war against the soul. '
    12: "¹² Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing\
      \ in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds,\
      \ as they observe them, glorify God on the day of visitation. \n"
    13: '¹³ Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether
      to a king as the one in authority, '
    14: '¹⁴ or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the
      praise of those who do right. '
    15: '¹⁵ For such is the will of God, that by doing right you silence the ignorance
      of foolish people. '
    16: '¹⁶ Act as free people, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil,
      but use it as bond-servants of God. '
    17: "¹⁷ Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to those
      who are good and gentle, but also to those who are harsh. '
    19: '¹⁹ For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person
      endures grief when suffering unjustly. '
    20: "²⁰ For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you\
      \ endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it\
      \ you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God. \n"
    21: '²¹ For you have been called for this purpose, because Christ also suffered
      for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in His steps, '
    22: '²² He who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth; '
    23: '²³ and while being abusively insulted, He did not insult in return; while
      suffering, He did not threaten, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges
      righteously; '
    24: '²⁴ and He Himself brought our sins in His body up on the cross, so that we
      might die to sin and live for righteousness; by His wounds you were healed. '
    25: ²⁵ For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned
      to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
  3:
    1: '¹ In the same way, you wives, be subject to your own husbands so that even
      if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won over without a word
      by the behavior of their wives, '
    2: '² as they observe your pure and respectful behavior. '
    3: '³ Your adornment must not be merely the external—braiding the hair, wearing
      gold jewelry, or putting on apparel; '
    4: '⁴ but it should be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality
      of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. '
    5: '⁵ For in this way the holy women of former times, who hoped in God, also used
      to adorn themselves, being subject to their own husbands, '
    6: "⁶ just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; and you have proved to be\
      \ her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way,\
      \ as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow\
      \ heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. \n"
    8: '⁸ To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, loving, compassionate,
      and humble; '
    9: '⁹ not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing
      instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you would inherit a blessing. '
    10: "¹⁰ For,\n“The one who desires life, to love and see good days,\nMust keep\
      \ his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He must turn away from evil and do good;\nHe must seek peace and pursue\
      \ it.\n"
    12: "¹² For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous,\nAnd His ears attend\
      \ to their prayer,\nBut the face of the Lord is against evildoers.” \n"
    13: '¹³ And who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? '
    14: '¹⁴ But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed.
      And do not fear their intimidation, and do not be in dread, '
    15: '¹⁵ but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make
      a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in
      you, but with gentleness and respect; '
    16: '¹⁶ and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered,
      those who disparage your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. '
    17: '¹⁷ For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing
      what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. '
    18: '¹⁸ For Christ also suffered for sins once for all time, the just for the
      unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh,
      but made alive in the spirit; '
    19: '¹⁹ in which He also went and made proclamation to the spirits in prison, '
    20: '²⁰ who once were disobedient when the patience of God kept waiting in the
      days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight
      persons, were brought safely through the water. '
    21: '²¹ Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from
      the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection
      of Jesus Christ, '
    22: ²² who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels
      and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.
  4:
    1: '¹ Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with
      the same purpose, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from
      sin, '
    2: '² so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts,
      but for the will of God. '
    3: '³ For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the
      desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of indecent behavior, lusts,
      drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and wanton idolatries. '
    4: '⁴ In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them in the same
      excesses of debauchery, and they slander you; '
    5: '⁵ but they will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and
      the dead. '
    6: "⁶ For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are\
      \ dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as people, they may live in\
      \ the spirit according to the will of God. \n"
    7: '⁷ The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober
      spirit for the purpose of prayer. '
    8: '⁸ Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers
      a multitude of sins. '
    9: '⁹ Be hospitable to one another without complaint. '
    10: '¹⁰ As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another
      as good stewards of the multifaceted grace of God. '
    11: "¹¹ Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking actual words of God;\
      \ whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God\
      \ supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,\
      \ to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    12: '¹² Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes
      upon you for your testing, as though something strange were happening to you; '
    13: '¹³ but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing,
      so that at the revelation of His glory you may also rejoice and be overjoyed. '
    14: '¹⁴ If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the
      Spirit of glory, and of God, rests upon you. '
    15: '¹⁵ Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer,
      or a troublesome meddler; '
    16: '¹⁶ but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is
      to glorify God in this name. '
    17: '¹⁷ For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if
      it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey
      the gospel of God? '
    18: '¹⁸ And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become
      of the godless man and the sinner? '
    19: ¹⁹ Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God are to entrust
      their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.
  5:
    1: '¹ Therefore, I urge elders among you, as your fellow elder and a witness of
      the sufferings of Christ, and one who is also a fellow partaker of the glory
      that is to be revealed: '
    2: '² shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion
      but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not with greed but with eagerness; '
    3: '³ nor yet as domineering over those assigned to your care, but by proving
      to be examples to the flock. '
    4: '⁴ And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown
      of glory. '
    5: "⁵ You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe\
      \ yourselves with humility toward one another, because God is opposed to the\
      \ proud, but He gives grace to the humble. \n"
    6: '⁶ Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may
      exalt you at the proper time, '
    7: '⁷ having cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares about you. '
    8: '⁸ Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around
      like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. '
    9: '⁹ So resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of
      suffering are being accomplished by your brothers and sisters who are in the
      world. '
    10: '¹⁰ After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who
      called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen,
      and establish you. '
    11: "¹¹ To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    12: '¹² Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written
      to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God.
      Stand firm in it! '
    13: '¹³ She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings,
      and so does my son, Mark. '
    14: "¹⁴ Greet one another with a kiss of love.\nPeace be to you all who are in\
      \ Christ."
