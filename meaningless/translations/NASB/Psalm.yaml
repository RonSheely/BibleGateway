    29: "²⁹ So they ate and were well filled,\nAnd He satisfied their longing.\n"

    36: "³⁶ But they flattered Him with their mouth\nAnd lied to Him with their tongue.\n"
    37: "³⁷ For their heart was not steadfast toward Him,\nNor were they faithful\
      \ with His covenant.\n"
    38: "³⁸ But He, being compassionate, forgave their wrongdoing and did not destroy\
      \ them;\nAnd often He restrained His anger\nAnd did not stir up all His wrath.\n"
    39: "³⁹ So He remembered that they were only flesh,\nA wind that passes and does\
      \ not return. \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness\nAnd grieved Him\
      \ in the desert!\n"

    43: "⁴³ When He performed His signs in Egypt\nAnd His marvels in the field of\
      \ Zoan,\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ And turned their rivers to blood,\nAnd their streams, so that they could\
      \ not drink.\n"
    45: "⁴⁵ He sent swarms of flies among them that devoured them,\nAnd frogs that\
      \ destroyed them.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ He also gave their crops to the grasshopper\nAnd the product of their\
      \ labor to the locust.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ He destroyed their vines with hailstones\nAnd their sycamore trees with\
      \ frost.\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ He also turned their cattle over to the hailstones,\nAnd their herds to\
      \ bolts of lightning.\n"
    49: "⁴⁹ He sent His burning anger upon them,\nFury and indignation and trouble,\n\
      A band of destroying angels.\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ He leveled a path for His anger;\nHe did not spare their souls from death,\n\
      But turned their lives over to the plague,\n"
    51: "⁵¹ And struck all the firstborn in Egypt,\nThe first and best of their vigor\
      \ in the tents of Ham.\n"
    52: "⁵² But He led His own people out like sheep,\nAnd guided them in the wilderness\
      \ like a flock;\n"
    53: "⁵³ He led them safely, so that they did not fear;\nBut the sea engulfed their\
      \ enemies. \n"
    54: "⁵⁴ So He brought them to His holy land,\nTo this hill country which His right\
      \ hand had gained.\n"
    55: "⁵⁵ He also drove out the nations from them\nAnd apportioned them as an inheritance\
      \ by measurement,\nAnd had the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God\nAnd did not keep\
      \ His testimonies,\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers;\nThey turned\
      \ aside like a treacherous bow.\n"
    58: "⁵⁸ For they provoked Him with their high places\nAnd moved Him to jealousy\
      \ with their carved images.\n"
    59: "⁵⁹ When God heard them, He was filled with wrath\nAnd He utterly rejected\
      \ Israel;\n"
    60: "⁶⁰ So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh,\nThe tent which He\
      \ had pitched among people,\n"
    61: "⁶¹ And He gave up His strength to captivity\nAnd His glory into the hand\
      \ of the enemy.\n"
    62: "⁶² He also turned His people over to the sword,\nAnd was filled with wrath\
      \ at His inheritance.\n"
    63: "⁶³ Fire devoured His young men,\nAnd His virgins had no wedding songs.\n"
    64: "⁶⁴ His priests fell by the sword,\nAnd His widows could not weep. \n"
    65: "⁶⁵ Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep,\nLike a warrior overcome by wine.\n"
    66: "⁶⁶ He drove His adversaries backward;\nHe put on them an everlasting disgrace.\n"
    67: "⁶⁷ He also rejected the tent of Joseph,\nAnd did not choose the tribe of\
      \ Ephraim,\n"
    68: "⁶⁸ But chose the tribe of Judah,\nMount Zion, which He loved.\n"
    69: "⁶⁹ And He built His sanctuary like the heights,\nLike the earth which He\
      \ has established forever.\n"
    70: "⁷⁰ He also chose His servant David\nAnd took him from the sheepfolds;\n"
    71: "⁷¹ From the care of the ewes with nursing lambs He brought him\nTo shepherd\
      \ Jacob His people,\nAnd Israel His inheritance.\n"
