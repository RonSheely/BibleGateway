      \ have not taken care of my own vineyard.\n"
    7: "⁷ Tell me, you whom my soul loves,\nWhere do you pasture your flock,\nWhere\

      Jumping on the hills!\n"
    9: "⁹ My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.\nBehold, he is standing behind\
      \ our wall,\nHe is looking through the windows,\nHe is peering through the lattice.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “My beloved responded and said to me,\n‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful\
      \ one,\nAnd come along.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For behold, the winter is past,\nThe rain is over and gone.\n"
    12: "¹² The blossoms have already appeared in the land;\nThe time has arrived\
      \ for pruning the vines,\nAnd the voice of the turtledove has been heard in\
      \ our land.\n"

      \ forth their fragrance.\nArise, my darling, my beautiful one,\nAnd come along!’”\

    9: "⁹ You have enchanted my heart, my sister, my bride;\nYou have enchanted my\
      \ heart with a single glance of your eyes,\nWith a single strand of your necklace.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!\nHow much sweeter is\

      \ of fire,\nThe flame of the Lord.\n"
    7: "⁷ Many waters cannot quench love,\nNor will rivers flood over it;\nIf a man\
      \ were to give all the riches of his house for love,\nIt would be utterly despised.”\
      \ \n"

      \ you, Solomon,\nAnd two hundred are for those who take care of its fruit.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ “You who sit in the gardens:\nMy companions are listening for your voice—\n\
      Let me hear it!” \n"
