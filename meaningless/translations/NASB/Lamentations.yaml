Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "¹ How lonely sits the city\nThat once had many people!\nShe has become like\
      \ a widow\nWho was once great among the nations!\nShe who was a princess among\
      \ the provinces\nHas become a forced laborer!\n"
    2: "² She weeps bitterly in the night,\nAnd her tears are on her cheeks;\nShe\
      \ has no one to comfort her\nAmong all her lovers.\nAll her friends have dealt\
      \ treacherously with her;\nThey have become her enemies.\n"
    3: "³ Judah has gone into exile out of affliction\nAnd harsh servitude;\nShe lives\
      \ among the nations,\nBut she has not found a resting place;\nAll those who\
      \ pursued her have overtaken her\nIn the midst of distress.\n"
    4: "⁴ The roads of Zion are in mourning\nBecause no one comes to an appointed\
      \ feast.\nAll her gates are deserted;\nHer priests groan,\nHer virgins are worried,\n\
      And as for Zion herself, it is bitter for her.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her adversaries have become her masters,\nHer enemies are secure;\nFor the\
      \ Lord has caused her grief\nBecause of the multitude of her wrongdoings;\n\
      Her little ones have gone away\nAs captives led by the enemy.\n"
    6: "⁶ All of her splendor\nIs gone from the daughter of Zion;\nHer leaders have\
      \ become like deer\nThat have found no pasture,\nAnd they have fled without\
      \ strength\nFrom the pursuer.\n"
    7: "⁷ In the days of her affliction and homelessness\nJerusalem remembers all\
      \ her treasures\nThat were hers since the days of old,\nWhen her people fell\
      \ into the hand of the adversary\nAnd no one helped her.\nThe adversaries saw\
      \ her,\nThey laughed at her ruin.\n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem sinned greatly,\nTherefore she has become an object of ridicule.\n\
      All who honored her despise her\nBecause they have seen her nakedness;\nEven\
      \ she herself groans and turns away.\n"
    9: "⁹ Her uncleanness was in her garment’s seams;\nShe did not think of her future.\n\
      So she has fallen in an astonishing way;\nShe has no comforter.\n“See, Lord,\
      \ my affliction,\nFor the enemy has honored himself!”\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The adversary has stretched out his hand\nOver all her precious things,\n\
      For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary,\nThe ones whom You commanded\n\
      That they were not to enter Your congregation.\n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people groan, seeking bread;\nThey have given their treasures\
      \ for food\nTo restore their lives.\n“See, Lord, and look,\nFor I am despised.”\n"
    12: "¹² “Is it nothing to all you who pass this way?\nLook and see if there is\
      \ any pain like my pain\nWhich was inflicted on me,\nWith which the Lord tormented\
      \ me on the day of His fierce anger.\n"
    13: "¹³ From the height He sent fire into my bones,\nAnd it dominated them.\n\
      He has spread a net for my feet;\nHe has turned me back;\nHe has made me desolate,\n\
      Faint all day long.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The yoke of my wrongdoings is bound;\nBy His hand they are woven together.\n\
      They have come upon my neck;\nHe has made my strength fail.\nThe Lord has handed\
      \ me over\nTo those against whom I am not able to stand.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has thrown away all my strong men\nIn my midst;\nHe has called\
      \ an appointed time against me\nTo crush my young men;\nThe Lord has trodden\
      \ as in a wine press\nThe virgin daughter of Judah.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For these things I weep;\nMy eyes run down with water;\nBecause far from\
      \ me is a comforter,\nOne to restore my soul.\nMy children are desolate\nBecause\
      \ the enemy has prevailed.”\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion stretches out with her hands;\nThere is no one to comfort her;\n\
      The Lord has commanded regarding Jacob\nThat those around him become his adversaries;\n\
      Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The Lord is righteous,\nFor I have rebelled against His command;\nHear\
      \ now, all peoples,\nAnd see my pain;\nMy virgins and my young men\nHave gone\
      \ into captivity.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I called to my lovers, but they deserted me;\nMy priests and my elders\
      \ perished in the city\nWhile they sought food to restore their strength themselves.\n"
    20: "²⁰ See, Lord, for I am in distress;\nMy spirit is greatly troubled;\nMy heart\
      \ is overturned within me,\nFor I have been very rebellious.\nIn the street\
      \ the sword has made women childless;\nIn the house it is like death.\n"
    21: "²¹ They have heard that I groan;\nThere is no one to comfort me,\nAll my\
      \ enemies have heard of my disaster;\nThey are joyful that You have done it.\n\
      Oh, that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed,\nSo that they will\
      \ become like me.\n"
    22: "²² May all their wickedness come before You;\nAnd deal with them just as\
      \ You have dealt with me\nFor all my wrongdoings.\nFor my groans are many and\
      \ my heart is faint.”"
  2:
    1: "¹ How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion\nWith a cloud in His anger!\n\
      He has hurled\nThe glory of Israel from heaven to earth,\nAnd has not remembered\
      \ His footstool\nIn the day of His anger.\n"
    2: "² The Lord has destroyed; He has not spared\nAll the settlements of Jacob.\n\
      In His wrath He has overthrown\nThe strongholds of the daughter of Judah,\n\
      He has hurled them down to the ground;\nHe has profaned the kingdom and its\
      \ leaders.\n"
    3: "³ In fierce anger He has cut off\nAll the strength of Israel;\nHe has pulled\
      \ back His right hand\nFrom the enemy.\nAnd He has burned in Jacob like a flaming\
      \ fire\nConsuming on all sides.\n"
    4: "⁴ He has bent His bow like an enemy;\nHis right hand is positioned like an\
      \ adversary,\nAnd He has killed everything that was pleasant to the eye.\nIn\
      \ the tent of the daughter of Zion\nHe has poured out His wrath like fire.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord has become like an enemy.\nHe has engulfed Israel;\nHe has engulfed\
      \ all its palaces,\nHe has destroyed its strongholds\nAnd caused great mourning\
      \ and grieving in the daughter of Judah.\n"
    6: "⁶ And He has treated His tabernacle violently, like a despised garden;\nHe\
      \ has destroyed His appointed meeting place.\nThe Lord has caused\nThe appointed\
      \ feast and Sabbath in Zion to be forgotten,\nAnd He has despised king and priest\n\
      In the indignation of His anger.\n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has rejected His altar,\nHe has repudiated His sanctuary;\nHe has\
      \ handed over\nThe walls of her palaces to the enemy.\nThey have made a noise\
      \ in the house of the Lord\nAs on the day of an appointed feast.\n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord determined to destroy\nThe wall of the daughter of Zion.\nHe has\
      \ stretched out a line,\nHe has not restrained His hand from destroying,\nAnd\
      \ He has caused rampart and wall to mourn;\nThey have languished together.\n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground,\nHe has destroyed and broken her bars.\n\
      Her king and her leaders are among the nations;\nThe Law is gone.\nHer prophets,\
      \ too, find\nNo vision from the Lord.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of the daughter of Zion\nSit on the ground and are silent.\n\
      They have thrown dust on their heads;\nThey have put on sackcloth.\nThe virgins\
      \ of Jerusalem\nHave bowed their heads to the ground.\n"
    11: "¹¹ My eyes fail because of tears,\nMy spirit is greatly troubled;\nMy heart\
      \ is poured out on the earth\nBecause of the destruction of the daughter of\
      \ my people,\nWhen little ones and infants languish\nIn the streets of the city.\n"
    12: "¹² They say to their mothers,\n“Where is grain and wine?”\nAs they faint\
      \ like a wounded person\nIn the streets of the city,\nAs their lives are poured\
      \ out\nIn their mothers’ arms.\n"
    13: "¹³ How shall I admonish you?\nWhat shall I compare to you,\nDaughter of Jerusalem?\n\
      What shall I liken to you as I comfort you,\nVirgin daughter of Zion?\nFor your\
      \ collapse is as vast as the sea;\nWho can heal you?\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your prophets have seen for you\nWorthless and deceptive visions;\nAnd\
      \ they have not exposed your wrongdoing\nSo as to restore you from captivity,\n\
      But they have seen for you worthless and misleading pronouncements.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who pass along the way\nClap their hands in ridicule at you;\nThey\
      \ hiss and shake their heads\nAt the daughter of Jerusalem:\n“Is this the city\
      \ of which they said,\n‘Perfect in beauty,\nA joy to all the earth’?”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ All your enemies\nHave opened their mouths wide against you;\nThey hiss\
      \ and gnash their teeth.\nThey say, “We have engulfed her!\nThis certainly is\
      \ the day which we awaited;\nWe have reached it, we have seen it!”\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord has done what He determined;\nHe has accomplished His word\n\
      Which He commanded from days of old.\nHe has torn down without sparing,\nAnd\
      \ He has helped the enemy to rejoice over you;\nHe has exalted the might of\
      \ your adversaries.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Their heart cried out to the Lord:\n“You wall of the daughter of Zion,\n\
      Let your tears stream down like a river day and night;\nGive yourself no relief,\n\
      Let your eyes have no rest.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Arise, whimper in the night\nAt the beginning of the night watches;\n\
      Pour out your heart like water\nBefore the presence of the Lord;\nRaise your\
      \ hands to Him\nFor the life of your little ones\nWho languish because of hunger\n\
      At the head of every street.\n"
    20: "²⁰ See, Lord, and look!\nWith whom have You dealt this way?\nShould women\
      \ really eat their children,\nThe little ones who were born healthy?\nShould\
      \ priest and prophet really be killed\nIn the sanctuary of the Lord?\n"
    21: "²¹ On the ground in the streets\nLie young and old;\nMy virgins and my young\
      \ men\nHave fallen by the sword.\nYou have put them to death on the day of Your\
      \ anger,\nYou have slaughtered, without sparing.\n"
    22: "²² You called as on the day of an appointed feast\nMy terrors on every side;\n\
      And there was no one who survived or escaped\nOn the day of the Lord’s anger.\n\
      As for those whom I brought forth healthy and whom I raised,\nMy enemy annihilated\
      \ them.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ I am the man who has seen misery\nBecause of the rod of His wrath.\n"
    2: "² He has driven me and made me walk\nIn darkness and not in light.\n"
    3: "³ Indeed, He has turned His hand against me\nRepeatedly all the day.\n"
    4: "⁴ He has consumed my flesh and my skin,\nHe has broken my bones.\n"
    5: "⁵ He has besieged and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.\n"
    6: "⁶ He has made me live in dark places,\nLike those who have long been dead.\n"
    7: "⁷ He has walled me in so that I cannot go out;\nHe has made my chain heavy.\n"
    8: "⁸ Even when I cry out and call for help,\nHe shuts out my prayer.\n"
    9: "⁹ He has blocked my ways with cut stone;\nHe has twisted my paths.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ He is to me like a bear lying in wait,\nLike a lion in secret places.\n"
    11: "¹¹ He has made my ways deviate, and torn me to pieces;\nHe has made me desolate.\n"
    12: "¹² He bent His bow\nAnd took aim at me as a target for the arrow.\n"
    13: "¹³ He made the arrows of His quiver\nEnter my inward parts.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I have become a laughingstock to all my people,\nTheir song of ridicule\
      \ all the day.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He has filled me with bitterness,\nHe has made me drink plenty of wormwood.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He has also made my teeth grind with gravel;\nHe has made me cower in\
      \ the dust.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ My soul has been excluded from peace;\nI have forgotten happiness.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ So I say, “My strength has failed,\nAnd so has my hope from the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Remember my misery and my homelessness, the wormwood and bitterness.\n"
    20: "²⁰ My soul certainly remembers,\nAnd is bent over within me.\n"
    21: "²¹ I recall this to my mind,\nTherefore I wait.\n"
    22: "²² The Lord’s acts of mercy indeed do not end,\nFor His compassions do not\
      \ fail.\n"
    23: "²³ They are new every morning;\nGreat is Your faithfulness.\n"
    24: "²⁴ “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,\n“Therefore I wait for Him.”\n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord is good to those who await Him,\nTo the person who seeks Him.\n"
    26: "²⁶ It is good that he waits silently\nFor the salvation of the Lord.\n"
    27: "²⁷ It is good for a man to bear\nThe yoke in his youth.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Let him sit alone and keep quiet,\nSince He has laid it on him.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Let him put his mouth in the dust;\nPerhaps there is hope.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Let him give his cheek to the one who is going to strike him;\nLet him\
      \ be filled with shame.\n"
    31: "³¹ For the Lord will not reject forever,\n"
    32: "³² For if He causes grief,\nThen He will have compassion\nIn proportion to\
      \ His abundant mercy.\n"
    33: "³³ For He does not afflict willingly\nOr grieve the sons of mankind.\n"
    34: "³⁴ To crush under one’s feet\nAll the prisoners of the land,\n"
    35: "³⁵ To deprive a man of justice\nIn the presence of the Most High,\n"
    36: "³⁶ To defraud someone in his lawsuit—\nOf these things the Lord does not\
      \ approve.\n"
    37: "³⁷ Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass,\nUnless the Lord has commanded\
      \ it?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Is it not from the mouth of the Most High\nThat both adversity and good\
      \ proceed? \n"
    39: "³⁹ Of what can any living mortal, or any man,\nComplain in view of his sins?\n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Let’s examine and search out our ways,\nAnd let’s return to the Lord.\n"
    41: "⁴¹ We raise our heart and hands\nToward God in heaven;\n"
    42: "⁴² We have done wrong and rebelled;\nYou have not pardoned.\n"
    43: "⁴³ You have covered Yourself with anger\nAnd pursued us;\nYou have slain\
      \ and have not spared.\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ You have veiled Yourself with a cloud\nSo that no prayer can pass through.\n"
    45: "⁴⁵ You have made us mere refuse and rubbish\nIn the midst of the peoples.\n"
    46: "⁴⁶ All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ Panic and pitfall have come upon us,\nDevastation and destruction;\n"

      \ the daughter of my people.\n"
    49: "⁴⁹ My eyes flow unceasingly,\nWithout stopping,\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Until the Lord looks down\nAnd sees from heaven.\n"
    51: "⁵¹ My eyes bring pain to my soul\nBecause of all the daughters of my city.\n"
    52: "⁵² My enemies without reason\nHunted me down like a bird;\n"
    53: "⁵³ They have silenced me in the pit\nAnd have thrown stones on me.\n"
    54: "⁵⁴ Waters flowed over my head;\nI said, “I am cut off!”\n"

    56: "⁵⁶ You have heard my voice,\n“Do not cover Your ear from my plea for relief,\n\
      From my cry for help.”\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ You came near on the day I called to You;\nYou said, “Do not fear!”\n"
    58: "⁵⁸ Lord, You have pleaded my soul’s cause;\nYou have redeemed my life.\n"

    62: "⁶² The lips of my assailants and their talk\nAre against me all day long.\n"
    63: "⁶³ Look at their sitting and their rising;\nI am their mocking song.\n"
    64: "⁶⁴ You will repay them, Lord,\nIn accordance with the work of their hands.\n"
    65: "⁶⁵ You will give them shamelessness of heart,\nYour curse will be on them.\n"
    66: "⁶⁶ You will pursue them in anger and eliminate them\nFrom under the heavens\
      \ of the Lord!"
  4:
    1: "¹ How dark the gold has become,\nHow the pure gold has changed!\nThe sacred\
      \ stones are spilled out\nAt the corner of every street.\n"
    2: "² The precious sons of Zion,\nWeighed against pure gold,\nHow they are regarded\
      \ as earthenware jars,\nThe work of a potter’s hands!\n"
    3: "³ Even jackals offer the breast,\nThey nurse their young;\nBut the daughter\
      \ of my people has proved herself cruel,\nLike ostriches in the wilderness.\n"
    4: "⁴ The tongue of the infant clings\nTo the roof of its mouth because of thirst;\n\
      The children ask for bread,\nBut no one breaks it for them.\n"
    5: "⁵ Those who used to eat delicacies\nAre made to tremble in the streets;\n\
      Those who were raised in crimson clothing\nEmbrace garbage heaps.\n"
    6: "⁶ For the wrongdoing of the daughter of my people\nIs greater than the sin\
      \ of Sodom,\nWhich was overthrown as in a moment,\nAnd no hands were turned\
      \ toward her.\n"
    7: "⁷ Her consecrated ones were purer than snow,\nThey shined more than milk;\n\
      They were more ruddy in body than pearls of coral,\nTheir form was like lapis\
      \ lazuli.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their appearance is darker than soot,\nThey are not recognized in the streets;\n\
      Their skin is shriveled on their bones,\nIt is dry, it has become like wood.\n"
    9: "⁹ Better off are those killed by the sword\nThan those killed by hunger;\n\
      For they waste away, stricken\nBy the lack of the produce of the field.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The hands of compassionate women\nBoiled their own children;\nThey became\
      \ food for them\nDue to the destruction of the daughter of my people.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord has expended His wrath,\nHe has poured out His fierce anger;\n\
      And He has kindled a fire in Zion,\nAnd it has consumed its foundations.\n"
    12: "¹² The kings of the earth did not believe,\nNor did any of the inhabitants\
      \ of the world,\nThat the adversary and the enemy\nWould enter the gates of\
      \ Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ Because of the sins of her prophets\nAnd the wrongdoings of her priests,\n\
      Who have shed in her midst\nThe blood of the righteous,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They wandered, blind, in the streets;\nThey were defiled with blood,\n\
      Such that no one could touch their garments.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Keep away! Unclean!” they cried out of themselves.\n“Keep away, keep\
      \ away, do not touch!”\nFor they distanced themselves as well as wandered;\n\
      People among the nations said,\n“They shall not continue to reside with us.”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The presence of the Lord has scattered them,\nHe will not continue to\
      \ look at them;\nThey did not honor the priests,\nThey did not favor the elders.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Yet our eyes failed,\nLooking for help was useless;\nAt our observation\
      \ point we have watched\nFor a nation that could not save.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ They hunted our steps\nSo that we could not walk in our streets;\nOur\
      \ end drew near,\nOur days were finished\nFor our end had come.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Our pursuers were swifter\nThan the eagles of the sky;\nThey chased us\
      \ on the mountains,\nThey waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The breath of our nostrils, the Lord’s anointed,\nWas captured in their\
      \ pits,\nOf whom we had said, “In his shadow\nWe shall live among the nations.”\n"
    21: "²¹ Rejoice and be joyful, daughter of Edom,\nWho lives in the land of Uz;\n\
      But the cup will pass to you as well,\nYou will become drunk and expose yourself.\n"
    22: "²² The punishment of your wrongdoing has been completed, daughter of Zion;\n\
      He will no longer exile you.\nBut He will punish your wrongdoing, daughter of\
      \ Edom;\nHe will expose your sins!"

      \ of wood.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Elders are absent from the gate,\nYoung men from their music.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The joy of our hearts has ended;\nOur dancing has been turned into mourning.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The crown has fallen from our head;\nWoe to us, for we have sinned!\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Because of this our heart is faint,\nBecause of these things our eyes\
      \ are dim;\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate,\nJackals prowl in it. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ You, Lord, rule forever;\nYour throne is from generation to generation.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Why will You forget us forever?\nWhy do You abandon us for so long?\n"
    21: "²¹ Restore us to You, Lord, so that we may be restored;\nRenew our days as\
      \ of old,\n"
    22: "²² Unless You have utterly rejected us\nAnd are exceedingly angry with us."
