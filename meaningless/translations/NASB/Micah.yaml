Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham,\
      \ Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and which he saw regarding Samaria and\
      \ Jerusalem. \n"
    2: "² Hear, you peoples, all of you;\nListen carefully, earth and all it contains,\n\
      And may the Lord God be a witness against you,\nThe Lord from His holy temple.\n"
    3: "³ For behold, the Lord is coming forth from His place.\nHe will come down\
      \ and tread on the high places of the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ The mountains will melt under Him\nAnd the valleys will be split,\nLike\
      \ wax before the fire,\nLike water poured down a steep place.\n"
    5: "⁵ All this is due to the wrongdoing of Jacob\nAnd the sins of the house of\
      \ Israel.\nWhat is the wrongdoing of Jacob?\nIs it not Samaria?\nWhat is the\
      \ high place of Judah?\nIs it not Jerusalem?\n"
    6: "⁶ For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country,\nPlanting places\
      \ for a vineyard.\nI will hurl her stones down into the valley,\nAnd lay bare\
      \ her foundations.\n"
    7: "⁷ All of her idols will be crushed,\nAll of her earnings will be burned with\
      \ fire,\nAnd all of her images I will make desolate;\nFor she collected them\
      \ from a prostitute’s earnings,\nAnd to the earnings of a prostitute they will\
      \ return. \n"
    8: "⁸ Because of this I must mourn and wail,\nI must go barefoot and naked;\n\
      I must do mourning like the jackals,\nAnd a mourning like the ostriches.\n"
    9: "⁹ For her wound is incurable,\nFor it has come to Judah;\nIt has reached the\
      \ gate of my people,\nEven to Jerusalem.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not tell it in Gath,\nDo not weep at all.\nAt Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself\
      \ in the dust in mourning.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness.\nThe inhabitant\
      \ of Zaanan does not escape.\nThe mourning of Beth-ezel: “He will take from\
      \ you its support.”\n"
    12: "¹² For the inhabitant of Maroth\nWaits for something good,\nBecause a disaster\
      \ has come down from the Lord\nTo the gate of Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ Harness the chariot to the team of horses,\nYou inhabitant of Lachish—\n\
      She was the beginning of sin\nTo the daughter of Zion—\nBecause in you were\
      \ found\nThe rebellious acts of Israel.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore you will give parting gifts\nIn behalf of Moresheth-gath;\n\
      The houses of Achzib will become a deception\nTo the kings of Israel.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Moreover, I will bring on you\nThe one who takes possession,\nYou inhabitant\
      \ of Mareshah.\nThe glory of Israel will enter Adullam.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Shave yourself bald, yes, cut off your hair,\nBecause of the children\
      \ of your delight;\nExtend your baldness like the eagle,\nFor they will go from\
      \ you into exile."
  2:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who devise wrongdoing,\nWho practice evil on their beds!\n\
      When morning comes, they do it,\nBecause it is in the power of their hands.\n"
    2: "² They covet fields, so they seize them;\nAnd houses, so they take them.\n\
      They exploit a man and his house,\nA person and his inheritance. \n"
    3: "³ Therefore this is what the Lord says:\n“Behold, I am planning against this\
      \ family a catastrophe\nFrom which you cannot remove your necks;\nAnd you will\
      \ not walk haughtily,\nFor it will be an evil time.\n"
    4: "⁴ On that day they will take up against you a song of mocking\nAnd utter a\
      \ song of mourning and say,\n‘We are completely destroyed!\nHe exchanges the\
      \ share of my people;\nHow He removes it from me!\nTo the apostate He apportions\
      \ our fields.’\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you will have no one applying a measuring line\nFor you by lot\
      \ in the assembly of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ ‘Do not prophesy,’ so they prophesy.\nBut if they do not prophesy about\
      \ these things,\nInsults will not be turned back.\n"
    7: "⁷ Is it being said, house of Jacob:\n‘Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient?\n\
      Are these His works?’\nDo My words not do good\nFor the one walking rightly?\n"
    8: "⁸ Recently My people have arisen as an enemy—\nYou strip the robe off the\
      \ garment\nFrom unsuspecting passers-by,\nFrom those returned from war.\n"
    9: "⁹ You evict the women of My people,\nEach one from her pleasant house.\nFrom\
      \ her children you take My splendor forever.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Arise and go,\nFor this is no place of rest\nBecause of the uncleanness\
      \ that brings on destruction,\nA painful destruction.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If someone walking after wind and falsehood\nHad lied and said,\n‘I will\
      \ prophesy to you about wine and liquor,’\nHe would become a prophet to this\
      \ people. \n"
    12: "¹² “I will certainly assemble all of you, Jacob,\nI will certainly gather\
      \ the remnant of Israel.\nI will put them together like sheep in the fold;\n\
      Like a flock in the midst of its pasture\nThey will be noisy with people.\n"
    13: "¹³ The one who breaks through goes up before them;\nThey break through, pass\
      \ through the gate, and go out by it.\nSo their king passes on before them,\n\
      And the Lord at their head.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ And I said,\n“Hear now, you leaders of Jacob\nAnd rulers of the house of\
      \ Israel:\nIs it not for you to know justice?\n"
    2: "² You who hate good and love evil,\nWho tear off their skin from them\nAnd\
      \ their flesh from their bones,\n"
    3: "³ Who eat the flesh of my people,\nStrip off their skin from them,\nSmash\
      \ their bones,\nAnd chop them up as for the pot,\nAnd as meat in a cauldron!”\n"
    4: "⁴ Then they will cry out to the Lord,\nBut He will not answer them.\nInstead,\
      \ He will hide His face from them at that time\nBecause they have practiced\
      \ evil deeds. \n"
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray:\n\
      When they have something to bite with their teeth,\nThey cry out, “Peace!”\n\
      But against him who puts nothing in their mouths\nThey declare holy war.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore it will be night for you—without vision,\nAnd darkness for you—without\
      \ divination.\nThe sun will go down on the prophets,\nAnd the day will become\
      \ dark over them.\n"
    7: "⁷ The seers will be put to shame,\nAnd the diviners will be ashamed.\nIndeed,\
      \ they will all cover their lips\nBecause there is no answer from God.\n"
    8: "⁸ On the other hand, I am filled with power—\nWith the Spirit of the Lord—\n\
      And with justice and courage\nTo make known to Jacob his rebellious act,\nAnd\
      \ to Israel his sin.\n"
    9: "⁹ Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob\nAnd rulers of the house\
      \ of Israel,\nWho despise justice\nAnd twist everything that is straight,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Who build Zion with bloodshed,\nAnd Jerusalem with malice.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe,\nHer priests teach for pay,\n\
      And her prophets divine for money.\nYet they lean on the Lord, saying,\n“Is\
      \ the Lord not in our midst?\nCatastrophe will not come upon us.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore on account of you,\nZion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem\
      \ will become a heap of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the temple will become high\
      \ places of a forest."
  4:
    1: "¹ And it will come about in the last days\nThat the mountain of the house\
      \ of the Lord\nWill be established as the chief of the mountains.\nIt will be\
      \ raised above the hills,\nAnd the peoples will stream to it.\n"
    2: "² Many nations will come and say,\n“Come and let’s go up to the mountain of\
      \ the Lord\nAnd to the house of the God of Jacob,\nSo that He may teach us about\
      \ His ways,\nAnd that we may walk in His paths.”\nFor from Zion will go forth\
      \ the law,\nAnd the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    3: "³ And He will judge between many peoples\nAnd render decisions for mighty,\
      \ distant nations.\nThen they will beat their swords into plowshares,\nAnd their\
      \ spears into pruning hooks;\nNation will not lift a sword against nation,\n\
      And never again will they train for war.\n"
    4: "⁴ Instead, each of them will sit under his vine\nAnd under his fig tree,\n\
      With no one to make them afraid,\nBecause the mouth of the Lord of armies has\
      \ spoken.\n"
    5: "⁵ Though all the peoples walk,\nEach in the name of his god,\nAs for us, we\
      \ will walk\nIn the name of the Lord our God forever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ “On that day,” declares the Lord,\n“I will assemble those who limp\nAnd\
      \ gather the scattered,\nThose whom I have afflicted.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will make those who limp a remnant,\nAnd those who have strayed a mighty\
      \ nation,\nAnd the Lord will reign over them on Mount Zion\nFrom now on and\
      \ forever.\n"
    8: "⁸ As for you, tower of the flock,\nHill of the daughter of Zion,\nTo you it\
      \ will come—\nYes, the former dominion will come,\nThe kingdom of the daughter\
      \ of Jerusalem. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Now, why do you cry out loudly?\nIs there no king among you,\nOr has your\
      \ counselor perished,\nThat agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Writhe and scream,\nDaughter of Zion,\nLike a woman in childbirth;\nFor\
      \ now you will go out of the city,\nLive in the field,\nAnd go to Babylon.\n\
      There you will be rescued,\nThere the Lord will redeem you\nFrom the hand of\
      \ your enemies.\n"
    11: "¹¹ And now many nations have been assembled against you\nWho say, ‘Let her\
      \ be defiled,\nAnd let our eyes gloat over Zion!’\n"
    12: "¹² But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord,\nAnd they do not understand\
      \ His plan;\nFor He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.\n"
    13: "¹³ Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,\nFor I will make your horn iron,\n\
      And I will make your hoofs bronze,\nSo that you may pulverize many peoples,\n\
      And dedicate to the Lord their unjust profit,\nAnd their wealth to the Lord\
      \ of all the earth."
  5:
    1: "¹ “Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops;\nThey have laid siege\
      \ against us;\nWith a rod they will strike the judge of Israel on the cheek.\n"
    2: "² But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,\nToo little to be among the clans of\
      \ Judah,\nFrom you One will come forth for Me to be ruler in Israel.\nHis times\
      \ of coming forth are from long ago,\nFrom the days of eternity.”\n"
    3: "³ Therefore He will give them up until the time\nWhen she who is in labor\
      \ has given birth.\nThen the remainder of His kinsmen\nWill return to the sons\
      \ of Israel.\n"
    4: "⁴ And He will arise and shepherd His flock\nIn the strength of the Lord,\n\
      In the majesty of the name of the Lord His God.\nAnd they will remain,\nBecause\
      \ at that time He will be great\nTo the ends of the earth.\n"
    5: "⁵ This One will be our peace.\nWhen the Assyrian invades our land,\nWhen he\
      \ tramples on our citadels,\nThen we will raise against him\nSeven shepherds\
      \ and eight leaders of people.\n"
    6: "⁶ They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,\nThe land of Nimrod\
      \ at its entrances;\nAnd He will rescue us from the Assyrian\nWhen he invades\
      \ our land,\nAnd when he tramples our territory. \n"
    7: "⁷ Then the remnant of Jacob\nWill be among many peoples\nLike dew from the\
      \ Lord,\nLike showers on vegetation\nThat do not wait for man,\nOr delay for\
      \ mankind.\n"
    8: "⁸ The remnant of Jacob\nWill be among the nations,\nAmong many peoples\nLike\
      \ a lion among the animals of the forest,\nLike a young lion among flocks of\
      \ sheep,\nWhich, if he passes through,\nTramples and tears,\nAnd there is no\
      \ one who can rescue.\n"
    9: "⁹ Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries,\nAnd all your enemies\
      \ will be eliminated. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “And it will be on that day,” declares the Lord,\n“That I will eliminate\
      \ your horses from among you,\nAnd destroy your chariots.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will also eliminate the cities of your land,\nAnd tear down all your\
      \ fortifications.\n"
    12: "¹² I will eliminate sorceries from your hand,\nAnd you will have no fortune-tellers.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will eliminate your carved images\nAnd your memorial stones from among\
      \ you,\nSo that you will no longer bow down\nTo the work of your hands.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will uproot your Asherim from among you,\nAnd destroy your cities.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath\nOn the nations which\
      \ have not obeyed.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Hear now what the Lord is saying,\n“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,\n\
      And let the hills hear your voice.\n"
    2: "² Listen, you mountains, to the indictment by the Lord,\nAnd you enduring\
      \ foundations of the earth,\nBecause the Lord has a case against His people;\n\
      And He will dispute with Israel.\n"
    3: "³ My people, what have I done to you,\nAnd how have I wearied you? Answer\
      \ Me.\n"
    4: "⁴ Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt,\nI redeemed you from the\
      \ house of slavery,\nAnd I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.\n"
    5: "⁵ My people, remember now\nWhat Balak king of Moab planned\nAnd what Balaam\
      \ son of Beor answered him,\nAnd what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,\nSo that\
      \ you might know the righteous acts of the Lord.” \n"
    6: "⁶ With what shall I come to the Lord\nAnd bow myself before the God on high?\n\
      Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings,\nWith yearling calves?\n"
    7: "⁷ Does the Lord take pleasure in thousands of rams,\nIn ten thousand rivers\
      \ of oil?\nShall I give Him my firstborn for my wrongdoings,\nThe fruit of my\
      \ body for the sin of my soul?\n"
    8: "⁸ He has told you, mortal one, what is good;\nAnd what does the Lord require\
      \ of you\nBut to do justice, to love kindness,\nAnd to walk humbly with your\
      \ God? \n"
    9: "⁹ The voice of the Lord will call to the city—\nAnd it is sound wisdom to\
      \ fear Your name:\n“Hear, you tribe. Who has designated its time?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Is there still a person in the wicked house,\nAlong with treasures of\
      \ wickedness,\nAnd a short measure that is cursed?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Can I justify dishonest balances,\nAnd a bag of fraudulent weights?\n"
    12: "¹² For the rich people of the city are full of violence,\nHer residents speak\
      \ lies,\nAnd their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.\n"
    13: "¹³ So also I will make you sick, striking you down,\nMaking you desolate\
      \ because of your sins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You will eat, but you will not be satisfied,\nAnd your filth will be in\
      \ your midst.\nYou will try to remove valuables for safekeeping,\nBut you will\
      \ not save it all,\nAnd what you do save I will turn over to the sword.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You will sow but you will not harvest.\nYou will tread the olive press\
      \ but will not anoint yourself with oil;\nAnd tread out sweet wine, but you\
      \ will not drink any wine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The statutes of Omri\nAnd every work of the house of Ahab are maintained,\n\
      And you walk by their plans.\nTherefore I will give you up for destruction,\n\
      And your inhabitants for derision,\nAnd you will suffer the taunting of My people.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ Woe to me! For I am\nLike harvests of summer fruit, like gleanings of grapes.\n\
      There is not a cluster of grapes left to eat,\nNor an early fig, which I crave.\n"
    2: "² The godly person has perished from the land,\nAnd there is no upright person\
      \ among mankind.\nAll of them lie in wait for bloodshed;\nEach of them hunts\
      \ the other with a net.\n"
    3: "³ As for evil, both hands do it well.\nThe leader asks for a bribe, also the\
      \ judge,\nAnd the great one speaks the capricious desire of his soul;\nSo they\
      \ plot it together.\n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is like a thorn bush,\nThe most upright like a thorn hedge.\n\
      The day when you post your watchmen,\nYour punishment is coming.\nThen their\
      \ confusion will occur.\n"
    5: "⁵ Do not trust in a neighbor;\nDo not have confidence in a close friend.\n\
      Guard your lips\nFrom her who lies in your arms.\n"
    6: "⁶ For son disavows father,\nDaughter rises up against her mother,\nDaughter-in-law\
      \ against her mother-in-law;\nA person’s enemies are the people of his own household.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ But as for me, I will be on the watch for the Lord;\nI will wait for the\
      \ God of my salvation.\nMy God will hear me.\n"
    8: "⁸ Do not rejoice over me, enemy of mine.\nThough I fall I will rise;\nThough\
      \ I live in darkness, the Lord is a light for me. \n"
    9: "⁹ I will endure the rage of the Lord\nBecause I have sinned against Him,\n\
      Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me.\nHe will bring me out to\
      \ the light,\nAnd I will look at His righteousness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then my enemy will see,\nAnd shame will cover her who said to me,\n“Where\
      \ is the Lord your God?”\nMy eyes will look at her;\nAt that time she will be\
      \ trampled down\nLike mud of the streets.\n"
    11: "¹¹ It will be a day for building your walls.\nOn that day your boundary will\
      \ be extended.\n"
    12: "¹² It will be a day when they will come to you\nFrom Assyria and the cities\
      \ of Egypt,\nFrom Egypt even to the Euphrates River,\nEven from sea to sea and\
      \ mountain to mountain.\n"
    13: "¹³ And the earth will become a wasteland because of her inhabitants,\nOn\
      \ account of the fruit of their deeds. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shepherd Your people with Your scepter,\nThe flock of Your possession\n\
      Which lives by itself in the woodland,\nIn the midst of a fruitful field.\n\
      Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead\nAs in the days of old.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ “As in the days when you went out from the land of Egypt,\nI will show\
      \ you miracles.”\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Nations will see and be ashamed\nOf all their might.\nThey will put their\
      \ hand on their mouth,\nTheir ears will be deaf.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They will lick up dust like a snake,\nLike reptiles of the earth.\nThey\
      \ will come trembling out of their fortresses;\nTo the Lord our God they will\
      \ come in trepidation,\nAnd they will be afraid of You.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like You, who pardons wrongdoing\nAnd passes over a rebellious\
      \ act of the remnant of His possession?\nHe does not retain His anger forever,\n\
      Because He delights in mercy.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will again take pity on us;\nHe will trample on our wrongdoings.\n\
      Yes, You will cast all their sins\nInto the depths of the sea.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You will give truth to Jacob\nAnd favor to Abraham,\nWhich You swore to\
      \ our forefathers\nFrom the days of old."
