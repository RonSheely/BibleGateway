3 John:
  1:
    1: "¹ The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. \n"
    2: '² Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health,
      just as your soul prospers. '
    3: '³ For I was overjoyed when brothers came and testified to your truth, that
      is, how you are walking in truth. '
    4: "⁴ I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brothers
      and sisters, and especially when they are strangers; '
    6: '⁶ and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well
      to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. '
    7: '⁷ For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. '
    8: "⁸ Therefore we ought to support such people, so that we may prove to be fellow\
      \ workers with the truth. \n"
    9: '⁹ I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among
      them, does not accept what we say. '
    10: "¹⁰ For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he\
      \ does, unjustly accusing us with malicious words; and not satisfied with this,\
      \ he himself does not receive the brothers either, and he forbids those who\
      \ want to do so and puts them out of the church. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does
      what is good is of God; the one who does what is evil has not seen God. '
    12: "¹² Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth\
      \ itself; and we testify too, and you know that our testimony is true. \n"
    13: '¹³ I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with
      pen and ink; '
    14: "¹⁴ but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face. \n"
    15: ¹⁵ Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
