2 Timothy:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise\
      \ of life in Christ Jesus, \n"
    2: "² To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father\
      \ and Christ Jesus our Lord. \n"
    3: '³ I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers
      did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day, '
    4: '⁴ longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled
      with joy. '
    5: '⁵ For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelled in
      your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you
      as well. '
    6: '⁶ For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in
      you through the laying on of my hands. '
    7: "⁷ For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and\
      \ discipline. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner,
      but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, '
    9: '⁹ who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works,
      but according to His own purpose and grace, which was granted to us in Christ
      Jesus from all eternity, '
    10: '¹⁰ but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus,
      who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, '
    11: '¹¹ for which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. '
    12: '¹² For this reason I also suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for
      I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to protect what
      I have entrusted to Him until that day. '
    13: '¹³ Hold on to the example of sound words which you have heard from me, in
      the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. '
    14: "¹⁴ Protect, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which\
      \ has been entrusted to you. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me,
      among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. '
    16: '¹⁶ The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed
      me and was not ashamed of my chains; '
    17: '¹⁷ but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me— '
    18: ¹⁸ the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know
      very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
  2:
    1: '¹ You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. '
    2: '² The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses,
      entrust these to faithful people who will be able to teach others also. '
    3: '³ Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. '
    4: '⁴ No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday
      life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him. '
    5: '⁵ And if someone likewise competes as an athlete, he is not crowned as victor
      unless he competes according to the rules. '
    6: '⁶ The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the
      crops. '
    7: "⁷ Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according
      to my gospel, '
    9: '⁹ for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the
      word of God is not imprisoned. '
    10: '¹⁰ For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen,
      so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with
      it eternal glory. '
    11: "¹¹ The statement is trustworthy:\nFor if we died with Him, we will also live\
      \ with Him;\n"
    12: "¹² If we endure, we will also reign with Him;\nIf we deny Him, He will also\
      \ deny us;\n"
    13: "¹³ If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Remind them of these things, and solemnly exhort them in the presence
      of God not to dispute about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of
      the listeners. '
    15: '¹⁵ Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not
      need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. '
    16: '¹⁶ But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness, '
    17: '¹⁷ and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and
      Philetus, '
    18: '¹⁸ men who have gone astray from the truth, claiming that the resurrection
      has already taken place; and they are jeopardizing the faith of some. '
    19: "¹⁹ Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The\
      \ Lord knows those who are His;” and, “Everyone who names the name of the Lord\
      \ is to keep away from wickedness.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver implements, but
      also implements of wood and of earthenware, and some are for honor while others
      are for dishonor. '
    21: '²¹ Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be an
      implement for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good
      work. '
    22: '²² Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and
      peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. '
    23: '²³ But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce
      quarrels. '
    24: '²⁴ The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful
      in teaching, patient when wronged, '
    25: '²⁵ with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God
      may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, '
    26: ²⁶ and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil,
      having been held captive by him to do his will.
  3:
    1: '¹ But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. '
    2: '² For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,
      slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, '
    3: '³ unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal,
      haters of good, '
    4: '⁴ treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers
      of God, '
    5: '⁵ holding to a form of godliness although they have denied its power; avoid
      such people as these. '
    6: '⁶ For among them are those who slip into households and captivate weak women
      weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, '
    7: '⁷ always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. '
    8: '⁸ Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth,
      men of depraved mind, worthless in regard to the faith. '
    9: "⁹ But they will not make further progress; for their foolishness will be obvious\
      \ to all, just as was that also of Jannes and Jambres. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love,
      perseverance, '
    11: '¹¹ persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium,
      and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued
      me! '
    12: '¹² Indeed, all who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. '
    13: '¹³ But evil people and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving
      and being deceived. '
    14: '¹⁴ You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced
      of, knowing from whom you have learned them, '
    15: '¹⁵ and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able
      to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ
      Jesus. '
    16: '¹⁶ All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke,
      for correction, for training in righteousness; '
    17: ¹⁷ so that the man or woman of God may be fully capable, equipped for every
      good work.
  4:
    1: '¹ I solemnly exhort you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is
      to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: '
    2: '² preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke,
      and exhort, with great patience and instruction. '
    3: '³ For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine; but wanting
      to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in
      accordance with their own desires, '
    4: '⁴ and they will turn their ears away from the truth and will turn aside to
      myths. '
    5: "⁵ But as for you, use self-restraint in all things, endure hardship, do the\
      \ work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. \n"
    6: '⁶ For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my
      departure has come. '
    7: '⁷ I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the
      faith; '
    8: "⁸ in the future there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which\
      \ the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only\
      \ to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. \n"
    9: '⁹ Make every effort to come to me soon; '
    10: '¹⁰ for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to
      Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. '
    11: '¹¹ Only Luke is with me. Take along Mark and bring him with you, for he is
      useful to me for service. '
    12: '¹² But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. '
    13: '¹³ When you come, bring the overcoat which I left at Troas with Carpus, and
      the books, especially the parchments. '
    14: '¹⁴ Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according
      to his deeds. '
    15: "¹⁵ Be on guard against him yourself too, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.\
      \ \n"
    16: '¹⁶ At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not
      be counted against them. '
    17: '¹⁷ But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the
      proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear;
      and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth. '
    18: "¹⁸ The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely\
      \ to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. '
    20: '²⁰ Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus. '
    21: "²¹ Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens,\
      \ Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. \n"
    22: ²² The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
