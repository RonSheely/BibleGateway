God, don’t keep silent.
    Don’t keep silent,
    and don’t be still, God.
² For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.
    Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
³ They conspire with cunning against your people.
    They plot against your cherished ones.
⁴ “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation,
    that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”
⁵ For they have conspired together with one mind.
    They form an alliance against you.
⁶ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
    Moab, and the Hagrites;
⁷ Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;
    Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Assyria also is joined with them.
    They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.
⁹ Do to them as you did to Midian,
    as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
¹⁰ who perished at Endor,
    who became as dung for the earth.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
    yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹²     who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasture lands.”
¹³ My God, make them like tumbleweed,
    like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ As the fire that burns the forest,
    as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
¹⁵     so pursue them with your tempest,
    and terrify them with your storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with confusion,
    that they may seek your name, Yahweh.
¹⁷ Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.
    Yes, let them be confounded and perish;
¹⁸ that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh,
    are the Most High over all the earth.
