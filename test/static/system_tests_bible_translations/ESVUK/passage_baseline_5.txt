O God, do not keep silence;
    do not hold your peace or be still, O God!
² For behold, your enemies make an uproar;
    those who hate you have raised their heads.
³ They lay crafty plans against your people;
    they consult together against your treasured ones.
⁴ They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
    let the name of Israel be remembered no more!”
⁵ For they conspire with one accord;
    against you they make a covenant—
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
    Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
    Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Asshur also has joined them;
    they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah
⁹ Do to them as you did to Midian,
    as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,
¹⁰ who were destroyed at En-dor,
    who became dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
    all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let us take possession for ourselves
    of the pastures of God.”
¹³ O my God, make them like whirling dust,
    like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ As fire consumes the forest,
    as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
¹⁵ so may you pursue them with your tempest
    and terrify them with your hurricane!
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame,
    that they may seek your name, O Lord.
¹⁷ Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;
    let them perish in disgrace,
¹⁸ that they may know that you alone,
    whose name is the Lord,
    are the Most High over all the earth.
