¹ O God, do not keep silent;
    do not hold your peace or be still, O God!
² Even now your enemies are in tumult;
    those who hate you have raised their heads.
³ They lay crafty plans against your people;
    they consult together against those you protect.
⁴ They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
    let the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
⁵ They conspire with one accord;
    against you they make a covenant—
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
    Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
    Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Assyria also has joined them;
    they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah 
⁹ Do to them as you did to Midian,
    as to Sisera and Jabin at the Wadi Kishon,
¹⁰ who were destroyed at En-dor,
    who became dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
    all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let us take the pastures of God
    for our own possession.” 
¹³ O my God, make them like whirling dust,
    like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ As fire consumes the forest,
    as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
¹⁵ so pursue them with your tempest
    and terrify them with your hurricane.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame,
    so that they may seek your name, O Lord.
¹⁷ Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever;
    let them perish in disgrace.
¹⁸ Let them know that you alone,
    whose name is the Lord,
    are the Most High over all the earth.
