O God, keep not thou silence:
Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
² For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult;
And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
³ They take crafty counsel against thy people,
And consult together against thy hidden ones.
⁴ They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
⁵ For they have consulted together with one consent;
Against thee do they make a covenant:
⁶ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
Moab, and the Hagarenes;
⁷ Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
⁸ Assyria also is joined with them;
They have helped the children of Lot. Selah
⁹ Do thou unto them as unto Midian,
As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
¹⁰ Who perished at Endor,
Who became as dung for the earth.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
¹² Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession
The habitations of God.
¹³ O my God, make them like the whirling dust;
As stubble before the wind.
¹⁴ As the fire that burneth the forest,
And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,
¹⁵ So pursue them with thy tempest,
And terrify them with thy storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with confusion,
That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.
¹⁷ Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;
Yea, let them be confounded and perish;
¹⁸ That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah,
Art the Most High over all the earth.
