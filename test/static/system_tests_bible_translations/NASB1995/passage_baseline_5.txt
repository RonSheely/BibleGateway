O God, do not remain quiet;
Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.
² For behold, Your enemies make an uproar,
And those who hate You have exalted themselves.
³ They make shrewd plans against Your people,
And conspire together against Your treasured ones.
⁴ They have said, “Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation,
That the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
⁵ For they have conspired together with one mind;
Against You they make a covenant:
⁶ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites;
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Assyria also has joined with them;
They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah. 
⁹ Deal with them as with Midian,
As with Sisera and Jabin at the torrent of Kishon,
¹⁰ Who were destroyed at En-dor,
Who became as dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb
And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² Who said, “Let us possess for ourselves
The pastures of God.” 
¹³ O my God, make them like the whirling dust,
Like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ Like fire that burns the forest
And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,
¹⁵ So pursue them with Your tempest
And terrify them with Your storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with dishonor,
That they may seek Your name, O Lord.
¹⁷ Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever,
And let them be humiliated and perish,
¹⁸ That they may know that You alone, whose name is the Lord,
Are the Most High over all the earth.
