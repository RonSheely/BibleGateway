¹ God, do not keep silent.
Do not be deaf. Do not be quiet, God. 
² Look! Your enemies are in an uproar,
and those who hate you have raised their head.
³ Against your people they devise deceptive schemes,
and they plot together against the people you treasure.
⁴ They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation,
so the name of Israel will not be remembered anymore.”
⁵ Indeed, with one mind they plot together.
They form an alliance against you—
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
⁸ Even Ashshur has joined with them. Interlude
They have become the arm of the sons of Lot. 
⁹ Do to them as you did to Midian,
as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the stream Kishon.
¹⁰ They perished at Endor.
They became like manure for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb,
all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let us take possession of God’s pastures for ourselves.”
¹³ My God, make them like tumbleweed,
like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ As fire burns the forest,
or as a flame sets the mountains on fire,
¹⁵ so pursue them with your violent wind,
and terrify them with your storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame
so that they will seek your name, O Lord.
¹⁷ May they be ashamed and terrified forever.
May they be disgraced and perish.
¹⁸ Let them know that you, whose name is the Lord,
you alone are the Most High over all the earth.
