¹ Keep not thou silence, O God: be not still, and cease not, O God. 
² For lo, thine enemies make a tumult, and they that hate thee, have lifted up the head. 
³ They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy secret ones. 
⁴ They have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a nation: and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance. 
⁵ For they have consulted together in heart, and have made a league against thee: 
⁶ The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarites: 
⁷ Gebal and Ammon, and Amalek, the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre. 
⁸ Assyria also is joined with them: they have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah. 
⁹ Do thou to them as unto the Midianites: as to Sisera and as to Jabin at the river of Kishon. 
¹⁰ They perished at En Dor, and were dung for the earth. 
¹¹ Make them, even their princes, like Oreb and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmunna, 
¹² Which have said, Let us take for our possession the habitations of God. 
¹³ O my God, make them like unto a wheel, and as the stubble before the wind. 
¹⁴ As the fire burneth the forest, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire: 
¹⁵ So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy Name, O Lord. 
¹⁷ Let them be confounded and troubled forever: yea, let them be put to shame, and perish, 
¹⁸ That they may know that thou, which art calleth Jehovah, art alone, even the most High over all the earth.
