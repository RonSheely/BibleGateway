¹ Do not keep Your silence, O God;
    do not hold Your peace or be still, O God.
² For, look, Your enemies make an uproar,
    and those who hate You have lifted up their heads.
³ They have given crafty counsel against Your people,
    and have consulted against Your treasured ones.
⁴ They have said, “Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation,
    that the name of Israel may be no more remembered.” 
⁵ For they have conspired together;
    they make a covenant against You—
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
    even Moab and the Hagrites;
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
    the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Assyria also is joined with them,
    they are the strength of the descendants of Lot. Selah 
⁹ Do to them as You did to the Midianites,
    as to Sisera and Jabin at the river of Kishon,
¹⁰ who perished at Endor;
    they became as dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
    yes, all their princes as Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let us take for ourselves
    the pastures of God as a possession.” 
¹³ O my God, make them like a tumbleweed,
    as stubble before the wind.
¹⁴ As fire burns a forest,
    and as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
¹⁵ so pursue them with Your storm,
    and make them afraid with Your hurricane.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame,
    that they may seek your name, O Lord. 
¹⁷ Let them be confounded and troubled forever;
    yes, let them be put to shame and perish,
¹⁸ that they may know that You, whose name alone is the Lord,
    are the Most High over all the earth.
