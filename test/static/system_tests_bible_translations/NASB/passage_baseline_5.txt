God, do not remain quiet;
Do not be silent and, God, do not be still.
² For behold, Your enemies make an uproar,
And those who hate You have exalted themselves.
³ They make shrewd plans against Your people,
And conspire together against Your treasured ones.
⁴ They have said, “Come, and let’s wipe them out as a nation,
So that the name of Israel will no longer be remembered.”
⁵ For they have conspired together with one mind;
They make a covenant against You:
⁶ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites;
⁷ Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
⁸ Assyria also has joined them;
They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah 
⁹ Deal with them as with Midian,
As with Sisera and Jabin at the river of Kishon,
¹⁰ Who were destroyed at En-dor,
Who became like dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
And all their leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² Who said, “Let’s possess for ourselves
The pastures of God.” 
¹³ My God, make them like the whirling dust,
Like chaff before the wind.
¹⁴ Like fire that burns the forest,
And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,
¹⁵ So pursue them with Your heavy gale,
And terrify them with Your storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with dishonor,
So that they will seek Your name, Lord.
¹⁷ May they be ashamed and dismayed forever,
And may they be humiliated and perish,
¹⁸ So that they will know that You alone, whose name is the Lord,
Are the Most High over all the earth.
