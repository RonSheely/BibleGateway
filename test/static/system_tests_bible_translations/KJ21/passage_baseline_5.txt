Keep Thou not silence, O God; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
² For lo, Thine enemies make a tumult, and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. 
³ They have taken crafty counsel against Thy people, and consulted against Thy hidden ones. 
⁴ They have said, “Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.” 
⁵ For they have consulted together with one accord; they are confederate against Thee: 
⁶ the tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagarites, 
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre. 
⁸ Assyria also has joined with them; they have helped the children of Lot. Selah 
⁹ Do unto them as unto the Midianites, as to Sisera, as to Jabin at the Brook of Kishon, 
¹⁰ who perished at Endor; they became as dung for the earth. 
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, yea, all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna, 
¹² who said, “Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.” 
¹³ O my God, make them like a wheel, as the stubble before the wind. 
¹⁴ As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire, 
¹⁵ so persecute them with Thy tempest, and make them afraid with Thy storm. 
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Thy name, O Lord. 
¹⁷ Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame and perish, 
¹⁸ that men may know that Thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.
