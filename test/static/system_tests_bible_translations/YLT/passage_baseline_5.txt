A Song, -- A Psalm of Asaph. O God, let there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God. 
² For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have lifted up the head, 
³ Against Thy people they take crafty counsel, And consult against Thy hidden ones. 
⁴ They have said, `Come, And we cut them off from [being] a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.' 
⁵ For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a covenant they make, 
⁶ Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes, 
⁷ Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre, 
⁸ Asshur also is joined with them, They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah. 
⁹ Do to them as [to] Midian, As [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin, at the stream Kishon. 
¹⁰ They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the ground! 
¹¹ Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes, 
¹² Who have said, `Let us occupy for ourselves The comely places of God.' 
¹³ O my God, make them as a rolling thing, As stubble before wind. 
¹⁴ As a fire doth burn a forest, And as a flame setteth hills on fire, 
¹⁵ So dost Thou pursue them with Thy whirlwind, And with Thy hurricane troublest them. 
¹⁶ Fill their faces [with] shame, And they seek Thy name, O Jehovah. 
¹⁷ They are ashamed and troubled for ever, Yea, they are confounded and lost. 
¹⁸ And they know that Thou -- (Thy name [is] Jehovah -- by Thyself,) [Art] the Most High over all the earth!
