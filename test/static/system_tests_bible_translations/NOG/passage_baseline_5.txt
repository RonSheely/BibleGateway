¹ O Elohim, do not remain silent.
    Do not turn a deaf ear to me.
    Do not keep quiet, O El. 
² Look, your enemies are in an uproar.
    Those who hate you hold their heads high.
³         They make plans in secret against your people
            and plot together against those you treasure.
⁴         They say, “Let’s wipe out their nation
            so that the name of Israel will no longer be remembered.”
⁵         They agree completely on their plan.
        They form an alliance against you:
⁶             the tents from Edom and Ishmael,
            Moab and Hagar,
⁷             Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
            Philistia, along with those who live in Tyre.
⁸             Even Assyria has joined them.
                They helped the descendants of Lot. Selah
⁹ Do to them what you did to Midian,
    to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
¹⁰ They were destroyed at Endor.
    They became manure to fertilize the ground.
¹¹ Treat their influential people as you treated Oreb and Zeeb.
    Treat all their leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna.
¹² They said, “Let’s take Elohim’s pasturelands for ourselves.”
¹³ O my Elohim, blow them away like tumbleweeds,
    like husks in the wind.
¹⁴ Pursue them with your storms,
    and terrify them with your windstorms
¹⁵ the way fire burns a forest
    and flames set mountains on fire.
¹⁶ Let their faces blush with shame, O Yahweh,
    so that they must look to you for help.
¹⁷ Let them be put to shame and terrified forever.
    Let them die in disgrace
¹⁸ so that they must acknowledge you.
    Your name is Yahweh.
        You alone are Elyon of the whole earth.
