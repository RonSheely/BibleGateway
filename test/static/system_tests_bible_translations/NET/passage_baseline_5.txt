O God, do not be silent.
Do not ignore us. Do not be inactive, O God.
² For look, your enemies are making a commotion;
those who hate you are hostile.
³ They carefully plot against your people,
and make plans to harm the ones you cherish.
⁴ They say, “Come on, let’s annihilate them so they are no longer a nation.
Then the name of Israel will be remembered no more.”
⁵ Yes, they devise a unified strategy;
they form an alliance against you.
⁶ It includes the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.
⁸ Even Assyria has allied with them,
lending its strength to the descendants of Lot. (Selah)
⁹ Do to them as you did to Midian—
as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
¹⁰ They were destroyed at Endor;
their corpses were like manure on the ground.
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let’s take over the pastures of God.”
¹³ O my God, make them like dead thistles,
like dead weeds blown away by the wind.
¹⁴ Like the fire that burns down the forest,
or the flames that consume the mountainsides,
¹⁵ chase them with your gale winds,
and terrify them with your windstorm.
¹⁶ Cover their faces with shame,
so they might seek you, O Lord.
¹⁷ May they be humiliated and continually terrified.
May they die in shame.
¹⁸ Then they will know that you alone are the Lord,
the Most High over all the earth.
