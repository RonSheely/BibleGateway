¹ Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
² For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
³ They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. 
⁴ They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
⁵ For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: 
⁶ The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
⁷ Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
⁸ Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 
⁹ Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 
¹⁰ Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the earth. 
¹¹ Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 
¹² Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 
¹³ O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 
¹⁴ As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 
¹⁵ So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O Lord. 
¹⁷ Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 
¹⁸ That men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high over all the earth.
