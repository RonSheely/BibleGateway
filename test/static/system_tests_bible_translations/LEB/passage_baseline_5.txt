O God, do not rest silently.
Do not keep silent or be still, O God.
² For look, your enemies roar,
and those who hate you have lifted their head.
³ They devise cunning schemes against your people,
and consult together against your protected ones.
⁴ They say, “Come, let us annihilate them from being a nation,
so that the name of Israel will be remembered no more.”
⁵ For they have consulted together with a unified purpose.
They have made a covenant against you:
⁶ the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
⁸ Assyria also has joined with them.
They provide help to the children of Lot. Selah
⁹ Do to them as you did with Midian,
as with Sisera, as with Jabin at the wadi of Kishon.
¹⁰ They were destroyed at En-dor;
they became dung for the ground.
¹¹ Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeeb,
and all their chiefs like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let us take as our possession
the pastures of God.”
¹³ O my God, make them like the tumbleweed,
like the chaff before wind.
¹⁴ As fire burns a forest,
and as a flame sets afire mountains,
¹⁵ so pursue them with your tempest
and terrify them with your storm.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame,
that they may seek your name, O Yahweh.
¹⁷ Let them be ashamed and terrified forever,
and let them be humiliated and perish
¹⁸ that they may know that you,
whose name is Yahweh, you alone,
are the Most High over the whole earth.
