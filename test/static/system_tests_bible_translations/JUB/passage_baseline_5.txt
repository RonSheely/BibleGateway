¹ Do not keep silence, O God; do not hold thy peace, and do not be still, O God. 
² For, behold, thine enemies make a tumult, and those that hate thee have lifted up their head. 
³ They have taken prudent counsel in secret against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones. 
⁴ They have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a people that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
⁵ Therefore they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee: 
⁶ The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; of Moab and the Hagarenes; 
⁷ Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
⁸ Assur also is joined with them: they are an arm unto the sons of Lot. Selah. 
⁹ Do unto them as unto the Midianites, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison, 
¹⁰ who perished at Endor; they became as dung for the earth. 
¹¹ Make them and their captains like Oreb and like Zeeb; all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna: 
¹² Who have said, Let us inherit for ourselves the habitations of God. 
¹³ O my God, make them like a whirlwind, as the stubble before the wind. 
¹⁴ As the fire burns a wood and as the flame sets the mountains on fire 
¹⁵ so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy whirlwind. 
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 
¹⁷ Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; let them be put to shame and perish 
¹⁸ That they may know that thou, whose name alone is LORD, art the most high over all the earth.
