God, do not rest!
    Don’t be silent!
        Don’t stay inactive, God!
² See! Your enemies rage;
    those who hate you issue threats.
³ They plot against your people
    and conspire against your cherished ones.
⁴ They say, “Let us go and erase them as a nation
    so the name of Israel will not be remembered anymore.” 
⁵ Indeed, they shrewdly planned together,
    forming an alliance against you—
⁶ the tents of Edom, the Ishmaelites,
    Moab, the Hagrites,
⁷ Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, Philistia,
    and the inhabitants of Tyre.
⁸ Even Assyria joined them
    to strengthen the descendants of Lot.
 Interlude 
⁹ Deal with them as you did to Midian,
    Sisera, and Jabin at the Kishon Brook.
¹⁰ They were destroyed at En-dor
    and became as dung on the ground.
¹¹ Punish their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
    and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
¹² who said, “Let us possess the pastures of God.” 
¹³ God, set them up like dried thistles,
    like straw before the wind.
¹⁴ Like a fire burning a forest,
    and a flame setting mountains ablaze.
¹⁵ Pursue them with your storm and
    terrify them with your whirlwind.
¹⁶ Fill their faces with shame
    until they seek your name, God.
¹⁷ Let them be humiliated and terrified permanently
    until they die in shame.
¹⁸ Then they will know that you alone—
    whose name is Lord—
        are the Most High over all the earth.
