Philemon:
  1:
    1: "¹ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon\
      \ our dear friend and fellow worker— "
    2: "² also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church\
      \ that meets in your home: \n"
    3: "³ Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    4: '⁴ I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, '
    5: '⁵ because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in
      the Lord Jesus. '
    6: '⁶ I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening
      your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. '
    7: "⁷ Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother,\
      \ have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people. \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you
      ought to do, '
    9: '⁹ yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other
      than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— '
    10: '¹⁰ that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was
      in chains. '
    11: "¹¹ Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you\
      \ and to me. \n"
    12: '¹² I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. '
    13: '¹³ I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place
      in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. '
    14: '¹⁴ But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor
      you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. '
    15: '¹⁵ Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that
      you might have him back forever— '
    16: "¹⁶ no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is\
      \ very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother\
      \ in the Lord. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. '
    18: '¹⁸ If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. '
    19: '¹⁹ I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention
      that you owe me your very self. '
    20: '²⁰ I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord;
      refresh my heart in Christ. '
    21: "²¹ Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do\
      \ even more than I ask. \n"
    22: "²² And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be\
      \ restored to you in answer to your prayers. \n"
    23: '²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. '
    24: "²⁴ And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. \n"
    25: ²⁵ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
