Ecclesiastes:
  '1':
    '1': "¹ The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem: \n"
    '2': '² “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” '
    '3': '³ What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun? '
    '4': '⁴ One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains
      forever. '
    '5': '⁵ The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where
      it rises. '
    '6': '⁶ The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns
      around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses. '
    '7': '⁷ All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place
      where the rivers flow, there they flow again. '
    '8': '⁸ All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied
      with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. '
    '9': '⁹ That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done
      is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. '
    '10': '¹⁰ Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold, this is new?” It
      has been long ago, in the ages which were before us. '
    '11': "¹¹ There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory\
      \ of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after. \n"
    '12': '¹² I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. '
    '13': '¹³ I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all
      that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons
      of men to be afflicted with. '
    '14': '¹⁴ I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all
      is vanity and a chasing after wind. '
    '15': '¹⁵ That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking
      can’t be counted. '
    '16': '¹⁶ I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above
      all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience
      of wisdom and knowledge.” '
    '17': '¹⁷ I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I
      perceived that this also was a chasing after wind. '
    '18': ¹⁸ For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases
      sorrow.
