1 John:
  5:
    1: '¹ Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. Whoever
      loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him. '
    2: '² By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep
      his commandments. '
    3: '³ For this is loving God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments
      are not grievous. '
    4: '⁴ For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that
      has overcome the world: your faith. '
    5: '⁵ Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the
      Son of God? '
    6: '⁶ This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water
      only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because
      the Spirit is the truth. '
    7: '⁷ For there are three who testify: '
    8: '⁸ the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one. '
    9: '⁹ If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this
      is God’s testimony which he has testified concerning his Son. '
    10: '¹⁰ He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who
      doesn’t believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the
      testimony that God has given concerning his Son. '
    11: '¹¹ The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life
      is in his Son. '
    12: "¹² He who has the Son has the life. He who doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t\
      \ have the life. \n"
    13: "¹³ These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son\
      \ of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue\
      \ to believe in the name of the Son of God. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ This is the boldness which we have toward him, that if we ask anything
      according to his will, he listens to us. '
    15: "¹⁵ And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we\
      \ have the petitions which we have asked of him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall
      ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death. There
      is a sin leading to death. I don’t say that he should make a request concerning
      this. '
    17: "¹⁷ All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ We know that whoever is born of God doesn’t sin, but he who was born of
      God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn’t touch him. '
    19: '¹⁹ We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the
      evil one. '
    20: "²⁰ We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding,\
      \ that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus\
      \ Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. \n"
    21: ²¹ Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
