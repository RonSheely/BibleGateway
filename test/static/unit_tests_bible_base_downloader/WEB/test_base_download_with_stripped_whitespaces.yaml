Philemon:
  1:
    1: ¹ Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
    2: '² to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:'
    3: ³ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    4: ⁴ I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
    5: ⁵ hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
    6: ⁶ that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.
    7: ⁷ For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
    8: ⁸ Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,
    9: ⁹ yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
    10: ¹⁰ I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,
    11: ¹¹ who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
    12: ¹² I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
    13: ¹³ whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
    14: ¹⁴ But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.
    15: ¹⁵ For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever,
    16: ¹⁶ no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
    17: ¹⁷ If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
    18: ¹⁸ But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.
    19: '¹⁹ I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).'
    20: ²⁰ Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
    21: ²¹ Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
    22: ²² Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
    23: ²³ Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
    24: ²⁴ as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
    25: ²⁵ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
