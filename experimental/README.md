# Technical Experiments

This directory contains scripts that utilise this library to explore potential new functionalities that could be added as supported features, as well as housing experimental utility scripts intended to make development work easier.

**Use these scripts at your own discretion!** They may not always work in all situations, might not perform consistently and may not even be valid Python.

Note: To run these scripts from the command line, it is recommended that this folder is the working directory.
