Micah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of\
      \ Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria\
      \ and Jerusalem. \n"
    2: "² Hear, you peoples, all of you,\n    listen, earth and all who live in it,\n\
      that the Sovereign Lord may bear witness against you,\n    the Lord from his\
      \ holy temple. \n"
    3: "³ Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place;\n    he comes down and\
      \ treads on the heights of the earth.\n"
    4: "⁴ The mountains melt beneath him\n    and the valleys split apart,\nlike wax\
      \ before the fire,\n    like water rushing down a slope.\n"
    5: "⁵ All this is because of Jacob’s transgression,\n    because of the sins of\
      \ the people of Israel.\nWhat is Jacob’s transgression?\n    Is it not Samaria?\n\
      What is Judah’s high place?\n    Is it not Jerusalem? \n"
    6: "⁶ “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble,\n    a place for planting\
      \ vineyards.\nI will pour her stones into the valley\n    and lay bare her foundations.\n"
    7: "⁷ All her idols will be broken to pieces;\n    all her temple gifts will be\
      \ burned with fire;\n    I will destroy all her images.\nSince she gathered\
      \ her gifts from the wages of prostitutes,\n    as the wages of prostitutes\
      \ they will again be used.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Because of this I will weep and wail;\n    I will go about barefoot and\
      \ naked.\nI will howl like a jackal\n    and moan like an owl.\n"
    9: "⁹ For Samaria’s plague is incurable;\n    it has spread to Judah.\nIt has\
      \ reached the very gate of my people,\n    even to Jerusalem itself.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell it not in Gath;\n    weep not at all.\nIn Beth Ophrah\n    roll in\
      \ the dust.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Pass by naked and in shame,\n    you who live in Shaphir.\nThose who live\
      \ in Zaanan\n    will not come out.\nBeth Ezel is in mourning;\n    it no longer\
      \ protects you.\n"
    12: "¹² Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain,\n    waiting for relief,\nbecause\
      \ disaster has come from the Lord,\n    even to the gate of Jerusalem.\n"
    13: "¹³ You who live in Lachish,\n    harness fast horses to the chariot.\nYou\
      \ are where the sin of Daughter Zion began,\n    for the transgressions of Israel\
      \ were found in you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore you will give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth Gath.\nThe town\
      \ of Akzib will prove deceptive\n    to the kings of Israel.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will bring a conqueror against you\n    who live in Mareshah.\nThe nobles\
      \ of Israel\n    will flee to Adullam.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Shave your head in mourning\n    for the children in whom you delight;\n\
      make yourself as bald as the vulture,\n    for they will go from you into exile."
  2:
    1: "¹ Woe to those who plan iniquity,\n    to those who plot evil on their beds!\n\
      At morning’s light they carry it out\n    because it is in their power to do\
      \ it.\n"
    2: "² They covet fields and seize them,\n    and houses, and take them.\nThey\
      \ defraud people of their homes,\n    they rob them of their inheritance. \n"
    3: "³ Therefore, the Lord says:\n“I am planning disaster against this people,\n\
      \    from which you cannot save yourselves.\nYou will no longer walk proudly,\n\
      \    for it will be a time of calamity.\n"
    4: "⁴ In that day people will ridicule you;\n    they will taunt you with this\
      \ mournful song:\n‘We are utterly ruined;\n    my people’s possession is divided\
      \ up.\nHe takes it from me!\n    He assigns our fields to traitors.’” \n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the Lord\n    to divide\
      \ the land by lot. \n"
    6: "⁶ “Do not prophesy,” their prophets say.\n    “Do not prophesy about these\
      \ things;\n    disgrace will not overtake us.”\n"
    7: "⁷ You descendants of Jacob, should it be said,\n    “Does the Lord become\
      \ impatient?\n    Does he do such things?”\n“Do not my words do good\n    to\
      \ the one whose ways are upright?\n"
    8: "⁸ Lately my people have risen up\n    like an enemy.\nYou strip off the rich\
      \ robe\n    from those who pass by without a care,\n    like men returning from\
      \ battle.\n"
    9: "⁹ You drive the women of my people\n    from their pleasant homes.\nYou take\
      \ away my blessing\n    from their children forever.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Get up, go away!\n    For this is not your resting place,\nbecause it\
      \ is defiled,\n    it is ruined, beyond all remedy.\n"
    11: "¹¹ If a liar and deceiver comes and says,\n    ‘I will prophesy for you plenty\
      \ of wine and beer,’\n    that would be just the prophet for this people! \n"
    12: "¹² “I will surely gather all of you, Jacob;\n    I will surely bring together\
      \ the remnant of Israel.\nI will bring them together like sheep in a pen,\n\
      \    like a flock in its pasture;\n    the place will throng with people.\n"
    13: "¹³ The One who breaks open the way will go up before them;\n    they will\
      \ break through the gate and go out.\nTheir King will pass through before them,\n\
      \    the Lord at their head.”"
  3:
    1: "¹ Then I said,\n“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,\n    you rulers of Israel.\n\
      Should you not embrace justice,\n"
    2: "²     you who hate good and love evil;\nwho tear the skin from my people\n\
      \    and the flesh from their bones;\n"
    3: "³ who eat my people’s flesh,\n    strip off their skin\n    and break their\
      \ bones in pieces;\nwho chop them up like meat for the pan,\n    like flesh\
      \ for the pot?” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then they will cry out to the Lord,\n    but he will not answer them.\n\
      At that time he will hide his face from them\n    because of the evil they have\
      \ done. \n"
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“As for the prophets\n    who lead my people\
      \ astray,\nthey proclaim ‘peace’\n    if they have something to eat,\nbut prepare\
      \ to wage war against anyone\n    who refuses to feed them.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore night will come over you, without visions,\n    and darkness,\
      \ without divination.\nThe sun will set for the prophets,\n    and the day will\
      \ go dark for them.\n"
    7: "⁷ The seers will be ashamed\n    and the diviners disgraced.\nThey will all\
      \ cover their faces\n    because there is no answer from God.”\n"
    8: "⁸ But as for me, I am filled with power,\n    with the Spirit of the Lord,\n\
      \    and with justice and might,\nto declare to Jacob his transgression,\n \
      \   to Israel his sin. \n"
    9: "⁹ Hear this, you leaders of Jacob,\n    you rulers of Israel,\nwho despise\
      \ justice\n    and distort all that is right;\n"
    10: "¹⁰ who build Zion with bloodshed,\n    and Jerusalem with wickedness.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Her leaders judge for a bribe,\n    her priests teach for a price,\n \
      \   and her prophets tell fortunes for money.\nYet they look for the Lord’s\
      \ support and say,\n    “Is not the Lord among us?\n    No disaster will come\
      \ upon us.”\n"
    12: "¹² Therefore because of you,\n    Zion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem\
      \ will become a heap of rubble,\n    the temple hill a mound overgrown with\
      \ thickets."
  4:
    1: "¹ In the last days\nthe mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established\n\
      \    as the highest of the mountains;\nit will be exalted above the hills,\n\
      \    and peoples will stream to it. \n"
    2: "² Many nations will come and say,\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain of\
      \ the Lord,\n    to the temple of the God of Jacob.\nHe will teach us his ways,\n\
      \    so that we may walk in his paths.”\nThe law will go out from Zion,\n  \
      \  the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    3: "³ He will judge between many peoples\n    and will settle disputes for strong\
      \ nations far and wide.\nThey will beat their swords into plowshares\n    and\
      \ their spears into pruning hooks.\nNation will not take up sword against nation,\n\
      \    nor will they train for war anymore.\n"
    4: "⁴ Everyone will sit under their own vine\n    and under their own fig tree,\n\
      and no one will make them afraid,\n    for the Lord Almighty has spoken.\n"
    5: "⁵ All the nations may walk\n    in the name of their gods,\nbut we will walk\
      \ in the name of the Lord\n    our God for ever and ever. \n"
    6: "⁶ “In that day,” declares the Lord,\n“I will gather the lame;\n    I will\
      \ assemble the exiles\n    and those I have brought to grief.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will make the lame my remnant,\n    those driven away a strong nation.\n\
      The Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion\n    from that day and forever.\n"
    8: "⁸ As for you, watchtower of the flock,\n    stronghold of Daughter Zion,\n\
      the former dominion will be restored to you;\n    kingship will come to Daughter\
      \ Jerusalem.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Why do you now cry aloud—\n    have you no king?\nHas your ruler perished,\n\
      \    that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion,\n    like a woman in labor,\nfor now you\
      \ must leave the city\n    to camp in the open field.\nYou will go to Babylon;\n\
      \    there you will be rescued.\nThere the Lord will redeem you\n    out of\
      \ the hand of your enemies. \n"
    11: "¹¹ But now many nations\n    are gathered against you.\nThey say, “Let her\
      \ be defiled,\n    let our eyes gloat over Zion!”\n"
    12: "¹² But they do not know\n    the thoughts of the Lord;\nthey do not understand\
      \ his plan,\n    that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.\n"
    13: "¹³ “Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion,\n    for I will give you horns of iron;\n\
      I will give you hooves of bronze,\n    and you will break to pieces many nations.”\n\
      You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the Lord,\n    their wealth to the\
      \ Lord of all the earth."
  5:
    1: "¹ Marshal your troops now, city of troops,\n    for a siege is laid against\
      \ us.\nThey will strike Israel’s ruler\n    on the cheek with a rod. \n"
    2: "² “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,\n    though you are small among the clans\
      \ of Judah,\nout of you will come for me\n    one who will be ruler over Israel,\n\
      whose origins are from of old,\n    from ancient times.” \n"
    3: "³ Therefore Israel will be abandoned\n    until the time when she who is in\
      \ labor bears a son,\nand the rest of his brothers return\n    to join the Israelites.\
      \ \n"
    4: "⁴ He will stand and shepherd his flock\n    in the strength of the Lord,\n\
      \    in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God.\nAnd they will live securely,\
      \ for then his greatness\n    will reach to the ends of the earth. \n"
    5: "⁵ And he will be our peace\n    when the Assyrians invade our land\n    and\
      \ march through our fortresses.\nWe will raise against them seven shepherds,\n\
      \    even eight commanders,\n"
    6: "⁶ who will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,\n    the land of Nimrod\
      \ with drawn sword.\nHe will deliver us from the Assyrians\n    when they invade\
      \ our land\n    and march across our borders. \n"
    7: "⁷ The remnant of Jacob will be\n    in the midst of many peoples\nlike dew\
      \ from the Lord,\n    like showers on the grass,\nwhich do not wait for anyone\n\
      \    or depend on man.\n"
    8: "⁸ The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,\n    in the midst of many\
      \ peoples,\nlike a lion among the beasts of the forest,\n    like a young lion\
      \ among flocks of sheep,\nwhich mauls and mangles as it goes,\n    and no one\
      \ can rescue.\n"
    9: "⁹ Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies,\n    and all your\
      \ foes will be destroyed. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “In that day,” declares the Lord,\n“I will destroy your horses from among\
      \ you\n    and demolish your chariots.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will destroy the cities of your land\n    and tear down all your strongholds.\n"
    12: "¹² I will destroy your witchcraft\n    and you will no longer cast spells.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will destroy your idols\n    and your sacred stones from among you;\n\
      you will no longer bow down\n    to the work of your hands.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles\n    when I demolish your\
      \ cities.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I will take vengeance in anger and wrath\n    on the nations that have\
      \ not obeyed me.”"
  6:
    1: "¹ Listen to what the Lord says:\n“Stand up, plead my case before the mountains;\n\
      \    let the hills hear what you have to say. \n"
    2: "² “Hear, you mountains, the Lord’s accusation;\n    listen, you everlasting\
      \ foundations of the earth.\nFor the Lord has a case against his people;\n \
      \   he is lodging a charge against Israel. \n"
    3: "³ “My people, what have I done to you?\n    How have I burdened you? Answer\
      \ me.\n"
    4: "⁴ I brought you up out of Egypt\n    and redeemed you from the land of slavery.\n\
      I sent Moses to lead you,\n    also Aaron and Miriam.\n"
    5: "⁵ My people, remember\n    what Balak king of Moab plotted\n    and what Balaam\
      \ son of Beor answered.\nRemember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal,\n   \
      \ that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.” \n"
    6: "⁶ With what shall I come before the Lord\n    and bow down before the exalted\
      \ God?\nShall I come before him with burnt offerings,\n    with calves a year\
      \ old?\n"
    7: "⁷ Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,\n    with ten thousand\
      \ rivers of olive oil?\nShall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,\n \
      \   the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\n"
    8: "⁸ He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.\n    And what does the Lord require\
      \ of you?\nTo act justly and to love mercy\n    and to walk humbly with your\
      \ God. \n"
    9: "⁹ Listen! The Lord is calling to the city—\n    and to fear your name is wisdom—\n\
      \    “Heed the rod and the One who appointed it.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house,\n  \
      \  and the short ephah, which is accursed?\n"
    11: "¹¹ Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales,\n    with a bag of false\
      \ weights?\n"
    12: "¹² Your rich people are violent;\n    your inhabitants are liars\n    and\
      \ their tongues speak deceitfully.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore, I have begun to destroy you,\n    to ruin you because of your\
      \ sins.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ You will eat but not be satisfied;\n    your stomach will still be empty.\n\
      You will store up but save nothing,\n    because what you save I will give to\
      \ the sword.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You will plant but not harvest;\n    you will press olives but not use\
      \ the oil,\n    you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You have observed the statutes of Omri\n    and all the practices of Ahab’s\
      \ house;\n    you have followed their traditions.\nTherefore I will give you\
      \ over to ruin\n    and your people to derision;\n    you will bear the scorn\
      \ of the nations.”"
  7:
    1: "¹ What misery is mine!\nI am like one who gathers summer fruit\n    at the\
      \ gleaning of the vineyard;\nthere is no cluster of grapes to eat,\n    none\
      \ of the early figs that I crave.\n"
    2: "² The faithful have been swept from the land;\n    not one upright person\
      \ remains.\nEveryone lies in wait to shed blood;\n    they hunt each other with\
      \ nets.\n"
    3: "³ Both hands are skilled in doing evil;\n    the ruler demands gifts,\nthe\
      \ judge accepts bribes,\n    the powerful dictate what they desire—\n    they\
      \ all conspire together.\n"
    4: "⁴ The best of them is like a brier,\n    the most upright worse than a thorn\
      \ hedge.\nThe day God visits you has come,\n    the day your watchmen sound\
      \ the alarm.\n    Now is the time of your confusion.\n"
    5: "⁵ Do not trust a neighbor;\n    put no confidence in a friend.\nEven with\
      \ the woman who lies in your embrace\n    guard the words of your lips.\n"
    6: "⁶ For a son dishonors his father,\n    a daughter rises up against her mother,\n\
      a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—\n    a man’s enemies are the members\
      \ of his own household. \n"
    7: "⁷ But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord,\n    I wait for God my Savior;\n\
      \    my God will hear me. \n"
    8: "⁸ Do not gloat over me, my enemy!\n    Though I have fallen, I will rise.\n\
      Though I sit in darkness,\n    the Lord will be my light.\n"
    9: "⁹ Because I have sinned against him,\n    I will bear the Lord’s wrath,\n\
      until he pleads my case\n    and upholds my cause.\nHe will bring me out into\
      \ the light;\n    I will see his righteousness.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then my enemy will see it\n    and will be covered with shame,\nshe who\
      \ said to me,\n    “Where is the Lord your God?”\nMy eyes will see her downfall;\n\
      \    even now she will be trampled underfoot\n    like mire in the streets.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ The day for building your walls will come,\n    the day for extending\
      \ your boundaries.\n"
    12: "¹² In that day people will come to you\n    from Assyria and the cities of\
      \ Egypt,\neven from Egypt to the Euphrates\n    and from sea to sea\n    and\
      \ from mountain to mountain.\n"
    13: "¹³ The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants,\n    as the\
      \ result of their deeds. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Shepherd your people with your staff,\n    the flock of your inheritance,\n\
      which lives by itself in a forest,\n    in fertile pasturelands.\nLet them feed\
      \ in Bashan and Gilead\n    as in days long ago. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “As in the days when you came out of Egypt,\n    I will show them my wonders.”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Nations will see and be ashamed,\n    deprived of all their power.\nThey\
      \ will put their hands over their mouths\n    and their ears will become deaf.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They will lick dust like a snake,\n    like creatures that crawl on the\
      \ ground.\nThey will come trembling out of their dens;\n    they will turn in\
      \ fear to the Lord our God\n    and will be afraid of you.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Who is a God like you,\n    who pardons sin and forgives the transgression\n\
      \    of the remnant of his inheritance?\nYou do not stay angry forever\n   \
      \ but delight to show mercy.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ You will again have compassion on us;\n    you will tread our sins underfoot\n\
      \    and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.\n"
    20: "²⁰ You will be faithful to Jacob,\n    and show love to Abraham,\nas you\
      \ pledged on oath to our ancestors\n    in days long ago."
