Phillippians:
  1:
    1: "Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,\nTo all God’s holy people in Christ\
      \ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons: \n"
    2: "² Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n"
    3: '³ I thank my God every time I remember you. '
    4: '⁴ In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy '
    5: '⁵ because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, '
    6: "⁶ being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry\
      \ it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. \n"
    7: '⁷ It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in
      my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel,
      all of you share in God’s grace with me. '
    8: "⁸ God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge
      and depth of insight, '
    10: '¹⁰ so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless
      for the day of Christ, '
    11: "¹¹ filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to\
      \ the glory and praise of God. \n"
    12: '¹² Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to
      me has actually served to advance the gospel. '
    13: '¹³ As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and
      to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. '
    14: "¹⁴ And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become\
      \ confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without\
      \ fear. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others
      out of goodwill. '
    16: '¹⁶ The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense
      of the gospel. '
    17: '¹⁷ The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing
      that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. '
    18: "¹⁸ But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether\
      \ from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.\n\
      Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, "
    19: '¹⁹ for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit
      of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. '
    20: '²⁰ I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have
      sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body,
      whether by life or by death. '
    21: '²¹ For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. '
    22: '²² If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for
      me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! '
    23: '²³ I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which
      is better by far; '
    24: '²⁴ but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. '
    25: '²⁵ Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with
      all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, '
    26: "²⁶ so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus\
      \ will abound on account of me. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel
      of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence,
      I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one
      for the faith of the gospel '
    28: '²⁸ without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a
      sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that
      by God. '
    29: '²⁹ For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe
      in him, but also to suffer for him, '
    30: ³⁰ since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear
      that I still have.
  2:
    1: 'Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if
      any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness
      and compassion, '
    2: '² then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being
      one in spirit and of one mind. '
    3: '³ Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility
      value others above yourselves, '
    4: "⁴ not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the\
      \ others. \n"
    5: "⁵ In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ\
      \ Jesus: \n"
    6: "⁶ Who, being in very nature God,\n    did not consider equality with God something\
      \ to be used to his own advantage;\n"
    7: "⁷ rather, he made himself nothing\n    by taking the very nature of a servant,\n\
      \    being made in human likeness.\n"
    8: "⁸ And being found in appearance as a man,\n    he humbled himself\n    by\
      \ becoming obedient to death—\n        even death on a cross! \n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore God exalted him to the highest place\n    and gave him the name\
      \ that is above every name,\n"
    10: "¹⁰ that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,\n    in heaven and on\
      \ earth and under the earth,\n"
    11: "¹¹ and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,\n    to the glory\
      \ of God the Father. \n"
    12: '¹² Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence,
      but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear
      and trembling, '
    13: "¹³ for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill\
      \ his good purpose. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Do everything without grumbling or arguing, '
    15: '¹⁵ so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault
      in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars
      in the sky '
    16: '¹⁶ as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast
      on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. '
    17: '¹⁷ But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice
      and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. '
    18: "¹⁸ So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may
      be cheered when I receive news about you. '
    20: '²⁰ I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. '
    21: '²¹ For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. '
    22: '²² But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his
      father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. '
    23: '²³ I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. '
    24: "²⁴ And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon. \n"
    25: '²⁵ But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother,
      co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take
      care of my needs. '
    26: '²⁶ For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was
      ill. '
    27: '²⁷ Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not
      on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him
      again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. '
    29: '²⁹ So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like
      him, '
    30: ³⁰ because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make
      up for the help you yourselves could not give me.
  3:
    1: 'Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for
      me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. '
    2: '² Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. '
    3: '³ For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who
      boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— '
    4: "⁴ though I myself have reasons for such confidence.\nIf someone else thinks\
      \ they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: "
    5: '⁵ circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of
      Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; '
    6: "⁶ as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law,\
      \ faultless. \n"
    7: '⁷ But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. '
    8: '⁸ What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth
      of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider
      them garbage, that I may gain Christ '
    9: '⁹ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from
      the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes
      from God on the basis of faith. '
    10: '¹⁰ I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation
      in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, '
    11: "¹¹ and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. \n"
    12: '¹² Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at
      my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold
      of me. '
    13: '¹³ Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold
      of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what
      is ahead, '
    14: "¹⁴ I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me\
      \ heavenward in Christ Jesus. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And
      if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. '
    16: "¹⁶ Only let us live up to what we have already attained. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just
      as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. '
    18: '¹⁸ For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with
      tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. '
    19: '¹⁹ Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory
      is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. '
    20: '²⁰ But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there,
      the Lord Jesus Christ, '
    21: ²¹ who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control,
      will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
  4:
    1: "Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and\
      \ crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends! \n"
    2: '² I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in
      the Lord. '
    3: "³ Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have\
      \ contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the\
      \ rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life. \n"
    4: '⁴ Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! '
    5: '⁵ Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. '
    6: '⁶ Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and
      petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. '
    7: "⁷ And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your\
      \ hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. \n"
    8: '⁸ Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever
      is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything
      is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. '
    9: "⁹ Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put\
      \ it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for
      me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. '
    11: '¹¹ I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content
      whatever the circumstances. '
    12: '¹² I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.
      I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether
      well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. '
    13: "¹³ I can do all this through him who gives me strength. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. '
    15: '¹⁵ Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance
      with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me
      in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; '
    16: '¹⁶ for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when
      I was in need. '
    17: '¹⁷ Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to
      your account. '
    18: '¹⁸ I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied,
      now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant
      offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. '
    19: "¹⁹ And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory\
      \ in Christ Jesus. \n"
    20: "²⁰ To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. \n"
    21: '²¹ Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are
      with me send greetings. '
    22: "²² All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong\
      \ to Caesar’s household. \n"
    23: ²³ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
