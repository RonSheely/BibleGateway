Jeremiah:
  1:
    1: '¹ The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in
      the territory of Benjamin. '
    2: '² The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of
      Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, '
    3: "³ and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to\
      \ the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah,\
      \ when the people of Jerusalem went into exile. \n"
    4: "⁴ The word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n"
    5: "⁵ “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\n    before you were born I\
      \ set you apart;\n    I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” \n"
    6: "⁶ “Alas, Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am too young.”\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ But the Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone
      I send you to and say whatever I command you. '
    8: "⁸ Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    9: '⁹ Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me,
      “I have put my words in your mouth. '
    10: "¹⁰ See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear\
      \ down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ The word of the Lord came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?”\n“I see\
      \ the branch of an almond tree,” I replied. \n"
    12: "¹² The Lord said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching to see\
      \ that my word is fulfilled.” \n"
    13: "¹³ The word of the Lord came to me again: “What do you see?”\n“I see a pot\
      \ that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Lord said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all
      who live in the land. '
    15: "¹⁵ I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares\
      \ the Lord.\n“Their kings will come and set up their thrones\n    in the entrance\
      \ of the gates of Jerusalem;\nthey will come against all her surrounding walls\n\
      \    and against all the towns of Judah.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ I will pronounce my judgments on my people\n    because of their wickedness\
      \ in forsaking me,\nin burning incense to other gods\n    and in worshiping\
      \ what their hands have made. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you.
      Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. '
    18: '¹⁸ Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall
      to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its
      priests and the people of the land. '
    19: ¹⁹ They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you
      and will rescue you,” declares the Lord.
  2:
    1: '¹ The word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: "² “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem:\n“This is what the Lord says:\n\
      “‘I remember the devotion of your youth,\n    how as a bride you loved me\n\
      and followed me through the wilderness,\n    through a land not sown.\n"
    3: "³ Israel was holy to the Lord,\n    the firstfruits of his harvest;\nall who\
      \ devoured her were held guilty,\n    and disaster overtook them,’”\ndeclares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    4: "⁴ Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob,\n    all you clans\
      \ of Israel. \n"
    5: "⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“What fault did your ancestors find in me,\n\
      \    that they strayed so far from me?\nThey followed worthless idols\n    and\
      \ became worthless themselves.\n"
    6: "⁶ They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord,\n    who brought us up out of Egypt\n\
      and led us through the barren wilderness,\n    through a land of deserts and\
      \ ravines,\na land of drought and utter darkness,\n    a land where no one travels\
      \ and no one lives?’\n"
    7: "⁷ I brought you into a fertile land\n    to eat its fruit and rich produce.\n\
      But you came and defiled my land\n    and made my inheritance detestable.\n"
    8: "⁸ The priests did not ask,\n    ‘Where is the Lord?’\nThose who deal with\
      \ the law did not know me;\n    the leaders rebelled against me.\nThe prophets\
      \ prophesied by Baal,\n    following worthless idols. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I bring charges against you again,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n   \
      \ “And I will bring charges against your children’s children.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look,\n    send to Kedar and observe\
      \ closely;\n    see if there has ever been anything like this:\n"
    11: "¹¹ Has a nation ever changed its gods?\n    (Yet they are not gods at all.)\n\
      But my people have exchanged their glorious God\n    for worthless idols.\n"
    12: "¹² Be appalled at this, you heavens,\n    and shudder with great horror,”\n\
      declares the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ “My people have committed two sins:\nThey have forsaken me,\n    the spring\
      \ of living water,\nand have dug their own cisterns,\n    broken cisterns that\
      \ cannot hold water.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth?\n    Why then has he become plunder?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Lions have roared;\n    they have growled at him.\nThey have laid waste\
      \ his land;\n    his towns are burned and deserted.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\n    have cracked your skull.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Have you not brought this on yourselves\n    by forsaking the Lord your\
      \ God\n    when he led you in the way?\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Now why go to Egypt\n    to drink water from the Nile?\nAnd why go to\
      \ Assyria\n    to drink water from the Euphrates?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Your wickedness will punish you;\n    your backsliding will rebuke you.\n\
      Consider then and realize\n    how evil and bitter it is for you\nwhen you forsake\
      \ the Lord your God\n    and have no awe of me,”\ndeclares the Lord, the Lord\
      \ Almighty. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Long ago you broke off your yoke\n    and tore off your bonds;\n    you\
      \ said, ‘I will not serve you!’\nIndeed, on every high hill\n    and under every\
      \ spreading tree\n    you lay down as a prostitute.\n"
    21: "²¹ I had planted you like a choice vine\n    of sound and reliable stock.\n\
      How then did you turn against me\n    into a corrupt, wild vine?\n"
    22: "²² Although you wash yourself with soap\n    and use an abundance of cleansing\
      \ powder,\n    the stain of your guilt is still before me,”\ndeclares the Sovereign\
      \ Lord.\n"
    23: "²³ “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled;\n    I have not run after the Baals’?\n\
      See how you behaved in the valley;\n    consider what you have done.\nYou are\
      \ a swift she-camel\n    running here and there,\n"
    24: "²⁴ a wild donkey accustomed to the desert,\n    sniffing the wind in her\
      \ craving—\n    in her heat who can restrain her?\nAny males that pursue her\
      \ need not tire themselves;\n    at mating time they will find her.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not run until your feet are bare\n    and your throat is dry.\nBut\
      \ you said, ‘It’s no use!\n    I love foreign gods,\n    and I must go after\
      \ them.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “As a thief is disgraced when he is caught,\n    so the people of Israel\
      \ are disgraced—\nthey, their kings and their officials,\n    their priests\
      \ and their prophets.\n"
    27: "²⁷ They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’\n    and to stone, ‘You gave me\
      \ birth.’\nThey have turned their backs to me\n    and not their faces;\nyet\
      \ when they are in trouble, they say,\n    ‘Come and save us!’\n"
    28: "²⁸ Where then are the gods you made for yourselves?\n    Let them come if\
      \ they can save you\n    when you are in trouble!\nFor you, Judah, have as many\
      \ gods\n    as you have towns. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Why do you bring charges against me?\n    You have all rebelled against\
      \ me,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    30: "³⁰ “In vain I punished your people;\n    they did not respond to correction.\n\
      Your sword has devoured your prophets\n    like a ravenous lion. \n"
    31: "³¹ “You of this generation, consider the word of the Lord:\n“Have I been\
      \ a desert to Israel\n    or a land of great darkness?\nWhy do my people say,\
      \ ‘We are free to roam;\n    we will come to you no more’?\n"
    32: "³² Does a young woman forget her jewelry,\n    a bride her wedding ornaments?\n\
      Yet my people have forgotten me,\n    days without number.\n"
    33: "³³ How skilled you are at pursuing love!\n    Even the worst of women can\
      \ learn from your ways.\n"
    34: "³⁴ On your clothes is found\n    the lifeblood of the innocent poor,\n  \
      \  though you did not catch them breaking in.\nYet in spite of all this\n"
    35: "³⁵     you say, ‘I am innocent;\n    he is not angry with me.’\nBut I will\
      \ pass judgment on you\n    because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’\n"
    36: "³⁶ Why do you go about so much,\n    changing your ways?\nYou will be disappointed\
      \ by Egypt\n    as you were by Assyria.\n"
    37: "³⁷ You will also leave that place\n    with your hands on your head,\nfor\
      \ the Lord has rejected those you trust;\n    you will not be helped by them."
  3:
    1: "¹ “If a man divorces his wife\n    and she leaves him and marries another\
      \ man,\nshould he return to her again?\n    Would not the land be completely\
      \ defiled?\nBut you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers—\n    would\
      \ you now return to me?”\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    2: "² “Look up to the barren heights and see.\n    Is there any place where you\
      \ have not been ravished?\nBy the roadside you sat waiting for lovers,\n   \
      \ sat like a nomad in the desert.\nYou have defiled the land\n    with your\
      \ prostitution and wickedness.\n"
    3: "³ Therefore the showers have been withheld,\n    and no spring rains have\
      \ fallen.\nYet you have the brazen look of a prostitute;\n    you refuse to\
      \ blush with shame.\n"
    4: "⁴ Have you not just called to me:\n    ‘My Father, my friend from my youth,\n"
    5: "⁵ will you always be angry?\n    Will your wrath continue forever?’\nThis\
      \ is how you talk,\n    but you do all the evil you can.” \n"
    6: '⁶ During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, “Have you seen what
      faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every
      spreading tree and has committed adultery there. '
    7: '⁷ I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she
      did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. '
    8: '⁸ I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because
      of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear;
      she also went out and committed adultery. '
    9: '⁹ Because Israel’s immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land
      and committed adultery with stone and wood. '
    10: "¹⁰ In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me\
      \ with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the Lord. \n"
    11: '¹¹ The Lord said to me, “Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful
      Judah. '
    12: "¹² Go, proclaim this message toward the north:\n“‘Return, faithless Israel,’\
      \ declares the Lord,\n    ‘I will frown on you no longer,\nfor I am faithful,’\
      \ declares the Lord,\n    ‘I will not be angry forever.\n"
    13: "¹³ Only acknowledge your guilt—\n    you have rebelled against the Lord your\
      \ God,\nyou have scattered your favors to foreign gods\n    under every spreading\
      \ tree,\n    and have not obeyed me,’”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “Return, faithless people,” declares the Lord, “for I am your husband.
      I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion. '
    15: '¹⁵ Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with
      knowledge and understanding. '
    16: '¹⁶ In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,”
      declares the Lord, “people will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the
      Lord.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed,
      nor will another one be made. '
    17: '¹⁷ At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord, and all
      nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the Lord. No longer will
      they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts. '
    18: "¹⁸ In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and\
      \ together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors\
      \ as an inheritance. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I myself said,\n“‘How gladly would I treat you like my children\n   \
      \ and give you a pleasant land,\n    the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.’\n\
      I thought you would call me ‘Father’\n    and not turn away from following me.\n"
    20: "²⁰ But like a woman unfaithful to her husband,\n    so you, Israel, have\
      \ been unfaithful to me,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ A cry is heard on the barren heights,\n    the weeping and pleading of\
      \ the people of Israel,\nbecause they have perverted their ways\n    and have\
      \ forgotten the Lord their God. \n"
    22: "²² “Return, faithless people;\n    I will cure you of backsliding.”\n“Yes,\
      \ we will come to you,\n    for you are the Lord our God.\n"
    23: "²³ Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills\n    and mountains is a deception;\n\
      surely in the Lord our God\n    is the salvation of Israel.\n"
    24: "²⁴ From our youth shameful gods have consumed\n    the fruits of our ancestors’\
      \ labor—\ntheir flocks and herds,\n    their sons and daughters.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Let us lie down in our shame,\n    and let our disgrace cover us.\nWe\
      \ have sinned against the Lord our God,\n    both we and our ancestors;\nfrom\
      \ our youth till this day\n    we have not obeyed the Lord our God.”"
  4:
    1: "¹ “If you, Israel, will return,\n    then return to me,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n\
      “If you put your detestable idols out of my sight\n    and no longer go astray,\n"
    2: "² and if in a truthful, just and righteous way\n    you swear, ‘As surely\
      \ as the Lord lives,’\nthen the nations will invoke blessings by him\n    and\
      \ in him they will boast.” \n"
    3: "³ This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem:\n“Break\
      \ up your unplowed ground\n    and do not sow among thorns.\n"
    4: "⁴ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord,\n    circumcise your hearts,\n    you\
      \ people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nor my wrath will flare up and\
      \ burn like fire\n    because of the evil you have done—\n    burn with no one\
      \ to quench it. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say:\n    ‘Sound the trumpet\
      \ throughout the land!’\nCry aloud and say:\n    ‘Gather together!\n    Let\
      \ us flee to the fortified cities!’\n"
    6: "⁶ Raise the signal to go to Zion!\n    Flee for safety without delay!\nFor\
      \ I am bringing disaster from the north,\n    even terrible destruction.” \n"
    7: "⁷ A lion has come out of his lair;\n    a destroyer of nations has set out.\n\
      He has left his place\n    to lay waste your land.\nYour towns will lie in ruins\n\
      \    without inhabitant.\n"
    8: "⁸ So put on sackcloth,\n    lament and wail,\nfor the fierce anger of the\
      \ Lord\n    has not turned away from us. \n"
    9: "⁹ “In that day,” declares the Lord,\n    “the king and the officials will\
      \ lose heart,\nthe priests will be horrified,\n    and the prophets will be\
      \ appalled.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! How completely you have deceived this\
      \ people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the sword is at\
      \ our throats!” \n"
    11: '¹¹ At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind
      from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow
      or cleanse; '
    12: "¹² a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments\
      \ against them.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Look! He advances like the clouds,\n    his chariots come like a whirlwind,\n\
      his horses are swifter than eagles.\n    Woe to us! We are ruined!\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved.\n    How long will\
      \ you harbor wicked thoughts?\n"
    15: "¹⁵ A voice is announcing from Dan,\n    proclaiming disaster from the hills\

    16: "¹⁶ “Tell this to the nations,\n    proclaim concerning Jerusalem:\n‘A besieging\

    17: "¹⁷ They surround her like men guarding a field,\n    because she has rebelled\
      \ against me,’”\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Your own conduct and actions\n    have brought this on you.\nThis is\
      \ your punishment.\n    How bitter it is!\n    How it pierces to the heart!”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Oh, my anguish, my anguish!\n    I writhe in pain.\nOh, the agony of my\
      \ heart!\n    My heart pounds within me,\n    I cannot keep silent.\nFor I have\
      \ heard the sound of the trumpet;\n    I have heard the battle cry.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Disaster follows disaster;\n    the whole land lies in ruins.\nIn an instant\
      \ my tents are destroyed,\n    my shelter in a moment.\n"
    21: "²¹ How long must I see the battle standard\n    and hear the sound of the\
      \ trumpet? \n"
    22: "²² “My people are fools;\n    they do not know me.\nThey are senseless children;\n\
      \    they have no understanding.\nThey are skilled in doing evil;\n    they\
      \ know not how to do good.” \n"
    23: "²³ I looked at the earth,\n    and it was formless and empty;\nand at the\
      \ heavens,\n    and their light was gone.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I looked at the mountains,\n    and they were quaking;\n    all the hills\
      \ were swaying.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I looked, and there were no people;\n    every bird in the sky had flown\
      \ away.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert;\n    all its towns lay in\
      \ ruins\n    before the Lord, before his fierce anger. \n"
    27: "²⁷ This is what the Lord says:\n“The whole land will be ruined,\n    though\
      \ I will not destroy it completely.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Therefore the earth will mourn\n    and the heavens above grow dark,\n\
      because I have spoken and will not relent,\n    I have decided and will not\
      \ turn back.” \n"
    29: "²⁹ At the sound of horsemen and archers\n    every town takes to flight.\n\
      Some go into the thickets;\n    some climb up among the rocks.\nAll the towns\
      \ are deserted;\n    no one lives in them. \n"
    30: "³⁰ What are you doing, you devastated one?\n    Why dress yourself in scarlet\n\
      \    and put on jewels of gold?\nWhy highlight your eyes with makeup?\n    You\
      \ adorn yourself in vain.\nYour lovers despise you;\n    they want to kill you.\
      \ \n"
    31: "³¹ I hear a cry as of a woman in labor,\n    a groan as of one bearing her\
      \ first child—\nthe cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,\n    stretching\
      \ out her hands and saying,\n“Alas! I am fainting;\n    my life is given over\
      \ to murderers.”"
  5:
    1: "¹ “Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem,\n    look around and consider,\n\
      \    search through her squares.\nIf you can find but one person\n    who deals\
      \ honestly and seeks the truth,\n    I will forgive this city.\n"
    2: "² Although they say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’\n    still they are swearing\
      \ falsely.” \n"
    3: "³ Lord, do not your eyes look for truth?\n    You struck them, but they felt\
      \ no pain;\n    you crushed them, but they refused correction.\nThey made their\
      \ faces harder than stone\n    and refused to repent.\n"
    4: "⁴ I thought, “These are only the poor;\n    they are foolish,\nfor they do\
      \ not know the way of the Lord,\n    the requirements of their God.\n"
    5: "⁵ So I will go to the leaders\n    and speak to them;\nsurely they know the\
      \ way of the Lord,\n    the requirements of their God.”\nBut with one accord\
      \ they too had broken off the yoke\n    and torn off the bonds.\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them,\n    a wolf from the\
      \ desert will ravage them,\na leopard will lie in wait near their towns\n  \
      \  to tear to pieces any who venture out,\nfor their rebellion is great\n  \
      \  and their backslidings many. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Why should I forgive you?\n    Your children have forsaken me\n    and\
      \ sworn by gods that are not gods.\nI supplied all their needs,\n    yet they\
      \ committed adultery\n    and thronged to the houses of prostitutes.\n"
    8: "⁸ They are well-fed, lusty stallions,\n    each neighing for another man’s\
      \ wife.\n"
    9: "⁹ Should I not punish them for this?”\n    declares the Lord.\n“Should I not\
      \ avenge myself\n    on such a nation as this? \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Go through her vineyards and ravage them,\n    but do not destroy them\
      \ completely.\nStrip off her branches,\n    for these people do not belong to\
      \ the Lord.\n"

    7: "⁷ I will winnow them with a winnowing fork\n    at the city gates of the land.\n\

    8: "⁸ I will make their widows more numerous\n    than the sand of the sea.\n\
      At midday I will bring a destroyer\n    against the mothers of their young men;\n\
      suddenly I will bring down on them\n    anguish and terror.\n"
    9: "⁹ The mother of seven will grow faint\n    and breathe her last.\nHer sun\
      \ will set while it is still day;\n    she will be disgraced and humiliated.\n\

    10: "¹⁰ Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth,\n    a man with whom the whole\

      \ curses me. \n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord said,\n“Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose;\n    surely\

      \ of distress. \n"
    12: "¹² “Can a man break iron—\n    iron from the north—or bronze? \n"
    13: "¹³ “Your wealth and your treasures\n    I will give as plunder, without charge,\n\

    15: "¹⁵ Lord, you understand;\n    remember me and care for me.\n    Avenge me\
      \ on my persecutors.\nYou are long-suffering—do not take me away;\n    think\
      \ of how I suffer reproach for your sake.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ When your words came, I ate them;\n    they were my joy and my heart’s\
      \ delight,\nfor I bear your name,\n    Lord God Almighty.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I never sat in the company of revelers,\n    never made merry with them;\n\
      I sat alone because your hand was on me\n    and you had filled me with indignation.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Why is my pain unending\n    and my wound grievous and incurable?\nYou\

    20: "²⁰ I will make you a wall to this people,\n    a fortified wall of bronze;\n\

  16:
    1: '¹ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    2: '² “You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.” '
    3: '³ For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born in this

    4: "⁴ “They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but\
      \ will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine,\
      \ and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ For this is what the Lord says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral
      meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing,
      my love and my pity from this people,” declares the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ “Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned,

    8: '⁸ “And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and

    10: '¹⁰ “When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the Lord
      decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin
      have we committed against the Lord our God?’ '
    11: '¹¹ then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares
      the Lord, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook
      me and did not keep my law. '
    12: '¹² But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of
      you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. '
    13: "¹³ So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your\

    17: '¹⁷ My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their
      sin concealed from my eyes. '
    18: "¹⁸ I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they\

  18:
    1: '¹ This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '

    1: '¹ This is what the Lord says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along

    5: '⁵ They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire

      will die of a terrible plague. '
    7: "⁷ After that, declares the Lord, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials\
      \ and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into\
      \ the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want\
      \ to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or\
      \ pity or compassion.’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the Lord says: See, I am setting
      before you the way of life and the way of death. '
    9: '⁹ Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But
      whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will
      live; they will escape with their lives. '
    10: "¹⁰ I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the Lord.\
      \ It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy\
      \ it with fire.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the Lord. '
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says to you, house of David:\n“‘Administer justice\
      \ every morning;\n    rescue from the hand of the oppressor\n    the one who\
      \ has been robbed,\nor my wrath will break out and burn like fire\n    because\
      \ of the evil you have done—\n    burn with no one to quench it.\n"
    13: "¹³ I am against you, Jerusalem,\n    you who live above this valley\n   \
      \ on the rocky plateau, declares the Lord—\nyou who say, “Who can come against\
      \ us?\n    Who can enter our refuge?”\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will punish you as your deeds deserve,\n    declares the Lord.\nI will\
      \ kindle a fire in your forests\n    that will consume everything around you.’”"
  22:
    1: '¹ This is what the Lord says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah
      and proclaim this message there: '
    2: '² ‘Hear the word of the Lord to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David’s
      throne—you, your officials and your people who come through these gates. '
    3: '³ This is what the Lord says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand
      of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the
      foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this
      place. '
    4: '⁴ For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on
      David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots
      and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. '
    5: "⁵ But if you do not obey these commands, declares the Lord, I swear by myself\
      \ that this palace will become a ruin.’” \n"
    6: "⁶ For this is what the Lord says about the palace of the king of Judah:\n\
      “Though you are like Gilead to me,\n    like the summit of Lebanon,\nI will\
      \ surely make you like a wasteland,\n    like towns not inhabited.\n"
    7: "⁷ I will send destroyers against you,\n    each man with his weapons,\nand\
      \ they will cut up your fine cedar beams\n    and throw them into the fire.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another,
      ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?’ '
    9: "⁹ And the answer will be: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the\
      \ Lord their God and have worshiped and served other gods.’” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss;\n    rather, weep bitterly\
      \ for him who is exiled,\nbecause he will never return\n    nor see his native\
      \ land again. \n"
    11: '¹¹ For this is what the Lord says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded
      his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: “He will never return. '
    12: "¹² He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not\
      \ see this land again.” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness,\n    his upper rooms\
      \ by injustice,\nmaking his own people work for nothing,\n    not paying them\
      \ for their labor.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He says, ‘I will build myself a great palace\n    with spacious upper\
      \ rooms.’\nSo he makes large windows in it,\n    panels it with cedar\n    and\
      \ decorates it in red. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Does it make you a king\n    to have more and more cedar?\nDid not your\

      \ went well with him.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He defended the cause of the poor and needy,\n    and so all went well.\n\
      Is that not what it means to know me?”\n    declares the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ “But your eyes and your heart\n    are set only on dishonest gain,\non\
      \ shedding innocent blood\n    and on oppression and extortion.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king\
      \ of Judah:\n“They will not mourn for him:\n    ‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my\
      \ sister!’\nThey will not mourn for him:\n    ‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’\n"
    19: "¹⁹ He will have the burial of a donkey—\n    dragged away and thrown\n  \
      \  outside the gates of Jerusalem.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Go up to Lebanon and cry out,\n    let your voice be heard in Bashan,\n\
      cry out from Abarim,\n    for all your allies are crushed.\n"
    21: "²¹ I warned you when you felt secure,\n    but you said, ‘I will not listen!’\n\
      This has been your way from your youth;\n    you have not obeyed me.\n"
    22: "²² The wind will drive all your shepherds away,\n    and your allies will\
      \ go into exile.\nThen you will be ashamed and disgraced\n    because of all\
      \ your wickedness.\n"
    23: "²³ You who live in ‘Lebanon,’\n    who are nestled in cedar buildings,\n\
      how you will groan when pangs come upon you,\n    pain like that of a woman\
      \ in labor! \n"
    24: '²⁴ “As surely as I live,” declares the Lord, “even if you, Jehoiachin son
      of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still
      pull you off. '
    25: '²⁵ I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those
      you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians. '
    26: '²⁶ I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country,
      where neither of you was born, and there you both will die. '
    27: "²⁷ You will never come back to the land you long to return to.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ Is this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot,\n    an object no one wants?\n\
      Why will he and his children be hurled out,\n    cast into a land they do not\
      \ know?\n"
    29: "²⁹ O land, land, land,\n    hear the word of the Lord!\n"
    30: "³⁰ This is what the Lord says:\n“Record this man as if childless,\n    a\
      \ man who will not prosper in his lifetime,\nfor none of his offspring will\
      \ prosper,\n    none will sit on the throne of David\n    or rule anymore in\

  23:
    1: '¹ “Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my
      pasture!” declares the Lord. '
    2: '² Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds
      who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away
      and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the
      evil you have done,” declares the Lord. '
    3: '³ “I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where
      I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will
      be fruitful and increase in number. '
    4: "⁴ I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer\
      \ be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ “The days are coming,” declares the Lord,\n    “when I will raise up for\

      \ just and right in the land.\n"
    6: "⁶ In his days Judah will be saved\n    and Israel will live in safety.\nThis\
      \ is the name by which he will be called:\n    The Lord Our Righteous Savior.\
      \ \n"
    7: '⁷ “So then, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when people will no
      longer say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out
      of Egypt,’ '
    8: "⁸ but they will say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the descendants\
      \ of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where\
      \ he had banished them.’ Then they will live in their own land.” \n"
    9: "⁹ Concerning the prophets:\nMy heart is broken within me;\n    all my bones\
      \ tremble.\nI am like a drunken man,\n    like a strong man overcome by wine,\n\
      because of the Lord\n    and his holy words.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ The land is full of adulterers;\n    because of the curse the land lies\
      \ parched\n    and the pastures in the wilderness are withered.\nThe prophets\
      \ follow an evil course\n    and use their power unjustly. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Both prophet and priest are godless;\n    even in my temple I find their\
      \ wickedness,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n"
    12: "¹² “Therefore their path will become slippery;\n    they will be banished\
      \ to darkness\n    and there they will fall.\nI will bring disaster on them\n\
      \    in the year they are punished,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Among the prophets of Samaria\n    I saw this repulsive thing:\nThey\
      \ prophesied by Baal\n    and led my people Israel astray.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ And among the prophets of Jerusalem\n    I have seen something horrible:\n\
      \    They commit adultery and live a lie.\nThey strengthen the hands of evildoers,\n\
      \    so that not one of them turns from their wickedness.\nThey are all like\
      \ Sodom to me;\n    the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says concerning the prophets:\n\
      “I will make them eat bitter food\n    and drink poisoned water,\nbecause from\
      \ the prophets of Jerusalem\n    ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is what the Lord Almighty says:\n“Do not listen to what the prophets\
      \ are prophesying to you;\n    they fill you with false hopes.\nThey speak visions\
      \ from their own minds,\n    not from the mouth of the Lord.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ They keep saying to those who despise me,\n    ‘The Lord says: You will\
      \ have peace.’\nAnd to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts\n   \
      \ they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But which of them has stood in the council of the Lord\n    to see or\
      \ to hear his word?\n    Who has listened and heard his word?\n"
    19: "¹⁹ See, the storm of the Lord\n    will burst out in wrath,\na whirlwind\
      \ swirling down\n    on the heads of the wicked.\n"
    20: "²⁰ The anger of the Lord will not turn back\n    until he fully accomplishes\n\
      \    the purposes of his heart.\nIn days to come\n    you will understand it\
      \ clearly.\n"
    21: "²¹ I did not send these prophets,\n    yet they have run with their message;\n\
      I did not speak to them,\n    yet they have prophesied.\n"
    22: "²² But if they had stood in my council,\n    they would have proclaimed my\
      \ words to my people\nand would have turned them from their evil ways\n    and\
      \ from their evil deeds. \n"
    23: "²³ “Am I only a God nearby,”\ndeclares the Lord,\n    “and not a God far\
      \ away?\n"
    24: "²⁴ Who can hide in secret places\n    so that I cannot see them?”\ndeclares\
      \ the Lord.\n    “Do not I fill heaven and earth?”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They
      say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ '
    26: '²⁶ How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who
      prophesy the delusions of their own minds? '
    27: '²⁷ They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget
      my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. '
    28: '²⁸ Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who
      has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares
      the Lord. '
    29: "²⁹ “Is not my word like fire,” declares the Lord, “and like a hammer that\
      \ breaks a rock in pieces? \n"
    30: '³⁰ “Therefore,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who steal from
      one another words supposedly from me. '
    31: '³¹ Yes,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who wag their own
      tongues and yet declare, ‘The Lord declares.’ '
    32: "³² Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the Lord.\
      \ “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I\
      \ did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,”\
      \ declares the Lord. \n"
    33: '³³ “When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message
      from the Lord?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you, declares the
      Lord.’ '
    34: '³⁴ If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from
      the Lord,’ I will punish them and their household. '
    35: '³⁵ This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites:
      ‘What is the Lord’s answer?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    36: '³⁶ But you must not mention ‘a message from the Lord’ again, because each
      one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living
      God, the Lord Almighty, our God. '
    37: '³⁷ This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the Lord’s answer
      to you?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ '
    38: '³⁸ Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ this is what the
      Lord says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ even though
      I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the Lord.’ '
    39: '³⁹ Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along
      with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. '
    40: ⁴⁰ I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not
      be forgotten.”
  24:
    1: '¹ After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the skilled
      workers and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to
      Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Lord showed me two baskets of
      figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord. '
    2: "² One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket\
      \ had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten. \n"
    3: "³ Then the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”\n“Figs,” I answered.\
      \ “The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.”\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the word of the Lord came to me: '
    5: '⁵ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like these good figs,
      I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to
      the land of the Babylonians. '
    6: '⁶ My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back
      to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them
      and not uproot them. '
    7: "⁷ I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord. They will be my\
      \ people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their\
      \ heart. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,’ says the
      Lord, ‘so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors
      from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt. '
    9: '⁹ I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth,
      a reproach and a byword, a curse and an object of ridicule, wherever I banish
      them. '
    10: ¹⁰ I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed
      from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’”
  25:
    1: '¹ The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth
      year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon. '
    2: '² So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those
      living in Jerusalem: '
    3: "³ For twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king\
      \ of Judah until this very day—the word of the Lord has come to me and I have\
      \ spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened. \n"
    4: '⁴ And though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again
      and again, you have not listened or paid any attention. '
    5: '⁵ They said, “Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices,
      and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your ancestors for ever
      and ever. '
    6: "⁶ Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger\
      \ with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.” \n"
    7: "⁷ “But you did not listen to me,” declares the Lord, “and you have aroused\
      \ my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ Therefore the Lord Almighty says this: “Because you have not listened to
      my words, '
    9: '⁹ I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon,” declares the Lord, “and I will bring them against this land
      and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely
      destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting
      ruin. '
    10: '¹⁰ I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of
      bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. '
    11: "¹¹ This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations\
      \ will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. \n"
    12: '¹² “But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon
      and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt,” declares the
      Lord, “and will make it desolate forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all
      that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations. '
    14: "¹⁴ They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will\
      \ repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand

      he sent me drink it: '

      a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse—as they are today; '

      \ the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of\
      \ Sheshak will drink it too. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Then tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says:
      Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I
      will send among you.’ '
    28: '²⁸ But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them,
      ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: You must drink it! '
    29: "²⁹ See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name,\
      \ and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling\
      \ down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the Lord Almighty.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ “Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them:\n“‘The Lord\

      \    shout against all who live on the earth.\n"
    31: "³¹ The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth,\n    for the Lord will\

    33: "³³ At that time those slain by the Lord will be everywhere—from one end of\
      \ the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried,\

    34: "³⁴ Weep and wail, you shepherds;\n    roll in the dust, you leaders of the\

    36: "³⁶ Hear the cry of the shepherds,\n    the wailing of the leaders of the\

      house of the Lord. Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word. '
    3: '³ Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I
      will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the
      evil they have done. '
    4: '⁴ Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: If you do not listen to me and
      follow my law, which I have set before you, '
    5: '⁵ and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom
      I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened), '
    6: "⁶ then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse among all\
      \ the nations of the earth.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these
      words in the house of the Lord. '
    8: '⁸ But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the Lord
      had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized
      him and said, “You must die! '
    9: "⁹ Why do you prophesy in the Lord’s name that this house will be like Shiloh\
      \ and this city will be desolate and deserted?” And all the people crowded around\
      \ Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from
      the royal palace to the house of the Lord and took their places at the entrance
      of the New Gate of the Lord’s house. '
    11: "¹¹ Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people,\
      \ “This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this\
      \ city. You have heard it with your own ears!” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: “The Lord
      sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have
      heard. '
    13: '¹³ Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the Lord your God. Then
      the Lord will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you. '
    14: '¹⁴ As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and
      right. '
    15: "¹⁵ Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt\
      \ of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in\
      \ it, for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your\
      \ hearing.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets,\
      \ “This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name\
      \ of the Lord our God.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire
      assembly of people, '
    18: "¹⁸ “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah.\
      \ He told all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says:\n“‘Zion\
      \ will be plowed like a field,\n    Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,\n\
      \    the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death?\
      \ Did not Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek his favor? And did not the Lord relent,\
      \ so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about\
      \ to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!” \n"
    20: '²⁰ (Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied
      in the name of the Lord; he prophesied the same things against this city and
      this land as Jeremiah did. '
    21: '²¹ When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words,
      the king was determined to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled
      in fear to Egypt. '
    22: '²² King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with
      some other men. '
    23: "²³ They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had\
      \ him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of\
      \ the common people.) \n"
    24: ²⁴ Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not
      handed over to the people to be put to death.
  27:
    1: '¹ Early in the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came
      to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² This is what the Lord said to me: “Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars
      and put it on your neck. '
    3: '³ Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through
      the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. '
    4: '⁴ Give them a message for their masters and say, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty,
      the God of Israel, says: “Tell this to your masters: '
    5: '⁵ With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people
      and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please. '
    6: '⁶ Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him. '
    7: "⁷ All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for\
      \ his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him. \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘“If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king
      of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the
      sword, famine and plague, declares the Lord, until I destroy it by his hand. '
    9: '⁹ So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams,
      your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, ‘You will not serve the king of
      Babylon.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from
      your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. '
    11: "¹¹ But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon\
      \ and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and\
      \ to live there, declares the Lord.”’” \n"
    12: '¹² I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck
      under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will
      live. '
    13: '¹³ Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with
      which the Lord has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? '
    14: '¹⁴ Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not
      serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you. '
    15: "¹⁵ ‘I have not sent them,’ declares the Lord. ‘They are prophesying lies\
      \ in my name. Therefore, I will banish you and you will perish, both you and\
      \ the prophets who prophesy to you.’” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then I said to the priests and all these people, “This is what the Lord
      says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, ‘Very soon now the articles from
      the Lord’s house will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying lies
      to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why
      should this city become a ruin? '
    18: '¹⁸ If they are prophets and have the word of the Lord, let them plead with
      the Lord Almighty that the articles remaining in the house of the Lord and in
      the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon. '
    19: '¹⁹ For this is what the Lord Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze
      Sea, the movable stands and the other articles that are left in this city, '
    20: '²⁰ which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried
      Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon,
      along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— '
    21: '²¹ yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the
      things that are left in the house of the Lord and in the palace of the king
      of Judah and in Jerusalem: '
    22: ²² ‘They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day
      I come for them,’ declares the Lord. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore
      them to this place.’”
  28:
    1: '¹ In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign
      of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon,
      said to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the
      people: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will break
      the yoke of the king of Babylon. '
    3: '³ Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the
      Lord’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took
      to Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of\
      \ Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the\
      \ Lord, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests
      and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ He said, “Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfill the words you have
      prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lord’s house and all the exiles back
      to this place from Babylon. '
    7: '⁷ Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing
      of all the people: '
    8: '⁸ From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war,
      disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. '
    9: "⁹ But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent\
      \ by the Lord only if his prediction comes true.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah
      and broke it, '
    11: "¹¹ and he said before all the people, “This is what the Lord says: ‘In the\
      \ same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck\
      \ of all the nations within two years.’” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went\
      \ on his way. \n"
    12: '¹² After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet
      Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You have broken a
      wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. '
    14: "¹⁴ This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an\
      \ iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar\
      \ king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over\
      \ the wild animals.’” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah!
      The Lord has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. '
    16: "¹⁶ Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I am about to remove you from the\
      \ face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached\
      \ rebellion against the Lord.’” \n"
    17: ¹⁷ In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.
  29:
    1: '¹ This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem
      to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and
      all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to
      Babylon. '
    2: '² (This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials
      and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans
      had gone into exile from Jerusalem.) '
    3: "³ He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of\
      \ Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon.\
      \ It said: \n"
    4: '⁴ This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried
      into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: '
    5: '⁵ “Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. '
    6: '⁶ Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your
      daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase
      in number there; do not decrease. '
    7: '⁷ Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried
      you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will
      prosper.” '
    8: '⁸ Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let
      the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams
      you encourage them to have. '
    9: "⁹ They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares\
      \ the Lord. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ This is what the Lord says: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon,
      I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. '
    11: '¹¹ For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper
      you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. '
    12: '¹² Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to
      you. '
    13: '¹³ You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back from\
      \ captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have\
      \ banished you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back to the place from\
      \ which I carried you into exile.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ You may say, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,” '
    16: '¹⁶ but this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David’s throne
      and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not
      go with you into exile— '
    17: '¹⁷ yes, this is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will send the sword, famine
      and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they
      cannot be eaten. '
    18: '¹⁸ I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them
      abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror,
      of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them. '
    19: "¹⁹ For they have not listened to my words,” declares the Lord, “words that\
      \ I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles\
      \ have not listened either,” declares the Lord. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I have sent
      away from Jerusalem to Babylon. '
    21: '²¹ This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son
      of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in
      my name: “I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
      and he will put them to death before your very eyes. '
    22: '²² Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use
      this curse: ‘May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of
      Babylon burned in the fire.’ '
    23: "²³ For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery\
      \ with their neighbors’ wives, and in my name they have uttered lies—which I\
      \ did not authorize. I know it and am a witness to it,” declares the Lord. \n"
    24: '²⁴ Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, '
    25: '²⁵ “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters
      in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son
      of Maaseiah, and to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah, '
    26: '²⁶ ‘The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge
      of the house of the Lord; you should put any maniac who acts like a prophet
      into the stocks and neck-irons. '
    27: '²⁷ So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a
      prophet among you? '
    28: "²⁸ He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore\
      \ build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.’” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. '
    30: '³⁰ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    31: '³¹ “Send this message to all the exiles: ‘This is what the Lord says about
      Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though
      I did not send him, and has persuaded you to trust in lies, '
    32: '³² this is what the Lord says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite
      and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he
      see the good things I will do for my people, declares the Lord, because he has
      preached rebellion against me.’”'
  30:
    1: '¹ This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the
      words I have spoken to you. '
    3: "³ The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will bring my people Israel\
      \ and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors\
      \ to possess,’ says the Lord.” \n"
    4: '⁴ These are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah: '
    5: "⁵ “This is what the Lord says:\n“‘Cries of fear are heard—\n    terror, not\
      \ peace.\n"
    6: "⁶ Ask and see:\n    Can a man bear children?\nThen why do I see every strong\
      \ man\n    with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor,\n    every face\
      \ turned deathly pale?\n"
    7: "⁷ How awful that day will be!\n    No other will be like it.\nIt will be a\
      \ time of trouble for Jacob,\n    but he will be saved out of it. \n"
    8: "⁸ “‘In that day,’ declares the Lord Almighty,\n    ‘I will break the yoke\
      \ off their necks\nand will tear off their bonds;\n    no longer will foreigners\
      \ enslave them.\n"
    9: "⁹ Instead, they will serve the Lord their God\n    and David their king,\n\
      \    whom I will raise up for them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “‘So do not be afraid, Jacob my servant;\n    do not be dismayed, Israel,’\n\
      declares the Lord.\n‘I will surely save you out of a distant place,\n    your\
      \ descendants from the land of their exile.\nJacob will again have peace and\
      \ security,\n    and no one will make him afraid.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I am with you and will save you,’\n    declares the Lord.\n‘Though I completely\
      \ destroy all the nations\n    among which I scatter you,\n    I will not completely\
      \ destroy you.\nI will discipline you but only in due measure;\n    I will not\

    12: "¹² “This is what the Lord says:\n“‘Your wound is incurable,\n    your injury\

    13: "¹³ There is no one to plead your cause,\n    no remedy for your sore,\n \
      \   no healing for you.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ All your allies have forgotten you;\n    they care nothing for you.\n\
      I have struck you as an enemy would\n    and punished you as would the cruel,\n\
      because your guilt is so great\n    and your sins so many.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Why do you cry out over your wound,\n    your pain that has no cure?\n\
      Because of your great guilt and many sins\n    I have done these things to you.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “‘But all who devour you will be devoured;\n    all your enemies will\
      \ go into exile.\nThose who plunder you will be plundered;\n    all who make\

    17: "¹⁷ But I will restore you to health\n    and heal your wounds,’\ndeclares\

    21: "²¹ Their leader will be one of their own;\n    their ruler will arise from\

    13: "¹³ Then young women will dance and be glad,\n    young men and old as well.\n\
      I will turn their mourning into gladness;\n    I will give them comfort and\
      \ joy instead of sorrow.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I will satisfy the priests with abundance,\n    and my people will be\
      \ filled with my bounty,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is what the Lord says:\n“A voice is heard in Ramah,\n    mourning\
      \ and great weeping,\nRachel weeping for her children\n    and refusing to be\
      \ comforted,\n    because they are no more.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ This is what the Lord says:\n“Restrain your voice from weeping\n    and\

    17: "¹⁷ So there is hope for your descendants,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n    “Your\

    18: "¹⁸ “I have surely heard Ephraim’s moaning:\n    ‘You disciplined me like\

      \ return,\n    because you are the Lord my God.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ After I strayed,\n    I repented;\nafter I came to understand,\n    I\
      \ beat my breast.\nI was ashamed and humiliated\n    because I bore the disgrace\
      \ of my youth.’\n"
    20: "²⁰ Is not Ephraim my dear son,\n    the child in whom I delight?\nThough\
      \ I often speak against him,\n    I still remember him.\nTherefore my heart\
      \ yearns for him;\n    I have great compassion for him,”\ndeclares the Lord.\

    22: "²² How long will you wander,\n    unfaithful Daughter Israel?\nThe Lord will\
      \ create a new thing on earth—\n    the woman will return to the man.” \n"
    23: '²³ This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “When I bring
      them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will
      once again use these words: ‘The Lord bless you, you prosperous city, you sacred
      mountain.’ '
    24: '²⁴ People will live together in Judah and all its towns—farmers and those
      who move about with their flocks. '

    29: "²⁹ “In those days people will no longer say,\n‘The parents have eaten sour\

    34: "³⁴ No longer will they teach their neighbor,\n    or say to one another,\

    35: "³⁵ This is what the Lord says,\nhe who appoints the sun\n    to shine by\

  32:
    1: '¹ This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of
      Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. '
    2: "² The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah\
      \ the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace\
      \ of Judah. \n"
    3: '³ Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do you
      prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to give
      this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. '
    4: '⁴ Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians but will certainly
      be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face
      to face and see him with his own eyes. '
    5: "⁵ He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with\
      \ him, declares the Lord. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not\
      \ succeed.’” \n"
    6: '⁶ Jeremiah said, “The word of the Lord came to me: '
    7: "⁷ Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy\
      \ my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty\
      \ to buy it.’ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Then, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard\
      \ of the guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.\
      \ Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.’\n\
      “I knew that this was the word of the Lord; "
    9: '⁹ so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out
      for him seventeen shekels of silver. '
    10: '¹⁰ I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver
      on the scales. '
    11: '¹¹ I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions,
      as well as the unsealed copy— '
    12: "¹² and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in\
      \ the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the\
      \ deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. \n"
    13: '¹³ “In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents,
      both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in
      a clay jar so they will last a long time. '
    15: "¹⁵ For this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields\
      \ and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed\
      \ to the Lord: \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Ah, Sovereign Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great
      power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you. '
    18: '¹⁸ You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents’ sins
      into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name
      is the Lord Almighty, '
    19: '¹⁹ great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open
      to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct
      and as their deeds deserve. '
    20: '²⁰ You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this
      day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still
      yours. '
    21: '²¹ You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by
      a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror. '
    22: '²² You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land
      flowing with milk and honey. '
    23: "²³ They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow\
      \ your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all\
      \ this disaster on them. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the
      sword, famine and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians
      who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see. '
    25: "²⁵ And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you,\
      \ Sovereign Lord, say to me, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the transaction\
      \ witnessed.’” \n"
    26: '²⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    27: '²⁷ “I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me? '
    28: '²⁸ Therefore this is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into
      the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will
      capture it. '
    29: "²⁹ The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on\
      \ fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused\
      \ my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink\
      \ offerings to other gods. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight
      from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse
      my anger with what their hands have made, declares the Lord. '
    31: '³¹ From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger
      and wrath that I must remove it from my sight. '
    32: '³² The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have
      done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people
      of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. '
    33: '³³ They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them
      again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline. '
    34: '³⁴ They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled
      it. '
    35: "³⁵ They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice\
      \ their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter\
      \ my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.\
      \ \n"
    36: '³⁶ “You are saying about this city, ‘By the sword, famine and plague it will
      be given into the hands of the king of Babylon’; but this is what the Lord,
      the God of Israel, says: '
    37: '³⁷ I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my
      furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let
      them live in safety. '
    38: '³⁸ They will be my people, and I will be their God. '
    39: '³⁹ I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always
      fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after
      them. '
    40: '⁴⁰ I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing
      good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn
      away from me. '
    41: "⁴¹ I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this\
      \ land with all my heart and soul. \n"
    42: '⁴² “This is what the Lord says: As I have brought all this great calamity
      on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them. '
    43: '⁴³ Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is
      a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the
      hands of the Babylonians.’ '
    44: ⁴⁴ Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and
      witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in
      the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills
      and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the Lord.”
  33:
    1: '¹ While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word
      of the Lord came to him a second time: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says, he who made the earth, the Lord who formed
      it and established it—the Lord is his name: '
    3: '³ ‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things
      you do not know.’ '
    4: '⁴ For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this
      city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against
      the siege ramps and the sword '
    5: "⁵ in the fight with the Babylonians: ‘They will be filled with the dead bodies\
      \ of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from\
      \ this city because of all its wickedness. \n"
    6: '⁶ “‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people
      and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. '
    7: '⁷ I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and will rebuild them
      as they were before. '
    8: '⁸ I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and
      will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. '
    9: "⁹ Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations\
      \ on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in\
      \ awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “This is what the Lord says: ‘You say about this place, “It is a desolate
      waste, without people or animals.” Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets
      of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there
      will be heard once more '
    11: "¹¹ the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and\
      \ the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord, saying,\n\
      “Give thanks to the Lord Almighty,\n    for the Lord is good;\n    his love\
      \ endures forever.”\nFor I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were\
      \ before,’ says the Lord. \n"
    12: '¹² “This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In this place, desolate and without
      people or animals—in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds
      to rest their flocks. '
    13: "¹³ In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the\
      \ Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and\
      \ in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who\
      \ counts them,’ says the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “‘The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will fulfill the good\
      \ promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “‘In those days and at that time\n    I will make a righteous Branch sprout\
      \ from David’s line;\n    he will do what is just and right in the land.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ In those days Judah will be saved\n    and Jerusalem will live in safety.\n\
      This is the name by which it will be called:\n    The Lord Our Righteous Savior.’\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ For this is what the Lord says: ‘David will never fail to have a man to
      sit on the throne of Israel, '
    18: "¹⁸ nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before\
      \ me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to present\
      \ sacrifices.’” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    20: '²⁰ “This is what the Lord says: ‘If you can break my covenant with the day
      and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their
      appointed time, '
    21: '²¹ then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites
      who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer
      have a descendant to reign on his throne. '
    22: "²² I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister\
      \ before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand\
      \ on the seashore.’” \n"
    23: '²³ The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    24: '²⁴ “Have you not noticed that these people are saying, ‘The Lord has rejected
      the two kingdoms he chose’? So they despise my people and no longer regard them
      as a nation. '
    25: '²⁵ This is what the Lord says: ‘If I have not made my covenant with day and
      night and established the laws of heaven and earth, '
    26: ²⁶ then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will
      not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and
      Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.’”
  34:
    1: '¹ While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms
      and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its
      surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of
      Judah and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city
      into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. '
    3: "³ You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and given\
      \ into his hands. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he\
      \ will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon. \n"
    4: '⁴ “‘Yet hear the Lord’s promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what
      the Lord says concerning you: You will not die by the sword; '
    5: "⁵ you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your\
      \ predecessors, the kings who ruled before you, so they will make a fire in\
      \ your honor and lament, “Alas, master!” I myself make this promise, declares\
      \ the Lord.’” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, '
    7: "⁷ while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and\
      \ the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah.\
      \ These were the only fortified cities left in Judah. \n"
    8: '⁸ The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant
      with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. '
    9: '⁹ Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was
      to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. '
    10: '¹⁰ So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed
      that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in
      bondage. They agreed, and set them free. '
    11: "¹¹ But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had\
      \ freed and enslaved them again. \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    13: '¹³ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with
      your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
      I said, '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have
      sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them
      go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to
      me. '
    15: '¹⁵ Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed
      freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house
      that bears my Name. '
    16: "¹⁶ But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken\
      \ back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished.\
      \ You have forced them to become your slaves again. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “Therefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have
      not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you,
      declares the Lord—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will
      make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth. '
    18: '¹⁸ Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of
      the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two
      and then walked between its pieces. '
    19: '¹⁹ The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and
      all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf, '
    20: "²⁰ I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them.\
      \ Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals. \n"
    21: '²¹ “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands
      of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon,
      which has withdrawn from you. '
    22: ²² I am going to give the order, declares the Lord, and I will bring them
      back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And
      I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”
  35:
    1: '¹ This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of
      Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: '
    2: "² “Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms\
      \ of the house of the Lord and give them wine to drink.” \n"
    3: '³ So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and
      his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites. '
    4: '⁴ I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the room of the sons of
      Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials,
      which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper. '
    5: "⁵ Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said\
      \ to them, “Drink some wine.” \n"
    6: '⁶ But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab
      son of Rekab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your descendants must ever
      drink wine. '
    7: '⁷ Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must
      never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will
      live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’ '
    8: '⁸ We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded
      us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine '
    9: '⁹ or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops. '
    10: '¹⁰ We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather
      Jehonadab commanded us. '
    11: "¹¹ But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come,\
      \ we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.’ So we\
      \ have remained in Jerusalem.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying: '
    13: '¹³ “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell
      the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson
      and obey my words?’ declares the Lord. '
    14: '¹⁴ ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and
      this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they
      obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet
      you have not obeyed me. '
    15: '¹⁵ Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said,
      “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not
      follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given
      to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me. '
    16: "¹⁶ The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command\
      \ their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says:\
      \ ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem\
      \ every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not\
      \ listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the Lord
      Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the command of your forefather
      Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he
      ordered.’ '
    19: '¹⁹ Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab
      son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.’”'
  36:
    1: '¹ In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came
      to Jeremiah from the Lord: '
    2: '² “Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning
      Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you
      in the reign of Josiah till now. '
    3: "³ Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict\
      \ on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their\
      \ wickedness and their sin.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all
      the words the Lord had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. '
    5: '⁵ Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the
      Lord’s temple. '
    6: '⁶ So you go to the house of the Lord on a day of fasting and read to the people
      from the scroll the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read them
      to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. '
    7: "⁷ Perhaps they will bring their petition before the Lord and will each turn\
      \ from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people\
      \ by the Lord are great.” \n"
    8: '⁸ Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do;
      at the Lord’s temple he read the words of the Lord from the scroll. '
    9: '⁹ In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of
      Judah, a time of fasting before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in
      Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. '
    10: "¹⁰ From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the\
      \ upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read\
      \ to all the people at the Lord’s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words
      of the Lord from the scroll, '
    12: '¹² he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the
      officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan
      son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the
      other officials. '
    13: '¹³ After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people
      from the scroll, '
    14: '¹⁴ all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah,
      the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read
      to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll
      in his hand. '
    15: "¹⁵ They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.”\nSo Baruch read\
      \ it to them. "
    16: '¹⁶ When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and
      said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” '
    17: "¹⁷ Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this?\
      \ Did Jeremiah dictate it?” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote\
      \ them in ink on the scroll.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t\
      \ let anyone know where you are.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they
      went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. '
    21: '²¹ The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the
      room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials
      standing beside him. '
    22: '²² It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment,
      with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. '
    23: '²³ Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king
      cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the
      entire scroll was burned in the fire. '
    24: '²⁴ The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear,
      nor did they tear their clothes. '
    25: '²⁵ Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn
      the scroll, he would not listen to them. '
    26: "²⁶ Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son\
      \ of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah\
      \ the prophet. But the Lord had hidden them. \n"
    27: '²⁷ After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had
      written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    28: '²⁸ “Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first
      scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. '
    29: '²⁹ Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned
      that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would
      certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?” '
    30: '³⁰ Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He
      will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out
      and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. '
    31: "³¹ I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness;\
      \ I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah\
      \ every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’”\
      \ \n"
    32: ³² So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of
      Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll
      that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words
      were added to them.
  37:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of
      Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim. '
    2: "² Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention\
      \ to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet. \n"
    3: "³ King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah\
      \ son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to\
      \ the Lord our God for us.” \n"
    4: '⁴ Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet
      been put in prison. '
    5: "⁵ Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians who were\
      \ besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet: '
    7: '⁷ “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah,
      who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support
      you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. '
    8: "⁸ Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture\
      \ it and burn it down.’ \n"
    9: '⁹ “This is what the Lord says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians
      will surely leave us.’ They will not! '
    10: "¹⁰ Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking\
      \ you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and\
      \ burn this city down.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s
      army, '
    12: '¹² Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin
      to get his share of the property among the people there. '
    13: "¹³ But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose\
      \ name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said,\
      \ “You are deserting to the Babylonians!” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.”
      But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought
      him to the officials. '
    15: "¹⁵ They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the\
      \ house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a
      long time. '
    17: "¹⁷ Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where\
      \ he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the Lord?”\n“Yes,” Jeremiah\
      \ replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against
      you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? '
    19: '¹⁹ Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will
      not attack you or this land’? '
    20: "²⁰ But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before\
      \ you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will\
      \ die there.” \n"
    21: ²¹ King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard
      of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day
      until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard
      of the guard.
  38:
    1: '¹ Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal son of Shelemiah,
      and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when
      he said, '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the
      sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live.
      They will escape with their lives; they will live.’ '
    3: "³ And this is what the Lord says: ‘This city will certainly be given into\
      \ the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’” \n"
    4: "⁴ Then the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. He\
      \ is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the\
      \ people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good\
      \ of these people but their ruin.” \n"
    5: "⁵ “He is in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “The king can do nothing\
      \ to oppose you.” \n"
    6: "⁶ So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s\
      \ son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes\
      \ into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down\
      \ into the mud. \n"
    7: '⁷ But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they
      had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin
      Gate, '
    8: '⁸ Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him, '
    9: "⁹ “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to\
      \ Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve\
      \ to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from\
      \ here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury
      in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let
      them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. '
    12: '¹² Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out
      clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so, '
    13: "¹³ and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern.\
      \ And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to\
      \ the third entrance to the temple of the Lord. “I am going to ask you something,”\
      \ the king said to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, will you not kill\
      \ me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as\
      \ the Lord lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand\
      \ you over to those who want to kill you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord God Almighty, the
      God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon,
      your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your
      family will live. '
    18: "¹⁸ But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon,\
      \ this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn\
      \ it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone\
      \ over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and\
      \ they will mistreat me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ “They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the Lord by doing
      what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared. '
    21: '²¹ But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has revealed to
      me: '
    22: "²² All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought\
      \ out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you:\n\
      “‘They misled you and overcame you—\n    those trusted friends of yours.\nYour\
      \ feet are sunk in the mud;\n    your friends have deserted you.’ \n"
    23: "²³ “All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You\
      \ yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king\
      \ of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation,
      or you may die. '
    25: '²⁵ If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and
      say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not
      hide it from us or we will kill you,’ '
    26: "²⁶ then tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s\
      \ house to die there.’” \n"
    27: "²⁷ All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them\
      \ everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for\
      \ no one had heard his conversation with the king. \n"
    28: "²⁸ And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem\
      \ was captured.\nThis is how Jerusalem was taken:"
  39:
    1: '¹ In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege
      to it. '
    2: '² And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the
      city wall was broken through. '
    3: '³ Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the
      Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer
      a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon. '
    4: "⁴ When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they\
      \ left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between\
      \ the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah. \n"
    5: '⁵ But the Babylonian army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains
      of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
      at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. '
    6: '⁶ There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before
      his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah. '
    7: "⁷ Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take\
      \ him to Babylon. \n"
    8: '⁸ The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people
      and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. '
    9: '⁹ Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon
      the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him,
      and the rest of the people. '
    10: "¹⁰ But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of\
      \ Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave\
      \ them vineyards and fields. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah
      through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard: '
    12: '¹² “Take him and look after him; don’t harm him but do for him whatever he
      asks.” '
    13: '¹³ So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer,
      Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon '
    14: "¹⁴ sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned\
      \ him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to\
      \ his home. So he remained among his own people. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word
      of the Lord came to him: '
    16: '¹⁶ “Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty,
      the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city—words
      concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before
      your eyes. '
    17: '¹⁷ But I will rescue you on that day, declares the Lord; you will not be
      given into the hands of those you fear. '
    18: ¹⁸ I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your
      life, because you trust in me, declares the Lord.’”
  40:
    1: '¹ The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan commander of the
      imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains
      among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into
      exile to Babylon. '
    2: '² When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, “The Lord
      your God decreed this disaster for this place. '
    3: '³ And now the Lord has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would.
      All this happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not obey
      him. '
    4: '⁴ But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me
      to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to,
      then don’t come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.” '
    5: "⁵ However, before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah\
      \ son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed\
      \ over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere\
      \ else you please.”\nThen the commander gave him provisions and a present and\
      \ let him go. "
    6: "⁶ So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him\
      \ among the people who were left behind in the land. \n"
    7: '⁷ When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country
      heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor
      over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were
      the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon, '
    8: '⁸ they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan
      the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite,
      and Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men. '
    9: '⁹ Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them
      and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians,” he said. “Settle
      down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. '
    10: "¹⁰ I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who\
      \ come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and\
      \ put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard
      that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah
      son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them, '
    12: "¹² they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all\
      \ the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance\
      \ of wine and summer fruit. \n"
    13: '¹³ Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country
      came to Gedaliah at Mizpah '
    14: "¹⁴ and said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has\
      \ sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam\
      \ did not believe them. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let\
      \ me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should\
      \ he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be\
      \ scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?” \n"
    16: ¹⁶ But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do such
      a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”
  41:
    1: '¹ In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who
      was of royal blood and had been one of the king’s officers, came with ten men
      to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there, '
    2: '² Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck
      down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the
      one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. '
    3: "³ Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah,\
      \ as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there. \n"
    4: '⁴ The day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew about it, '
    5: '⁵ eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves
      came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense
      with them to the house of the Lord. '
    6: '⁶ Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he
      went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” '
    7: '⁷ When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were
      with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. '
    8: '⁸ But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley,
      olive oil and honey, hidden in a field.” So he let them alone and did not kill
      them with the others. '
    9: "⁹ Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along\
      \ with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against\
      \ Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the\
      \ king’s daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom\
      \ Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of\
      \ Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over\
      \ to the Ammonites. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him
      heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, '
    12: '¹² they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They
      caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon. '
    13: '¹³ When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and
      the army officers who were with him, they were glad. '
    14: '¹⁴ All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over
      to Johanan son of Kareah. '
    15: "¹⁵ But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan\
      \ and fled to the Ammonites. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him
      led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered
      from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of
      Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from
      Gibeon. '
    17: '¹⁷ And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way
      to Egypt '
    18: ¹⁸ to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son
      of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had
      appointed as governor over the land.
  42:
    1: '¹ Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah
      son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached '
    2: '² Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, “Please hear our petition and pray
      to the Lord your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we
      were once many, now only a few are left. '
    3: "³ Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we\
      \ should do.” \n"
    4: "⁴ “I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray\
      \ to the Lord your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the\
      \ Lord says and will keep nothing back from you.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness
      against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the Lord your God
      sends you to tell us. '
    6: "⁶ Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the Lord our God, to\
      \ whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey\
      \ the Lord our God.” \n"
    7: '⁷ Ten days later the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. '
    8: '⁸ So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who
      were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. '
    9: '⁹ He said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you
      sent me to present your petition, says: '
    10: '¹⁰ ‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down;
      I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster
      I have inflicted on you. '
    11: '¹¹ Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be
      afraid of him, declares the Lord, for I am with you and will save you and deliver
      you from his hands. '
    12: "¹² I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and\
      \ restore you to your land.’ \n"
    13: '¹³ “However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey
      the Lord your God, '
    14: '¹⁴ and if you say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see
      war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,’ '
    15: '¹⁵ then hear the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah. This is what the
      Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt
      and you do go to settle there, '
    16: '¹⁶ then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread
      will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. '
    17: '¹⁷ Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die
      by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the
      disaster I will bring on them.’ '
    18: "¹⁸ This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger\
      \ and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my\
      \ wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse and an\
      \ object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach; you will never see this\
      \ place again.’ \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Remnant of Judah, the Lord has told you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be sure
      of this: I warn you today '
    20: '²⁰ that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the Lord your God and
      said, ‘Pray to the Lord our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will
      do it.’ '
    21: '²¹ I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the Lord your God
      in all he sent me to tell you. '
    22: '²² So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague
      in the place where you want to go to settle.”'
  43:
    1: '¹ When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the Lord
      their God—everything the Lord had sent him to tell them— '
    2: '² Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men
      said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to say,
      ‘You must not go to Egypt to settle there.’ '
    3: "³ But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the\
      \ Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.” \n"
    4: '⁴ So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed
      the Lord’s command to stay in the land of Judah. '
    5: '⁵ Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the
      remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the
      nations where they had been scattered. '
    6: '⁶ They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial
      guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan—the men, the
      women, the children and the king’s daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet
      and Baruch son of Neriah along with them. '
    7: "⁷ So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ In Tahpanhes the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: '
    9: '⁹ “While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them
      in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes. '
    10: '¹⁰ Then say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel,
      says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will
      set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal
      canopy above them. '
    11: '¹¹ He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death,
      captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for
      the sword. '
    12: '¹² He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their
      temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of
      lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart. '
    13: ¹³ There in the temple of the sun in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars
      and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’”
  44:
    1: '¹ This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in
      Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great
      disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie
      deserted and in ruins '
    3: '³ because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense
      to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever
      knew. '
    4: '⁴ Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this
      detestable thing that I hate!’ '
    5: '⁵ But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness
      or stop burning incense to other gods. '
    6: "⁶ Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of\
      \ Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are\
      \ today. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Now this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring
      such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women,
      the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? '
    8: '⁸ Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other
      gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and
      make yourselves a curse and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth. '
    9: '⁹ Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the
      kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives
      in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? '
    10: "¹⁰ To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have\
      \ they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I
      am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. '
    12: '¹² I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt
      to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword
      or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or
      famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object
      of reproach. '
    13: '¹³ I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague,
      as I punished Jerusalem. '
    14: "¹⁴ None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape\
      \ or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and\
      \ live; none will return except a few fugitives.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other
      gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the
      people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, '
    16: '¹⁶ “We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of
      the Lord! '
    17: '¹⁷ We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense
      to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and
      our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in
      the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off
      and suffered no harm. '
    18: "¹⁸ But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring\
      \ out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by\
      \ sword and famine.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured\
      \ out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making\
      \ cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering
      him, '
    21: '²¹ “Did not the Lord remember and call to mind the incense burned in the
      towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your
      kings and your officials and the people of the land? '
    22: '²² When the Lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable
      things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants,
      as it is today. '
    23: "²³ Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the Lord and have\
      \ not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this\
      \ disaster has come upon you, as you now see.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word
      of the Lord, all you people of Judah in Egypt. '
    25: "²⁵ This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your\
      \ wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, ‘We will certainly\
      \ carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to\
      \ the Queen of Heaven.’\n“Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! "
    26: '²⁶ But hear the word of the Lord, all you Jews living in Egypt: ‘I swear
      by my great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that no one from Judah living anywhere in
      Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, “As surely as the Sovereign Lord
      lives.” '
    27: '²⁷ For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt
      will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. '
    28: "²⁸ Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt\
      \ will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt\
      \ will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs. \n"
    29: '²⁹ “‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’
      declares the Lord, ‘so that you will know that my threats of harm against you
      will surely stand.’ '
    30: '³⁰ This is what the Lord says: ‘I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king
      of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave
      Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the
      enemy who wanted to kill him.’”'
  45:
    1: '¹ When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet
      dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah
      said this to Baruch: '
    2: '² “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: '
    3: '³ You said, ‘Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out
      with groaning and find no rest.’ '
    4: '⁴ But the Lord has told me to say to you, ‘This is what the Lord says: I will
      overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth. '
    5: ⁵ Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will
      bring disaster on all people, declares the Lord, but wherever you go I will
      let you escape with your life.’”
  46:
    1: "¹ This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning\
      \ the nations: \n"
    2: "² Concerning Egypt:\nThis is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho\
      \ king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by\

    6: "⁶ “The swift cannot flee\n    nor the strong escape.\nIn the north by the\

    59: '⁵⁹ This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah
      son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king
      of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. '
    60: '⁶⁰ Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come
      upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. '
    61: '⁶¹ He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these
      words aloud. '
    62: '⁶² Then say, ‘Lord, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither
      people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.’ '
    63: '⁶³ When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into
      the Euphrates. '
    64: "⁶⁴ Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster\
      \ I will bring on her. And her people will fall.’”\nThe words of Jeremiah end\
      \ here."
  52:
    1: '¹ Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in
      Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah;
      she was from Libnah. '
    2: '² He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done. '
    3: "³ It was because of the Lord’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and\
      \ Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence.\nNow Zedekiah rebelled\
      \ against the king of Babylon. \n"
    4: '⁴ So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth
      month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole
      army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. '
    5: "⁵ The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so
      severe that there was no food for the people to eat. '
    7: '⁷ Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left
      the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden,
      though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah, '
    8: '⁸ but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains
      of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered, '
    9: "⁹ and he was captured.\nHe was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the\
      \ land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. "
    10: '¹⁰ There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before
      his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. '
    11: "¹¹ Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took\
      \ him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death. \n"
    12: '¹² On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar
      king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the
      king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ He set fire to the temple of the Lord, the royal palace and all the houses
      of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down. '
    14: '¹⁴ The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard,
      broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. '
    15: '¹⁵ Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the
      poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the
      craftsmen and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon. '
    16: "¹⁶ But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land\
      \ to work the vineyards and fields. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the
      bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord and they carried all the bronze
      to Babylon. '
    18: '¹⁸ They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls,
      dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. '
    19: "¹⁹ The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling\
      \ bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that\
      \ were made of pure gold or silver. \n"
    20: '²⁰ The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under
      it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the
      Lord, was more than could be weighed. '
    21: '²¹ Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference;
      each was four fingers thick, and hollow. '
    22: '²² The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated
      with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with
      its pomegranates, was similar. '
    23: "²³ There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates\
      \ above the surrounding network was a hundred. \n"
    24: '²⁴ The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest,
      Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers. '
    25: '²⁵ Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting
      men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer
      in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in
      the city. '
    26: '²⁶ Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of
      Babylon at Riblah. '
    27: "²⁷ There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed.\n\
      So Judah went into captivity, away from her land. "
    28: "²⁸ This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile:\n\
      in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews; \n"
    29: "²⁹ in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year,\n832 people from Jerusalem; \n"
    30: "³⁰ in his twenty-third year,\n745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the\
      \ commander of the imperial guard.\nThere were 4,600 people in all. \n"
    31: '³¹ In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in
      the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the
      twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison. '
    32: '³² He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those
      of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. '
    33: '³³ So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life
      ate regularly at the king’s table. '
    34: ³⁴ Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long
      as he lived, till the day of his death.
