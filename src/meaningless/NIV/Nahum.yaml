      \ \n"
    2: "² The Lord is a jealous and avenging God;\n    the Lord takes vengeance and\
      \ is filled with wrath.\nThe Lord takes vengeance on his foes\n    and vents\
      \ his wrath against his enemies.\n"
    3: "³ The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;\n    the Lord will not leave\
      \ the guilty unpunished.\nHis way is in the whirlwind and the storm,\n    and\
      \ clouds are the dust of his feet.\n"
    4: "⁴ He rebukes the sea and dries it up;\n    he makes all the rivers run dry.\n\
      Bashan and Carmel wither\n    and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.\n"
    5: "⁵ The mountains quake before him\n    and the hills melt away.\nThe earth\
      \ trembles at his presence,\n    the world and all who live in it.\n"
    6: "⁶ Who can withstand his indignation?\n    Who can endure his fierce anger?\n\
      His wrath is poured out like fire;\n    the rocks are shattered before him.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord is good,\n    a refuge in times of trouble.\nHe cares for those\
      \ who trust in him,\n"
    8: "⁸     but with an overwhelming flood\nhe will make an end of Nineveh;\n  \
      \  he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness. \n"
    9: "⁹ Whatever they plot against the Lord\n    he will bring to an end;\n    trouble\
      \ will not come a second time.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ They will be entangled among thorns\n    and drunk from their wine;\n\
      \    they will be consumed like dry stubble.\n"
    11: "¹¹ From you, Nineveh, has one come forth\n    who plots evil against the\
      \ Lord\n    and devises wicked plans. \n"
    12: "¹² This is what the Lord says:\n“Although they have allies and are numerous,\n\
      \    they will be destroyed and pass away.\nAlthough I have afflicted you, Judah,\n\
      \    I will afflict you no more.\n"
    13: "¹³ Now I will break their yoke from your neck\n    and tear your shackles\
      \ away.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord has given a command concerning you, Nineveh:\n    “You will have\
      \ no descendants to bear your name.\nI will destroy the images and idols\n \
      \   that are in the temple of your gods.\nI will prepare your grave,\n    for\
      \ you are vile.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Look, there on the mountains,\n    the feet of one who brings good news,\n\
      \    who proclaims peace!\nCelebrate your festivals, Judah,\n    and fulfill\
      \ your vows.\nNo more will the wicked invade you;\n    they will be completely\
      \ destroyed."
  2:
    1: "An attacker advances against you, Nineveh.\n    Guard the fortress,\n    watch\
      \ the road,\n    brace yourselves,\n    marshal all your strength! \n"
    2: "² The Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob\n    like the splendor of Israel,\n\
      though destroyers have laid them waste\n    and have ruined their vines. \n"
    3: "³ The shields of the soldiers are red;\n    the warriors are clad in scarlet.\n\
      The metal on the chariots flashes\n    on the day they are made ready;\n   \
      \ the spears of juniper are brandished.\n"
    4: "⁴ The chariots storm through the streets,\n    rushing back and forth through\
      \ the squares.\nThey look like flaming torches;\n    they dart about like lightning.\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Nineveh summons her picked troops,\n    yet they stumble on their way.\n\
      They dash to the city wall;\n    the protective shield is put in place.\n"
    6: "⁶ The river gates are thrown open\n    and the palace collapses.\n"
    7: "⁷ It is decreed that Nineveh\n    be exiled and carried away.\nHer female\
      \ slaves moan like doves\n    and beat on their breasts.\n"
    8: "⁸ Nineveh is like a pool\n    whose water is draining away.\n“Stop! Stop!”\
      \ they cry,\n    but no one turns back.\n"
    9: "⁹ Plunder the silver!\n    Plunder the gold!\nThe supply is endless,\n   \
      \ the wealth from all its treasures!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ She is pillaged, plundered, stripped!\n    Hearts melt, knees give way,\n\
      \    bodies tremble, every face grows pale. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Where now is the lions’ den,\n    the place where they fed their young,\n\
      where the lion and lioness went,\n    and the cubs, with nothing to fear?\n"
    12: "¹² The lion killed enough for his cubs\n    and strangled the prey for his\
      \ mate,\nfilling his lairs with the kill\n    and his dens with the prey. \n"
    13: "¹³ “I am against you,”\n    declares the Lord Almighty.\n“I will burn up\
      \ your chariots in smoke,\n    and the sword will devour your young lions.\n\
      \    I will leave you no prey on the earth.\nThe voices of your messengers\n\
      \    will no longer be heard.”"
  3:
    1: "Woe to the city of blood,\n    full of lies,\nfull of plunder,\n    never\
      \ without victims!\n"
    2: "² The crack of whips,\n    the clatter of wheels,\ngalloping horses\n    and\
      \ jolting chariots!\n"
    3: "³ Charging cavalry,\n    flashing swords\n    and glittering spears!\nMany\
      \ casualties,\n    piles of dead,\nbodies without number,\n    people stumbling\
      \ over the corpses—\n"
    4: "⁴ all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute,\n    alluring, the mistress\
      \ of sorceries,\nwho enslaved nations by her prostitution\n    and peoples by\
      \ her witchcraft. \n"
    5: "⁵ “I am against you,” declares the Lord Almighty.\n    “I will lift your skirts\
      \ over your face.\nI will show the nations your nakedness\n    and the kingdoms\
      \ your shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will pelt you with filth,\n    I will treat you with contempt\n    and\
      \ make you a spectacle.\n"
    7: "⁷ All who see you will flee from you and say,\n    ‘Nineveh is in ruins—who\
      \ will mourn for her?’\n    Where can I find anyone to comfort you?” \n"
    8: "⁸ Are you better than Thebes,\n    situated on the Nile,\n    with water around\
      \ her?\nThe river was her defense,\n    the waters her wall.\n"
    9: "⁹ Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength;\n    Put and Libya were among\
      \ her allies.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Yet she was taken captive\n    and went into exile.\nHer infants were\
      \ dashed to pieces\n    at every street corner.\nLots were cast for her nobles,\n\
      \    and all her great men were put in chains.\n"
    11: "¹¹ You too will become drunk;\n    you will go into hiding\n    and seek\
      \ refuge from the enemy. \n"
    12: "¹² All your fortresses are like fig trees\n    with their first ripe fruit;\n\
      when they are shaken,\n    the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.\n"
    13: "¹³ Look at your troops—\n    they are all weaklings.\nThe gates of your land\n\
      \    are wide open to your enemies;\n    fire has consumed the bars of your\
      \ gates. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Draw water for the siege,\n    strengthen your defenses!\nWork the clay,\n\
      \    tread the mortar,\n    repair the brickwork!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ There the fire will consume you;\n    the sword will cut you down—\n \
      \   they will devour you like a swarm of locusts.\nMultiply like grasshoppers,\n\
      \    multiply like locusts!\n"
    16: "¹⁶ You have increased the number of your merchants\n    till they are more\
      \ numerous than the stars in the sky,\nbut like locusts they strip the land\n\
      \    and then fly away.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Your guards are like locusts,\n    your officials like swarms of locusts\n\
      \    that settle in the walls on a cold day—\nbut when the sun appears they\
      \ fly away,\n    and no one knows where. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber;\n    your nobles lie down to\
      \ rest.\nYour people are scattered on the mountains\n    with no one to gather\
      \ them.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ Nothing can heal you;\n    your wound is fatal.\nAll who hear the news\
      \ about you\n    clap their hands at your fall,\nfor who has not felt\n    your\
      \ endless cruelty?"
