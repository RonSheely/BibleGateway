Lamentations:
  1:
    1: "How deserted lies the city,\n    once so full of people!\nHow like a widow\
      \ is she,\n    who once was great among the nations!\nShe who was queen among\
      \ the provinces\n    has now become a slave. \n"
    2: "² Bitterly she weeps at night,\n    tears are on her cheeks.\nAmong all her\
      \ lovers\n    there is no one to comfort her.\nAll her friends have betrayed\
      \ her;\n    they have become her enemies. \n"
    3: "³ After affliction and harsh labor,\n    Judah has gone into exile.\nShe dwells\
      \ among the nations;\n    she finds no resting place.\nAll who pursue her have\
      \ overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress. \n"
    4: "⁴ The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for no one comes to her appointed festivals.\n\
      All her gateways are desolate,\n    her priests groan,\nher young women grieve,\n\
      \    and she is in bitter anguish. \n"
    5: "⁵ Her foes have become her masters;\n    her enemies are at ease.\nThe Lord\
      \ has brought her grief\n    because of her many sins.\nHer children have gone\
      \ into exile,\n    captive before the foe. \n"
    6: "⁶ All the splendor has departed\n    from Daughter Zion.\nHer princes are\
      \ like deer\n    that find no pasture;\nin weakness they have fled\n    before\
      \ the pursuer. \n"
    7: "⁷ In the days of her affliction and wandering\n    Jerusalem remembers all\
      \ the treasures\n    that were hers in days of old.\nWhen her people fell into\
      \ enemy hands,\n    there was no one to help her.\nHer enemies looked at her\n\
      \    and laughed at her destruction. \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem has sinned greatly\n    and so has become unclean.\nAll who honored\
      \ her despise her,\n    for they have all seen her naked;\nshe herself groans\n\
      \    and turns away. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her filthiness clung to her skirts;\n    she did not consider her future.\n\
      Her fall was astounding;\n    there was none to comfort her.\n“Look, Lord, on\
      \ my affliction,\n    for the enemy has triumphed.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The enemy laid hands\n    on all her treasures;\nshe saw pagan nations\n\
      \    enter her sanctuary—\nthose you had forbidden\n    to enter your assembly.\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ All her people groan\n    as they search for bread;\nthey barter their\
      \ treasures for food\n    to keep themselves alive.\n“Look, Lord, and consider,\n\
      \    for I am despised.” \n"
    12: "¹² “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n    Look around and see.\n\
      Is any suffering like my suffering\n    that was inflicted on me,\nthat the\
      \ Lord brought on me\n    in the day of his fierce anger? \n"
    13: "¹³ “From on high he sent fire,\n    sent it down into my bones.\nHe spread\
      \ a net for my feet\n    and turned me back.\nHe made me desolate,\n    faint\
      \ all the day long. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “My sins have been bound into a yoke;\n    by his hands they were woven\
      \ together.\nThey have been hung on my neck,\n    and the Lord has sapped my\
      \ strength.\nHe has given me into the hands\n    of those I cannot withstand.\
      \ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “The Lord has rejected\n    all the warriors in my midst;\nhe has summoned\
      \ an army against me\n    to crush my young men.\nIn his winepress the Lord\
      \ has trampled\n    Virgin Daughter Judah. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “This is why I weep\n    and my eyes overflow with tears.\nNo one is near\
      \ to comfort me,\n    no one to restore my spirit.\nMy children are destitute\n\
      \    because the enemy has prevailed.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Zion stretches out her hands,\n    but there is no one to comfort her.\n\
      The Lord has decreed for Jacob\n    that his neighbors become his foes;\nJerusalem\
      \ has become\n    an unclean thing among them. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The Lord is righteous,\n    yet I rebelled against his command.\nListen,\
      \ all you peoples;\n    look on my suffering.\nMy young men and young women\n\
      \    have gone into exile. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “I called to my allies\n    but they betrayed me.\nMy priests and my elders\n\
      \    perished in the city\nwhile they searched for food\n    to keep themselves\
      \ alive. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “See, Lord, how distressed I am!\n    I am in torment within,\nand in\
      \ my heart I am disturbed,\n    for I have been most rebellious.\nOutside, the\
      \ sword bereaves;\n    inside, there is only death. \n"
    21: "²¹ “People have heard my groaning,\n    but there is no one to comfort me.\n\
      All my enemies have heard of my distress;\n    they rejoice at what you have\
      \ done.\nMay you bring the day you have announced\n    so they may become like\
      \ me. \n"
    22: "²² “Let all their wickedness come before you;\n    deal with them\nas you\
      \ have dealt with me\n    because of all my sins.\nMy groans are many\n    and\
      \ my heart is faint.”"
  2:
    1: "How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion\n    with the cloud of his anger!\n\
      He has hurled down the splendor of Israel\n    from heaven to earth;\nhe has\
      \ not remembered his footstool\n    in the day of his anger. \n"
    2: "² Without pity the Lord has swallowed up\n    all the dwellings of Jacob;\n\
      in his wrath he has torn down\n    the strongholds of Daughter Judah.\nHe has\
      \ brought her kingdom and its princes\n    down to the ground in dishonor. \n"
    3: "³ In fierce anger he has cut off\n    every horn of Israel.\nHe has withdrawn\
      \ his right hand\n    at the approach of the enemy.\nHe has burned in Jacob\
      \ like a flaming fire\n    that consumes everything around it. \n"
    4: "⁴ Like an enemy he has strung his bow;\n    his right hand is ready.\nLike\
      \ a foe he has slain\n    all who were pleasing to the eye;\nhe has poured out\
      \ his wrath like fire\n    on the tent of Daughter Zion. \n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord is like an enemy;\n    he has swallowed up Israel.\nHe has swallowed\
      \ up all her palaces\n    and destroyed her strongholds.\nHe has multiplied\
      \ mourning and lamentation\n    for Daughter Judah. \n"
    6: "⁶ He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden;\n    he has destroyed his\
      \ place of meeting.\nThe Lord has made Zion forget\n    her appointed festivals\
      \ and her Sabbaths;\nin his fierce anger he has spurned\n    both king and priest.\
      \ \n"
    7: "⁷ The Lord has rejected his altar\n    and abandoned his sanctuary.\nHe has\
      \ given the walls of her palaces\n    into the hands of the enemy;\nthey have\
      \ raised a shout in the house of the Lord\n    as on the day of an appointed\
      \ festival. \n"
    8: "⁸ The Lord determined to tear down\n    the wall around Daughter Zion.\nHe\
      \ stretched out a measuring line\n    and did not withhold his hand from destroying.\n\
      He made ramparts and walls lament;\n    together they wasted away. \n"
    9: "⁹ Her gates have sunk into the ground;\n    their bars he has broken and destroyed.\n\
      Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations,\n    the law is no more,\n\
      and her prophets no longer find\n    visions from the Lord. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ The elders of Daughter Zion\n    sit on the ground in silence;\nthey have\
      \ sprinkled dust on their heads\n    and put on sackcloth.\nThe young women\
      \ of Jerusalem\n    have bowed their heads to the ground. \n"
    11: "¹¹ My eyes fail from weeping,\n    I am in torment within;\nmy heart is poured\
      \ out on the ground\n    because my people are destroyed,\nbecause children\
      \ and infants faint\n    in the streets of the city. \n"
    12: "¹² They say to their mothers,\n    “Where is bread and wine?”\nas they faint\
      \ like the wounded\n    in the streets of the city,\nas their lives ebb away\n\
      \    in their mothers’ arms. \n"
    13: "¹³ What can I say for you?\n    With what can I compare you,\n    Daughter\
      \ Jerusalem?\nTo what can I liken you,\n    that I may comfort you,\n    Virgin\
      \ Daughter Zion?\nYour wound is as deep as the sea.\n    Who can heal you? \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The visions of your prophets\n    were false and worthless;\nthey did\
      \ not expose your sin\n    to ward off your captivity.\nThe prophecies they\
      \ gave you\n    were false and misleading. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ All who pass your way\n    clap their hands at you;\nthey scoff and shake\
      \ their heads\n    at Daughter Jerusalem:\n“Is this the city that was called\n\
      \    the perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of the whole earth?” \n"
    16: "¹⁶ All your enemies open their mouths\n    wide against you;\nthey scoff\
      \ and gnash their teeth\n    and say, “We have swallowed her up.\nThis is the\
      \ day we have waited for;\n    we have lived to see it.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord has done what he planned;\n    he has fulfilled his word,\n \
      \   which he decreed long ago.\nHe has overthrown you without pity,\n    he\
      \ has let the enemy gloat over you,\n    he has exalted the horn of your foes.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The hearts of the people\n    cry out to the Lord.\nYou walls of Daughter\
      \ Zion,\n    let your tears flow like a river\n    day and night;\ngive yourself\
      \ no relief,\n    your eyes no rest. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ Arise, cry out in the night,\n    as the watches of the night begin;\n\
      pour out your heart like water\n    in the presence of the Lord.\nLift up your\
      \ hands to him\n    for the lives of your children,\nwho faint from hunger\n\
      \    at every street corner. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Look, Lord, and consider:\n    Whom have you ever treated like this?\n\
      Should women eat their offspring,\n    the children they have cared for?\nShould\
      \ priest and prophet be killed\n    in the sanctuary of the Lord? \n"
    21: "²¹ “Young and old lie together\n    in the dust of the streets;\nmy young\
      \ men and young women\n    have fallen by the sword.\nYou have slain them in\
      \ the day of your anger;\n    you have slaughtered them without pity. \n"
    22: "²² “As you summon to a feast day,\n    so you summoned against me terrors\
      \ on every side.\nIn the day of the Lord’s anger\n    no one escaped or survived;\n\
      those I cared for and reared\n    my enemy has destroyed.”"
  3:
    1: "I am the man who has seen affliction\n    by the rod of the Lord’s wrath.\n"
    2: "² He has driven me away and made me walk\n    in darkness rather than light;\n"
    3: "³ indeed, he has turned his hand against me\n    again and again, all day\
      \ long. \n"
    4: "⁴ He has made my skin and my flesh grow old\n    and has broken my bones.\n"
    5: "⁵ He has besieged me and surrounded me\n    with bitterness and hardship.\n"
    6: "⁶ He has made me dwell in darkness\n    like those long dead. \n"
    7: "⁷ He has walled me in so I cannot escape;\n    he has weighed me down with\
      \ chains.\n"
    8: "⁸ Even when I call out or cry for help,\n    he shuts out my prayer.\n"
    9: "⁹ He has barred my way with blocks of stone;\n    he has made my paths crooked.\
      \ \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Like a bear lying in wait,\n    like a lion in hiding,\n"
    11: "¹¹ he dragged me from the path and mangled me\n    and left me without help.\n"
    12: "¹² He drew his bow\n    and made me the target for his arrows. \n"
    13: "¹³ He pierced my heart\n    with arrows from his quiver.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ I became the laughingstock of all my people;\n    they mock me in song\
      \ all day long.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ He has filled me with bitter herbs\n    and given me gall to drink. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ He has broken my teeth with gravel;\n    he has trampled me in the dust.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I have been deprived of peace;\n    I have forgotten what prosperity is.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ So I say, “My splendor is gone\n    and all that I had hoped from the\
      \ Lord.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ I remember my affliction and my wandering,\n    the bitterness and the\
      \ gall.\n"
    20: "²⁰ I well remember them,\n    and my soul is downcast within me.\n"
    21: "²¹ Yet this I call to mind\n    and therefore I have hope: \n"
    22: "²² Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed,\n    for his compassions\
      \ never fail.\n"
    23: "²³ They are new every morning;\n    great is your faithfulness.\n"
    24: "²⁴ I say to myself, “The Lord is my portion;\n    therefore I will wait for\
      \ him.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him,\n    to the one who seeks\
      \ him;\n"
    26: "²⁶ it is good to wait quietly\n    for the salvation of the Lord.\n"
    27: "²⁷ It is good for a man to bear the yoke\n    while he is young. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Let him sit alone in silence,\n    for the Lord has laid it on him.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Let him bury his face in the dust—\n    there may yet be hope.\n"
    30: "³⁰ Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him,\n    and let him\
      \ be filled with disgrace. \n"
    31: "³¹ For no one is cast off\n    by the Lord forever.\n"
    32: "³² Though he brings grief, he will show compassion,\n    so great is his\
      \ unfailing love.\n"
    33: "³³ For he does not willingly bring affliction\n    or grief to anyone. \n"
    34: "³⁴ To crush underfoot\n    all prisoners in the land,\n"
    35: "³⁵ to deny people their rights\n    before the Most High,\n"
    36: "³⁶ to deprive them of justice—\n    would not the Lord see such things? \n"
    37: "³⁷ Who can speak and have it happen\n    if the Lord has not decreed it?\n"
    38: "³⁸ Is it not from the mouth of the Most High\n    that both calamities and\
      \ good things come?\n"
    39: "³⁹ Why should the living complain\n    when punished for their sins? \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Let us examine our ways and test them,\n    and let us return to the Lord.\n"
    41: "⁴¹ Let us lift up our hearts and our hands\n    to God in heaven, and say:\n"
    42: "⁴² “We have sinned and rebelled\n    and you have not forgiven. \n"
    43: "⁴³ “You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us;\n    you have slain\
      \ without pity.\n"
    44: "⁴⁴ You have covered yourself with a cloud\n    so that no prayer can get\
      \ through.\n"
    45: "⁴⁵ You have made us scum and refuse\n    among the nations. \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ “All our enemies have opened their mouths\n    wide against us.\n"
    47: "⁴⁷ We have suffered terror and pitfalls,\n    ruin and destruction.”\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Streams of tears flow from my eyes\n    because my people are destroyed.\
      \ \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ My eyes will flow unceasingly,\n    without relief,\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ until the Lord looks down\n    from heaven and sees.\n"
    51: "⁵¹ What I see brings grief to my soul\n    because of all the women of my\
      \ city. \n"
    52: "⁵² Those who were my enemies without cause\n    hunted me like a bird.\n"
    53: "⁵³ They tried to end my life in a pit\n    and threw stones at me;\n"
    54: "⁵⁴ the waters closed over my head,\n    and I thought I was about to perish.\
      \ \n"
    55: "⁵⁵ I called on your name, Lord,\n    from the depths of the pit.\n"
    56: "⁵⁶ You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears\n    to my cry for relief.”\n"
    57: "⁵⁷ You came near when I called you,\n    and you said, “Do not fear.” \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ You, Lord, took up my case;\n    you redeemed my life.\n"
    59: "⁵⁹ Lord, you have seen the wrong done to me.\n    Uphold my cause!\n"
    60: "⁶⁰ You have seen the depth of their vengeance,\n    all their plots against\
      \ me. \n"
    61: "⁶¹ Lord, you have heard their insults,\n    all their plots against me—\n"
    62: "⁶² what my enemies whisper and mutter\n    against me all day long.\n"
    63: "⁶³ Look at them! Sitting or standing,\n    they mock me in their songs. \n"

      \ done.\n"
    65: "⁶⁵ Put a veil over their hearts,\n    and may your curse be on them!\n"
    66: "⁶⁶ Pursue them in anger and destroy them\n    from under the heavens of the\
      \ Lord."
  4:
    1: "How the gold has lost its luster,\n    the fine gold become dull!\nThe sacred\
      \ gems are scattered\n    at every street corner. \n"
    2: "² How the precious children of Zion,\n    once worth their weight in gold,\n\
      are now considered as pots of clay,\n    the work of a potter’s hands! \n"
    3: "³ Even jackals offer their breasts\n    to nurse their young,\nbut my people\
      \ have become heartless\n    like ostriches in the desert. \n"
    4: "⁴ Because of thirst the infant’s tongue\n    sticks to the roof of its mouth;\n\
      the children beg for bread,\n    but no one gives it to them. \n"
    5: "⁵ Those who once ate delicacies\n    are destitute in the streets.\nThose\
      \ brought up in royal purple\n    now lie on ash heaps. \n"
    6: "⁶ The punishment of my people\n    is greater than that of Sodom,\nwhich was\
      \ overthrown in a moment\n    without a hand turned to help her. \n"
    7: "⁷ Their princes were brighter than snow\n    and whiter than milk,\ntheir\

    8: "⁸ But now they are blacker than soot;\n    they are not recognized in the\
      \ streets.\nTheir skin has shriveled on their bones;\n    it has become as dry\

    9: "⁹ Those killed by the sword are better off\n    than those who die of famine;\n\

      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ But it happened because of the sins of her prophets\n    and the iniquities\
      \ of her priests,\nwho shed within her\n    the blood of the righteous. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Now they grope through the streets\n    as if they were blind.\nThey are\
      \ so defiled with blood\n    that no one dares to touch their garments. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Go away! You are unclean!” people cry to them.\n    “Away! Away! Don’t\

    16: "¹⁶ The Lord himself has scattered them;\n    he no longer watches over them.\n\
      The priests are shown no honor,\n    the elders no favor. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Moreover, our eyes failed,\n    looking in vain for help;\nfrom our towers\
