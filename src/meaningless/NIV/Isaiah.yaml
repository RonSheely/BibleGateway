Isaiah:
  1:
    1: "The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during\
      \ the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. \n"
    2: "² Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth!\n    For the Lord has spoken:\n“I reared\
      \ children and brought them up,\n    but they have rebelled against me.\n"
    3: "³ The ox knows its master,\n    the donkey its owner’s manger,\nbut Israel\
      \ does not know,\n    my people do not understand.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Woe to the sinful nation,\n    a people whose guilt is great,\na brood of\
      \ evildoers,\n    children given to corruption!\nThey have forsaken the Lord;\n\
      \    they have spurned the Holy One of Israel\n    and turned their backs on\
      \ him. \n"
    5: "⁵ Why should you be beaten anymore?\n    Why do you persist in rebellion?\n\
      Your whole head is injured,\n    your whole heart afflicted.\n"
    6: "⁶ From the sole of your foot to the top of your head\n    there is no soundness—\n\
      only wounds and welts\n    and open sores,\nnot cleansed or bandaged\n    or\
      \ soothed with olive oil. \n"
    7: "⁷ Your country is desolate,\n    your cities burned with fire;\nyour fields\
      \ are being stripped by foreigners\n    right before you,\n    laid waste as\
      \ when overthrown by strangers.\n"
    8: "⁸ Daughter Zion is left\n    like a shelter in a vineyard,\nlike a hut in\
      \ a cucumber field,\n    like a city under siege.\n"
    9: "⁹ Unless the Lord Almighty\n    had left us some survivors,\nwe would have\
      \ become like Sodom,\n    we would have been like Gomorrah. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Hear the word of the Lord,\n    you rulers of Sodom;\nlisten to the instruction\
      \ of our God,\n    you people of Gomorrah!\n"
    11: "¹¹ “The multitude of your sacrifices—\n    what are they to me?” says the\
      \ Lord.\n“I have more than enough of burnt offerings,\n    of rams and the fat\
      \ of fattened animals;\nI have no pleasure\n    in the blood of bulls and lambs\
      \ and goats.\n"
    12: "¹² When you come to appear before me,\n    who has asked this of you,\n \
      \   this trampling of my courts?\n"
    13: "¹³ Stop bringing meaningless offerings!\n    Your incense is detestable to\
      \ me.\nNew Moons, Sabbaths and convocations—\n    I cannot bear your worthless\
      \ assemblies.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals\n    I hate with all\
      \ my being.\nThey have become a burden to me;\n    I am weary of bearing them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ When you spread out your hands in prayer,\n    I hide my eyes from you;\n\
      even when you offer many prayers,\n    I am not listening.\nYour hands are full\
      \ of blood! \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Wash and make yourselves clean.\n    Take your evil deeds out of my sight;\n\
      \    stop doing wrong.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Learn to do right; seek justice.\n    Defend the oppressed.\nTake up the\
      \ cause of the fatherless;\n    plead the case of the widow. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Come now, let us settle the matter,”\n    says the Lord.\n“Though your\
      \ sins are like scarlet,\n    they shall be as white as snow;\nthough they are\
      \ red as crimson,\n    they shall be like wool.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ If you are willing and obedient,\n    you will eat the good things of\
      \ the land;\n"
    20: "²⁰ but if you resist and rebel,\n    you will be devoured by the sword.”\n\
      For the mouth of the Lord has spoken. \n"
    21: "²¹ See how the faithful city\n    has become a prostitute!\nShe once was\
      \ full of justice;\n    righteousness used to dwell in her—\n    but now murderers!\n"
    22: "²² Your silver has become dross,\n    your choice wine is diluted with water.\n"
    23: "²³ Your rulers are rebels,\n    partners with thieves;\nthey all love bribes\n\
      \    and chase after gifts.\nThey do not defend the cause of the fatherless;\n\
      \    the widow’s case does not come before them. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty,\n    the Mighty One of Israel,\
      \ declares:\n“Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes\n    and avenge myself on\
      \ my enemies.\n"
    25: "²⁵ I will turn my hand against you;\n    I will thoroughly purge away your\
      \ dross\n    and remove all your impurities.\n"
    26: "²⁶ I will restore your leaders as in days of old,\n    your rulers as at\
      \ the beginning.\nAfterward you will be called\n    the City of Righteousness,\n\
      \    the Faithful City.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Zion will be delivered with justice,\n    her penitent ones with righteousness.\n"
    28: "²⁸ But rebels and sinners will both be broken,\n    and those who forsake\
      \ the Lord will perish. \n"
    29: "²⁹ “You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks\n    in which you have\
      \ delighted;\nyou will be disgraced because of the gardens\n    that you have\
      \ chosen.\n"
    30: "³⁰ You will be like an oak with fading leaves,\n    like a garden without\
      \ water.\n"
    31: "³¹ The mighty man will become tinder\n    and his work a spark;\nboth will\
      \ burn together,\n    with no one to quench the fire.”"
  2:
    1: "This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: \n"
    2: "² In the last days\nthe mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established\n\
      \    as the highest of the mountains;\nit will be exalted above the hills,\n\
      \    and all nations will stream to it. \n"
    3: "³ Many peoples will come and say,\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain of\
      \ the Lord,\n    to the temple of the God of Jacob.\nHe will teach us his ways,\n\
      \    so that we may walk in his paths.”\nThe law will go out from Zion,\n  \
      \  the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\n"
    4: "⁴ He will judge between the nations\n    and will settle disputes for many\
      \ peoples.\nThey will beat their swords into plowshares\n    and their spears\
      \ into pruning hooks.\nNation will not take up sword against nation,\n    nor\
      \ will they train for war anymore. \n"
    5: "⁵ Come, descendants of Jacob,\n    let us walk in the light of the Lord. \n"
    6: "⁶ You, Lord, have abandoned your people,\n    the descendants of Jacob.\n\
      They are full of superstitions from the East;\n    they practice divination\
      \ like the Philistines\n    and embrace pagan customs.\n"
    7: "⁷ Their land is full of silver and gold;\n    there is no end to their treasures.\n\
      Their land is full of horses;\n    there is no end to their chariots.\n"
    8: "⁸ Their land is full of idols;\n    they bow down to the work of their hands,\n\
      \    to what their fingers have made.\n"
    9: "⁹ So people will be brought low\n    and everyone humbled—\n    do not forgive\
      \ them. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Go into the rocks, hide in the ground\n    from the fearful presence of\
      \ the Lord\n    and the splendor of his majesty!\n"
    11: "¹¹ The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled\n    and human pride brought\
      \ low;\nthe Lord alone will be exalted in that day. \n"
    12: "¹² The Lord Almighty has a day in store\n    for all the proud and lofty,\n\
      for all that is exalted\n    (and they will be humbled),\n"
    13: "¹³ for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty,\n    and all the oaks of\
      \ Bashan,\n"
    14: "¹⁴ for all the towering mountains\n    and all the high hills,\n"
    15: "¹⁵ for every lofty tower\n    and every fortified wall,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ for every trading ship\n    and every stately vessel.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The arrogance of man will be brought low\n    and human pride humbled;\n\
      the Lord alone will be exalted in that day,\n"
    18: "¹⁸     and the idols will totally disappear. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ People will flee to caves in the rocks\n    and to holes in the ground\n\
      from the fearful presence of the Lord\n    and the splendor of his majesty,\n\
      \    when he rises to shake the earth.\n"
    20: "²⁰ In that day people will throw away\n    to the moles and bats\ntheir idols\
      \ of silver and idols of gold,\n    which they made to worship.\n"
    21: "²¹ They will flee to caverns in the rocks\n    and to the overhanging crags\n\
      from the fearful presence of the Lord\n    and the splendor of his majesty,\n\
      \    when he rises to shake the earth. \n"
    22: "²² Stop trusting in mere humans,\n    who have but a breath in their nostrils.\n\
      \    Why hold them in esteem?"
  3:
    1: "See now, the Lord,\n    the Lord Almighty,\nis about to take from Jerusalem\
      \ and Judah\n    both supply and support:\nall supplies of food and all supplies\
      \ of water,\n"
    2: "²     the hero and the warrior,\nthe judge and the prophet,\n    the diviner\
      \ and the elder,\n"
    3: "³ the captain of fifty and the man of rank,\n    the counselor, skilled craftsman\
      \ and clever enchanter. \n"
    4: "⁴ “I will make mere youths their officials;\n    children will rule over them.”\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ People will oppress each other—\n    man against man, neighbor against neighbor.\n\
      The young will rise up against the old,\n    the nobody against the honored.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ A man will seize one of his brothers\n    in his father’s house, and say,\n\
      “You have a cloak, you be our leader;\n    take charge of this heap of ruins!”\n"
    7: "⁷ But in that day he will cry out,\n    “I have no remedy.\nI have no food\
      \ or clothing in my house;\n    do not make me the leader of the people.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Jerusalem staggers,\n    Judah is falling;\ntheir words and deeds are against\
      \ the Lord,\n    defying his glorious presence.\n"
    9: "⁹ The look on their faces testifies against them;\n    they parade their sin\
      \ like Sodom;\n    they do not hide it.\nWoe to them!\n    They have brought\
      \ disaster upon themselves. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Tell the righteous it will be well with them,\n    for they will enjoy\
      \ the fruit of their deeds.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to the wicked!\n    Disaster is upon them!\nThey will be paid back\n\
      \    for what their hands have done. \n"
    12: "¹² Youths oppress my people,\n    women rule over them.\nMy people, your\
      \ guides lead you astray;\n    they turn you from the path. \n"
    13: "¹³ The Lord takes his place in court;\n    he rises to judge the people.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ The Lord enters into judgment\n    against the elders and leaders of his\
      \ people:\n“It is you who have ruined my vineyard;\n    the plunder from the\
      \ poor is in your houses.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ What do you mean by crushing my people\n    and grinding the faces of\
      \ the poor?”\ndeclares the Lord, the Lord Almighty. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Lord says,\n    “The women of Zion are haughty,\nwalking along with\
      \ outstretched necks,\n    flirting with their eyes,\nstrutting along with swaying\
      \ hips,\n    with ornaments jingling on their ankles.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion;\n\
      \    the Lord will make their scalps bald.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands
      and crescent necklaces, '
    19: '¹⁹ the earrings and bracelets and veils, '
    20: '²⁰ the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, '
    21: '²¹ the signet rings and nose rings, '
    22: '²² the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses '
    23: "²³ and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls. \n"
    24: "²⁴ Instead of fragrance there will be a stench;\n    instead of a sash, a\
      \ rope;\ninstead of well-dressed hair, baldness;\n    instead of fine clothing,\
      \ sackcloth;\n    instead of beauty, branding.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Your men will fall by the sword,\n    your warriors in battle.\n"
    26: "²⁶ The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;\n    destitute, she will sit\
      \ on the ground."
  4:
    1: "¹ In that day seven women\n    will take hold of one man\nand say, “We will\
      \ eat our own food\n    and provide our own clothes;\nonly let us be called\
      \ by your name.\n    Take away our disgrace!” \n"
    2: '² In that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the
      fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel. '
    3: '³ Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy,
      all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem. '
    4: '⁴ The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse
      the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire. '
    5: '⁵ Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble
      there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything
      the glory will be a canopy. '
    6: ⁶ It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and
      hiding place from the storm and rain.
  5:
    1: "I will sing for the one I love\n    a song about his vineyard:\nMy loved one\
      \ had a vineyard\n    on a fertile hillside.\n"
    2: "² He dug it up and cleared it of stones\n    and planted it with the choicest\
      \ vines.\nHe built a watchtower in it\n    and cut out a winepress as well.\n\
      Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,\n    but it yielded only bad fruit.\
      \ \n"
    3: "³ “Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah,\n    judge between me\
      \ and my vineyard.\n"
    4: "⁴ What more could have been done for my vineyard\n    than I have done for\
      \ it?\nWhen I looked for good grapes,\n    why did it yield only bad?\n"
    5: "⁵ Now I will tell you\n    what I am going to do to my vineyard:\nI will take\
      \ away its hedge,\n    and it will be destroyed;\nI will break down its wall,\n\
      \    and it will be trampled.\n"
    6: "⁶ I will make it a wasteland,\n    neither pruned nor cultivated,\n    and\
      \ briers and thorns will grow there.\nI will command the clouds\n    not to\
      \ rain on it.” \n"
    7: "⁷ The vineyard of the Lord Almighty\n    is the nation of Israel,\nand the\
      \ people of Judah\n    are the vines he delighted in.\nAnd he looked for justice,\
      \ but saw bloodshed;\n    for righteousness, but heard cries of distress. \n"
    8: "⁸ Woe to you who add house to house\n    and join field to field\ntill no\
      \ space is left\n    and you live alone in the land. \n"
    9: "⁹ The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing:\n“Surely the great houses\
      \ will become desolate,\n    the fine mansions left without occupants.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine;\n    a homer of\
      \ seed will yield only an ephah of grain.” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Woe to those who rise early in the morning\n    to run after their drinks,\n\
      who stay up late at night\n    till they are inflamed with wine.\n"
    12: "¹² They have harps and lyres at their banquets,\n    pipes and timbrels and\
      \ wine,\nbut they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord,\n    no respect\
      \ for the work of his hands.\n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore my people will go into exile\n    for lack of understanding;\n\
      those of high rank will die of hunger\n    and the common people will be parched\
      \ with thirst.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Therefore Death expands its jaws,\n    opening wide its mouth;\ninto it\
      \ will descend their nobles and masses\n    with all their brawlers and revelers.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ So people will be brought low\n    and everyone humbled,\n    the eyes\
      \ of the arrogant humbled.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But the Lord Almighty will be exalted by his justice,\n    and the holy\
      \ God will be proved holy by his righteous acts.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture;\n    lambs will feed among\
      \ the ruins of the rich. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit,\n    and wickedness\
      \ as with cart ropes,\n"
    19: "¹⁹ to those who say, “Let God hurry;\n    let him hasten his work\n    so\
      \ we may see it.\nThe plan of the Holy One of Israel—\n    let it approach,\
      \ let it come into view,\n    so we may know it.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ Woe to those who call evil good\n    and good evil,\nwho put darkness\
      \ for light\n    and light for darkness,\nwho put bitter for sweet\n    and\
      \ sweet for bitter. \n"
    21: "²¹ Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes\n    and clever in their own\
      \ sight. \n"
    22: "²² Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine\n    and champions at mixing\
      \ drinks,\n"
    23: "²³ who acquit the guilty for a bribe,\n    but deny justice to the innocent.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw\n    and as dry grass sinks\
      \ down in the flames,\nso their roots will decay\n    and their flowers blow\
      \ away like dust;\nfor they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty\n   \
      \ and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Therefore the Lord’s anger burns against his people;\n    his hand is\
      \ raised and he strikes them down.\nThe mountains shake,\n    and the dead bodies\
      \ are like refuse in the streets.\nYet for all this, his anger is not turned\
      \ away,\n    his hand is still upraised. \n"
    26: "²⁶ He lifts up a banner for the distant nations,\n    he whistles for those\
      \ at the ends of the earth.\nHere they come,\n    swiftly and speedily!\n"
    27: "²⁷ Not one of them grows tired or stumbles,\n    not one slumbers or sleeps;\n\
      not a belt is loosened at the waist,\n    not a sandal strap is broken.\n"
    28: "²⁸ Their arrows are sharp,\n    all their bows are strung;\ntheir horses’\
      \ hooves seem like flint,\n    their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Their roar is like that of the lion,\n    they roar like young lions;\n\
      they growl as they seize their prey\n    and carry it off with no one to rescue.\n"
    30: "³⁰ In that day they will roar over it\n    like the roaring of the sea.\n\
      And if one looks at the land,\n    there is only darkness and distress;\n  \
      \  even the sun will be darkened by clouds."
  6:
    1: 'In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated
      on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. '
    2: '² Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered
      their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. '
    3: "³ And they were calling to one another:\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty;\n\
      \    the whole earth is full of his glory.” \n"
    4: "⁴ At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the\
      \ temple was filled with smoke. \n"
    5: "⁵ “Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and\
      \ I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the\
      \ Lord Almighty.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which
      he had taken with tongs from the altar. '
    7: "⁷ With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips;\
      \ your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will\
      \ go for us?”\nAnd I said, “Here am I. Send me!” \n"
    9: "⁹ He said, “Go and tell this people:\n“‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding;\n\
      \    be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Make the heart of this people calloused;\n    make their ears dull\n \
      \   and close their eyes.\nOtherwise they might see with their eyes,\n    hear\
      \ with their ears,\n    understand with their hearts,\nand turn and be healed.”\
      \ \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then I said, “For how long, Lord?”\nAnd he answered:\n“Until the cities\
      \ lie ruined\n    and without inhabitant,\nuntil the houses are left deserted\n\
      \    and the fields ruined and ravaged,\n"
    12: "¹² until the Lord has sent everyone far away\n    and the land is utterly\
      \ forsaken.\n"
    13: "¹³ And though a tenth remains in the land,\n    it will again be laid waste.\n\
      But as the terebinth and oak\n    leave stumps when they are cut down,\n   \
      \ so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.”"
  7:
    1: "When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin\
      \ of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against\
      \ Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it. \n"
    2: "² Now the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself with Ephraim”;\
      \ so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest\
      \ are shaken by the wind. \n"
    3: '³ Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to
      meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s
      Field. '
    4: '⁴ Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart
      because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger
      of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. '
    5: '⁵ Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, '
    6: '⁶ “Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves,
      and make the son of Tabeel king over it.” '

      \    a rule for this, a rule for that;\n    a little here, a little there—\n\
      so that as they go they will fall backward;\n    they will be injured and snared\

    26: "²⁶ His God instructs him\n    and teaches him the right way. \n"
    27: "²⁷ Caraway is not threshed with a sledge,\n    nor is the wheel of a cart\

    28: "²⁸ Grain must be ground to make bread;\n    so one does not go on threshing\

    17: "¹⁷ In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field\n\

    18: "¹⁸ In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,\n    and out of\

    20: "²⁰ The ruthless will vanish,\n    the mockers will disappear,\n    and all\

    23: "²³ When they see among them their children,\n    the work of my hands,\n\

    1: 'In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria
      attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. '
    2: '² Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from
      Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct

    3: "³ Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and\

    4: "⁴ The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:\n“‘This is what the great\

    5: '⁵ You say you have counsel and might for war—but you speak only empty words.
      On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? '
    6: '⁶ Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff,
      which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt
      to all who depend on him. '
    7: "⁷ But if you say to me, “We are depending on the Lord our God”—isn’t he the\
      \ one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem,\
      \ “You must worship before this altar”? \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give
      you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! '

    10: "¹⁰ Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the Lord?\
      \ The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’” \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak\

    12: "¹² But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my\

      deliver you! '
    15: "¹⁵ Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, ‘The\

    16: '¹⁶ “Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make

    21: "²¹ But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the\

    22: ²² Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary
      and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn,
      and told him what the field commander had said.
  37:
    1: 'When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and
      went into the temple of the Lord. '
    2: '² He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the
      leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. '
    3: '³ They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress
      and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there
      is no strength to deliver them. '
    4: "⁴ It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander,\

    5: '⁵ When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah, '
    6: '⁶ Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the Lord says: Do
      not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of
      the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. '
    7: "⁷ Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to\

    8: "⁸ When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish,\
      \ he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah. \n"
    9: '⁹ Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, was marching
      out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with
      this word: '
    10: '¹⁰ “Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive
      you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of
      Assyria.’ '
    11: '¹¹ Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries,
      destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? '
    12: '¹² Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver
      them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel
      Assar? '
    13: "¹³ Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings\

    14: '¹⁴ Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he
      went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord. '
    15: '¹⁵ And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord: '
    16: '¹⁶ “Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you
      alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. '
    17: "¹⁷ Give ear, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see; listen to all\

    18: '¹⁸ “It is true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples
      and their lands. '
    19: '¹⁹ They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they

    28: "²⁸ “But I know where you are\n    and when you come and go\n    and how you\

    29: "²⁹ Because you rage against me\n    and because your insolence has reached\
      \ my ears,\nI will put my hook in your nose\n    and my bit in your mouth,\n\

    9: "⁹ A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery: \n"

      Are you not a brood of rebels,\n    the offspring of liars?\n"
    5: "⁵ You burn with lust among the oaks\n    and under every spreading tree;\n\
      you sacrifice your children in the ravines\n    and under the overhanging crags.\n"
    6: "⁶ The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion;\n   \
      \ indeed, they are your lot.\nYes, to them you have poured out drink offerings\n\
      \    and offered grain offerings.\n    In view of all this, should I relent?\n"
    7: "⁷ You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill;\n    there you went up\
      \ to offer your sacrifices.\n"
    8: "⁸ Behind your doors and your doorposts\n    you have put your pagan symbols.\n\
      Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed,\n    you climbed into it and opened it\
      \ wide;\nyou made a pact with those whose beds you love,\n    and you looked\

    9: "⁹ You went to Molek with olive oil\n    and increased your perfumes.\nYou\
      \ sent your ambassadors far away;\n    you descended to the very realm of the\
      \ dead!\n"
    10: "¹⁰ You wearied yourself by such going about,\n    but you would not say,\
      \ ‘It is hopeless.’\nYou found renewal of your strength,\n    and so you did\
      \ not faint. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Whom have you so dreaded and feared\n    that you have not been true\
      \ to me,\nand have neither remembered me\n    nor taken this to heart?\nIs it\

    13: "¹³ When you cry out for help,\n    let your collection of idols save you!\n\

    15: "¹⁵ For this is what the high and exalted One says—\n    he who lives forever,\

    16: "¹⁶ I will not accuse them forever,\n    nor will I always be angry,\nfor\

    17: "¹⁷ I was enraged by their sinful greed;\n    I punished them, and hid my\
      \ face in anger,\n    yet they kept on in their willful ways.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ I have seen their ways, but I will heal them;\n    I will guide them and\

    20: "²⁰ But the wicked are like the tossing sea,\n    which cannot rest,\n   \

    21: ²¹ “There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
  58:
    1: "“Shout it aloud, do not hold back.\n    Raise your voice like a trumpet.\n\
      Declare to my people their rebellion\n    and to the descendants of Jacob their\
      \ sins.\n"
    2: "² For day after day they seek me out;\n    they seem eager to know my ways,\n\

    3: "³ ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say,\n    ‘and you have not seen it?\nWhy have\

      \ your fasting, you do as you please\n    and exploit all your workers.\n"
    4: "⁴ Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife,\n    and in striking each other\
      \ with wicked fists.\nYou cannot fast as you do today\n    and expect your voice\
      \ to be heard on high.\n"
    5: "⁵ Is this the kind of fast I have chosen,\n    only a day for people to humble\
      \ themselves?\nIs it only for bowing one’s head like a reed\n    and for lying\
      \ in sackcloth and ashes?\nIs that what you call a fast,\n    a day acceptable\
      \ to the Lord? \n"
    6: "⁶ “Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:\nto loose the chains of\
      \ injustice\n    and untie the cords of the yoke,\nto set the oppressed free\n\
      \    and break every yoke?\n"
    7: "⁷ Is it not to share your food with the hungry\n    and to provide the poor\
      \ wanderer with shelter—\nwhen you see the naked, to clothe them,\n    and not\
      \ to turn away from your own flesh and blood?\n"
    8: "⁸ Then your light will break forth like the dawn,\n    and your healing will\

    9: "⁹ Then you will call, and the Lord will answer;\n    you will cry for help,\
      \ and he will say: Here am I.\n“If you do away with the yoke of oppression,\n\

    10: "¹⁰ and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry\n    and satisfy the\
      \ needs of the oppressed,\nthen your light will rise in the darkness,\n    and\
      \ your night will become like the noonday.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will guide you always;\n    he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched\

    13: "¹³ “If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath\n    and from doing as\

  59:
    1: "Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save,\n    nor his ear too\
      \ dull to hear.\n"
    2: "² But your iniquities have separated\n    you from your God;\nyour sins have\

    3: "³ For your hands are stained with blood,\n    your fingers with guilt.\nYour\
      \ lips have spoken falsely,\n    and your tongue mutters wicked things.\n"
    4: "⁴ No one calls for justice;\n    no one pleads a case with integrity.\nThey\
      \ rely on empty arguments, they utter lies;\n    they conceive trouble and give\
      \ birth to evil.\n"
    5: "⁵ They hatch the eggs of vipers\n    and spin a spider’s web.\nWhoever eats\
      \ their eggs will die,\n    and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.\n"
    6: "⁶ Their cobwebs are useless for clothing;\n    they cannot cover themselves\

    7: "⁷ Their feet rush into sin;\n    they are swift to shed innocent blood.\n\
      They pursue evil schemes;\n    acts of violence mark their ways.\n"
    8: "⁸ The way of peace they do not know;\n    there is no justice in their paths.\n\
      They have turned them into crooked roads;\n    no one who walks along them will\
      \ know peace. \n"
    9: "⁹ So justice is far from us,\n    and righteousness does not reach us.\nWe\
      \ look for light, but all is darkness;\n    for brightness, but we walk in deep\
      \ shadows.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Like the blind we grope along the wall,\n    feeling our way like people\
      \ without eyes.\nAt midday we stumble as if it were twilight;\n    among the\
      \ strong, we are like the dead.\n"
    11: "¹¹ We all growl like bears;\n    we moan mournfully like doves.\nWe look\
      \ for justice, but find none;\n    for deliverance, but it is far away. \n"
    12: "¹² For our offenses are many in your sight,\n    and our sins testify against\
      \ us.\nOur offenses are ever with us,\n    and we acknowledge our iniquities:\n"
    13: "¹³ rebellion and treachery against the Lord,\n    turning our backs on our\
      \ God,\ninciting revolt and oppression,\n    uttering lies our hearts have conceived.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ So justice is driven back,\n    and righteousness stands at a distance;\n\
      truth has stumbled in the streets,\n    honesty cannot enter.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Truth is nowhere to be found,\n    and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.\n\
      The Lord looked and was displeased\n    that there was no justice.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ He saw that there was no one,\n    he was appalled that there was no one\
      \ to intervene;\nso his own arm achieved salvation for him,\n    and his own\
      \ righteousness sustained him.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He put on righteousness as his breastplate,\n    and the helmet of salvation\
      \ on his head;\nhe put on the garments of vengeance\n    and wrapped himself\
      \ in zeal as in a cloak.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ According to what they have done,\n    so will he repay\nwrath to his\
      \ enemies\n    and retribution to his foes;\n    he will repay the islands their\
      \ due.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ From the west, people will fear the name of the Lord,\n    and from the\
      \ rising of the sun, they will revere his glory.\nFor he will come like a pent-up\
      \ flood\n    that the breath of the Lord drives along. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “The Redeemer will come to Zion,\n    to those in Jacob who repent of\

    21: ²¹ “As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the Lord. “My Spirit,
      who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your
      mouth will always be on your lips, on the lips of your children and on the lips
      of their descendants—from this time on and forever,” says the Lord.
  60:

    14: "¹⁴ like cattle that go down to the plain,\n    they were given rest by the\
      \ Spirit of the Lord.\nThis is how you guided your people\n    to make for yourself\
      \ a glorious name. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Look down from heaven and see,\n    from your lofty throne, holy and glorious.\n\
      Where are your zeal and your might?\n    Your tenderness and compassion are\
      \ withheld from us.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ But you are our Father,\n    though Abraham does not know us\n    or Israel\
      \ acknowledge us;\nyou, Lord, are our Father,\n    our Redeemer from of old\
      \ is your name.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Why, Lord, do you make us wander from your ways\n    and harden our hearts\
      \ so we do not revere you?\nReturn for the sake of your servants,\n    the tribes\
      \ that are your inheritance.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ For a little while your people possessed your holy place,\n    but now\
      \ our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ We are yours from of old;\n    but you have not ruled over them,\n   \
      \ they have not been called by your name."
  64:
    1: "Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down,\n    that the mountains\
      \ would tremble before you!\n"
    2: "² As when fire sets twigs ablaze\n    and causes water to boil,\ncome down\
      \ to make your name known to your enemies\n    and cause the nations to quake\
      \ before you!\n"
    3: "³ For when you did awesome things that we did not expect,\n    you came down,\
      \ and the mountains trembled before you.\n"
    4: "⁴ Since ancient times no one has heard,\n    no ear has perceived,\nno eye\
      \ has seen any God besides you,\n    who acts on behalf of those who wait for\
      \ him.\n"
    5: "⁵ You come to the help of those who gladly do right,\n    who remember your\
      \ ways.\nBut when we continued to sin against them,\n    you were angry.\n \
      \   How then can we be saved?\n"
    6: "⁶ All of us have become like one who is unclean,\n    and all our righteous\
      \ acts are like filthy rags;\nwe all shrivel up like a leaf,\n    and like the\
      \ wind our sins sweep us away.\n"
    7: "⁷ No one calls on your name\n    or strives to lay hold of you;\nfor you have\
      \ hidden your face from us\n    and have given us over to our sins. \n"
    8: "⁸ Yet you, Lord, are our Father.\n    We are the clay, you are the potter;\n\
      \    we are all the work of your hand.\n"
    9: "⁹ Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord;\n    do not remember our sins forever.\n\
      Oh, look on us, we pray,\n    for we are all your people.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Your sacred cities have become a wasteland;\n    even Zion is a wasteland,\
      \ Jerusalem a desolation.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Our holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you,\n    has\
      \ been burned with fire,\n    and all that we treasured lies in ruins.\n"
    12: "¹² After all this, Lord, will you hold yourself back?\n    Will you keep\
      \ silent and punish us beyond measure?"
  65:
    1: "“I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me;\n    I was found by those\
      \ who did not seek me.\nTo a nation that did not call on my name,\n    I said,\
      \ ‘Here am I, here am I.’\n"
    2: "² All day long I have held out my hands\n    to an obstinate people,\nwho\
      \ walk in ways not good,\n    pursuing their own imaginations—\n"
    3: "³ a people who continually provoke me\n    to my very face,\noffering sacrifices\
      \ in gardens\n    and burning incense on altars of brick;\n"
    4: "⁴ who sit among the graves\n    and spend their nights keeping secret vigil;\n\
      who eat the flesh of pigs,\n    and whose pots hold broth of impure meat;\n"
    5: "⁵ who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me,\n    for I am too sacred for you!’\n\
      Such people are smoke in my nostrils,\n    a fire that keeps burning all day.\
      \ \n"
    6: "⁶ “See, it stands written before me:\n    I will not keep silent but will\
      \ pay back in full;\n    I will pay it back into their laps—\n"
    7: "⁷ both your sins and the sins of your ancestors,”\n    says the Lord.\n“Because\
      \ they burned sacrifices on the mountains\n    and defied me on the hills,\n\
      I will measure into their laps\n    the full payment for their former deeds.”\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ This is what the Lord says:\n“As when juice is still found in a cluster\
      \ of grapes\n    and people say, ‘Don’t destroy it,\n    there is still a blessing\
      \ in it,’\nso will I do in behalf of my servants;\n    I will not destroy them\
      \ all.\n"
    9: "⁹ I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,\n    and from Judah those who\
      \ will possess my mountains;\nmy chosen people will inherit them,\n    and there\
      \ will my servants live.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Sharon will become a pasture for flocks,\n    and the Valley of Achor\
      \ a resting place for herds,\n    for my people who seek me. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “But as for you who forsake the Lord\n    and forget my holy mountain,\n\
      who spread a table for Fortune\n    and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,\n"
    12: "¹² I will destine you for the sword,\n    and all of you will fall in the\
      \ slaughter;\nfor I called but you did not answer,\n    I spoke but you did\
      \ not listen.\nYou did evil in my sight\n    and chose what displeases me.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:\n“My servants will eat,\n\
      \    but you will go hungry;\nmy servants will drink,\n    but you will go thirsty;\n\
      my servants will rejoice,\n    but you will be put to shame.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ My servants will sing\n    out of the joy of their hearts,\nbut you will\
      \ cry out\n    from anguish of heart\n    and wail in brokenness of spirit.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ You will leave your name\n    for my chosen ones to use in their curses;\n\
      the Sovereign Lord will put you to death,\n    but to his servants he will give\
      \ another name.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ Whoever invokes a blessing in the land\n    will do so by the one true\
      \ God;\nwhoever takes an oath in the land\n    will swear by the one true God.\n\
      For the past troubles will be forgotten\n    and hidden from my eyes. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “See, I will create\n    new heavens and a new earth.\nThe former things\
      \ will not be remembered,\n    nor will they come to mind.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ But be glad and rejoice forever\n    in what I will create,\nfor I will\
      \ create Jerusalem to be a delight\n    and its people a joy.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will rejoice over Jerusalem\n    and take delight in my people;\nthe\
      \ sound of weeping and of crying\n    will be heard in it no more. \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Never again will there be in it\n    an infant who lives but a few days,\n\
      \    or an old man who does not live out his years;\nthe one who dies at a hundred\n\
      \    will be thought a mere child;\nthe one who fails to reach a hundred\n \
      \   will be considered accursed.\n"
    21: "²¹ They will build houses and dwell in them;\n    they will plant vineyards\
      \ and eat their fruit.\n"
    22: "²² No longer will they build houses and others live in them,\n    or plant\
      \ and others eat.\nFor as the days of a tree,\n    so will be the days of my\
      \ people;\nmy chosen ones will long enjoy\n    the work of their hands.\n"
    23: "²³ They will not labor in vain,\n    nor will they bear children doomed to\
      \ misfortune;\nfor they will be a people blessed by the Lord,\n    they and\
      \ their descendants with them.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Before they call I will answer;\n    while they are still speaking I will\
      \ hear.\n"
    25: "²⁵ The wolf and the lamb will feed together,\n    and the lion will eat straw\
      \ like the ox,\n    and dust will be the serpent’s food.\nThey will neither\
      \ harm nor destroy\n    on all my holy mountain,”\nsays the Lord."
  66:
    1: "This is what the Lord says:\n“Heaven is my throne,\n    and the earth is my\
      \ footstool.\nWhere is the house you will build for me?\n    Where will my resting\
      \ place be?\n"
    2: "² Has not my hand made all these things,\n    and so they came into being?”\n\
      declares the Lord.\n“These are the ones I look on with favor:\n    those who\
      \ are humble and contrite in spirit,\n    and who tremble at my word.\n"
    3: "³ But whoever sacrifices a bull\n    is like one who kills a person,\nand\
      \ whoever offers a lamb\n    is like one who breaks a dog’s neck;\nwhoever makes\
      \ a grain offering\n    is like one who presents pig’s blood,\nand whoever burns\
      \ memorial incense\n    is like one who worships an idol.\nThey have chosen\
      \ their own ways,\n    and they delight in their abominations;\n"
    4: "⁴ so I also will choose harsh treatment for them\n    and will bring on them\
      \ what they dread.\nFor when I called, no one answered,\n    when I spoke, no\
      \ one listened.\nThey did evil in my sight\n    and chose what displeases me.”\
      \ \n"
    5: "⁵ Hear the word of the Lord,\n    you who tremble at his word:\n“Your own\
      \ people who hate you,\n    and exclude you because of my name, have said,\n\
      ‘Let the Lord be glorified,\n    that we may see your joy!’\n    Yet they will\
      \ be put to shame.\n"
    6: "⁶ Hear that uproar from the city,\n    hear that noise from the temple!\n\
      It is the sound of the Lord\n    repaying his enemies all they deserve. \n"
    7: "⁷ “Before she goes into labor,\n    she gives birth;\nbefore the pains come\
      \ upon her,\n    she delivers a son.\n"
    8: "⁸ Who has ever heard of such things?\n    Who has ever seen things like this?\n\
      Can a country be born in a day\n    or a nation be brought forth in a moment?\n\
      Yet no sooner is Zion in labor\n    than she gives birth to her children.\n"
    9: "⁹ Do I bring to the moment of birth\n    and not give delivery?” says the\
      \ Lord.\n“Do I close up the womb\n    when I bring to delivery?” says your God.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her,\n    all you who love her;\n\
      rejoice greatly with her,\n    all you who mourn over her.\n"
    11: "¹¹ For you will nurse and be satisfied\n    at her comforting breasts;\n\
      you will drink deeply\n    and delight in her overflowing abundance.” \n"
    12: "¹² For this is what the Lord says:\n“I will extend peace to her like a river,\n\
      \    and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream;\nyou will nurse and be\
      \ carried on her arm\n    and dandled on her knees.\n"
    13: "¹³ As a mother comforts her child,\n    so will I comfort you;\n    and you\
      \ will be comforted over Jerusalem.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ When you see this, your heart will rejoice\n    and you will flourish\
      \ like grass;\nthe hand of the Lord will be made known to his servants,\n  \
      \  but his fury will be shown to his foes.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ See, the Lord is coming with fire,\n    and his chariots are like a whirlwind;\n\
      he will bring down his anger with fury,\n    and his rebuke with flames of fire.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ For with fire and with his sword\n    the Lord will execute judgment on\
      \ all people,\n    and many will be those slain by the Lord. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following\
      \ one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats and other unclean things—they\
      \ will meet their end together with the one they follow,” declares the Lord.\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come and\
      \ gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see\
      \ my glory. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive
      to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers),
      to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame
      or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. '
    20: '²⁰ And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy
      mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord—on horses, in chariots and
      wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the Lord. “They will bring them, as the
      Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the Lord in ceremonially
      clean vessels. '
    21: "²¹ And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,” says the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    22: '²² “As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,”
      declares the Lord, “so will your name and descendants endure. '
    23: '²³ From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind
      will come and bow down before me,” says the Lord. '
    24: ²⁴ “And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled
      against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will
      not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
