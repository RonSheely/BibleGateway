    30: "³⁰ Since they would not accept my advice\n    and spurned my rebuke,\n"
    31: "³¹ they will eat the fruit of their ways\n    and be filled with the fruit\
      \ of their schemes.\n"
    32: "³² For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,\n    and the complacency\

    3: "³ For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,\n    and her speech is\
      \ smoother than oil;\n"
    4: "⁴ but in the end she is bitter as gall,\n    sharp as a double-edged sword.\n"
    5: "⁵ Her feet go down to death;\n    her steps lead straight to the grave.\n"

      \    may you ever be intoxicated with her love.\n"
    20: "²⁰ Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife?\n    Why embrace\
      \ the bosom of a wayward woman? \n"
    21: "²¹ For your ways are in full view of the Lord,\n    and he examines all your\
      \ paths.\n"

      \ hold them fast.\n"
    23: "²³ For lack of discipline they will die,\n    led astray by their own great\
      \ folly."

      \ hands in pledge for a stranger,\n"
    2: "² you have been trapped by what you said,\n    ensnared by the words of your\
      \ mouth.\n"
    3: "³ So do this, my son, to free yourself,\n    since you have fallen into your\
      \ neighbor’s hands:\nGo—to the point of exhaustion—\n    and give your neighbor\
      \ no rest!\n"
    4: "⁴ Allow no sleep to your eyes,\n    no slumber to your eyelids.\n"
    5: "⁵ Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,\n    like a bird\
      \ from the snare of the fowler. \n"

      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ How long will you lie there, you sluggard?\n    When will you get up from\
      \ your sleep?\n"
    10: "¹⁰ A little sleep, a little slumber,\n    a little folding of the hands to\
      \ rest—\n"
    11: "¹¹ and poverty will come on you like a thief\n    and scarcity like an armed\
      \ man. \n"
    12: "¹² A troublemaker and a villain,\n    who goes about with a corrupt mouth,\n"
    13: "¹³     who winks maliciously with his eye,\n    signals with his feet\n \
      \   and motions with his fingers,\n"
    14: "¹⁴     who plots evil with deceit in his heart—\n    he always stirs up conflict.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant;\n    he will suddenly\
      \ be destroyed—without remedy. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ There are six things the Lord hates,\n    seven that are detestable to\
      \ him:\n"
    17: "¹⁷         haughty eyes,\n        a lying tongue,\n        hands that shed\
      \ innocent blood,\n"
    18: "¹⁸         a heart that devises wicked schemes,\n        feet that are quick\
      \ to rush into evil,\n"
    19: "¹⁹         a false witness who pours out lies\n        and a person who stirs\
      \ up conflict in the community. \n"

    22: "²² When you walk, they will guide you;\n    when you sleep, they will watch\

    23: "²³ For this command is a lamp,\n    this teaching is a light,\nand correction\
      \ and instruction\n    are the way to life,\n"
    24: "²⁴ keeping you from your neighbor’s wife,\n    from the smooth talk of a\
      \ wayward woman. \n"
    25: "²⁵ Do not lust in your heart after her beauty\n    or let her captivate you\
      \ with her eyes. \n"
    26: "²⁶ For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread,\n    but another man’s\
      \ wife preys on your very life.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Can a man scoop fire into his lap\n    without his clothes being burned?\n"
    28: "²⁸ Can a man walk on hot coals\n    without his feet being scorched?\n"

      \ will go unpunished. \n"
    30: "³⁰ People do not despise a thief if he steals\n    to satisfy his hunger\
      \ when he is starving.\n"
    31: "³¹ Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold,\n    though it costs him all\
      \ the wealth of his house.\n"
    32: "³² But a man who commits adultery has no sense;\n    whoever does so destroys\
      \ himself.\n"
    33: "³³ Blows and disgrace are his lot,\n    and his shame will never be wiped\
      \ away. \n"
    34: "³⁴ For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury,\n    and he will show no mercy\
      \ when he takes revenge.\n"
    35: "³⁵ He will not accept any compensation;\n    he will refuse a bribe, however\
      \ great it is."

    12: "¹² now in the street, now in the squares,\n    at every corner she lurks.)\n"
    13: "¹³ She took hold of him and kissed him\n    and with a brazen face she said:\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Today I fulfilled my vows,\n    and I have food from my fellowship offering\
      \ at home.\n"
