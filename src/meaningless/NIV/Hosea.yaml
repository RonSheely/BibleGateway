Hosea:
  1:
    1: "The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of\
      \ Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of\
      \ Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel: \n"
    2: '² When the Lord began to speak through Hosea, the Lord said to him, “Go, marry
      a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife
      this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord.” '
    3: "³ So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him\
      \ a son. \n"
    4: '⁴ Then the Lord said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish
      the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the
      kingdom of Israel. '
    5: "⁵ In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the Lord said to
      Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means “not loved”), for I will no longer
      show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them. '
    7: "⁷ Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or\
      \ battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the Lord their God, will save them.”\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. '
    9: "⁹ Then the Lord said, “Call him Lo-Ammi (which means “not my people”), for\
      \ you are not my people, and I am not your God. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot
      be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not
      my people,’ they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ '
    11: ¹¹ The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will
      appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day
      of Jezreel.
  2:
    1: "“Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved one.’ \n"
    2: "² “Rebuke your mother, rebuke her,\n    for she is not my wife,\n    and I\
      \ am not her husband.\nLet her remove the adulterous look from her face\n  \
      \  and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.\n"
    3: "³ Otherwise I will strip her naked\n    and make her as bare as on the day\
      \ she was born;\nI will make her like a desert,\n    turn her into a parched\
      \ land,\n    and slay her with thirst.\n"
    4: "⁴ I will not show my love to her children,\n    because they are the children\
      \ of adultery.\n"
    5: "⁵ Their mother has been unfaithful\n    and has conceived them in disgrace.\n\
      She said, ‘I will go after my lovers,\n    who give me my food and my water,\n\
      \    my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.’\n"
    6: "⁶ Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes;\n    I will wall her in\
      \ so that she cannot find her way.\n"
    7: "⁷ She will chase after her lovers but not catch them;\n    she will look for\
      \ them but not find them.\nThen she will say,\n    ‘I will go back to my husband\
      \ as at first,\n    for then I was better off than now.’\n"
    8: "⁸ She has not acknowledged that I was the one\n    who gave her the grain,\
      \ the new wine and oil,\nwho lavished on her the silver and gold—\n    which\
      \ they used for Baal. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens,\n    and my new wine\
      \ when it is ready.\nI will take back my wool and my linen,\n    intended to\
      \ cover her naked body.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ So now I will expose her lewdness\n    before the eyes of her lovers;\n\
      \    no one will take her out of my hands.\n"
    11: "¹¹ I will stop all her celebrations:\n    her yearly festivals, her New Moons,\n\
      \    her Sabbath days—all her appointed festivals.\n"
    12: "¹² I will ruin her vines and her fig trees,\n    which she said were her\
      \ pay from her lovers;\nI will make them a thicket,\n    and wild animals will\
      \ devour them.\n"
    13: "¹³ I will punish her for the days\n    she burned incense to the Baals;\n\
      she decked herself with rings and jewelry,\n    and went after her lovers,\n\
      \    but me she forgot,”\ndeclares the Lord. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Therefore I am now going to allure her;\n    I will lead her into the\
      \ wilderness\n    and speak tenderly to her.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ There I will give her back her vineyards,\n    and will make the Valley\
      \ of Achor a door of hope.\nThere she will respond as in the days of her youth,\n\
      \    as in the day she came up out of Egypt. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “In that day,” declares the Lord,\n    “you will call me ‘my husband’;\n\
      \    you will no longer call me ‘my master.’\n"
    17: "¹⁷ I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips;\n    no longer will\
      \ their names be invoked.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ In that day I will make a covenant for them\n    with the beasts of the\
      \ field, the birds in the sky\n    and the creatures that move along the ground.\n\
      Bow and sword and battle\n    I will abolish from the land,\n    so that all\
      \ may lie down in safety.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ I will betroth you to me forever;\n    I will betroth you in righteousness\
      \ and justice,\n    in love and compassion.\n"
    20: "²⁰ I will betroth you in faithfulness,\n    and you will acknowledge the\
      \ Lord. \n"
    21: "²¹ “In that day I will respond,”\n    declares the Lord—\n“I will respond\
      \ to the skies,\n    and they will respond to the earth;\n"
    22: "²² and the earth will respond to the grain,\n    the new wine and the olive\
      \ oil,\n    and they will respond to Jezreel.\n"
    23: "²³ I will plant her for myself in the land;\n    I will show my love to the\
      \ one I called ‘Not my loved one.’\nI will say to those called ‘Not my people,’\
      \ ‘You are my people’;\n    and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”"
  3:
    1: "The Lord said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is\
      \ loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the Lord loves the\
      \ Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.”\
      \ \n"
    2: '² So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek
      of barley. '
    3: "³ Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute\
      \ or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.” \n"
    4: '⁴ For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice
      or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. '
    5: ⁵ Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and David
      their king. They will come trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the
      last days.
  4:
    1: "Hear the word of the Lord, you Israelites,\n    because the Lord has a charge\
      \ to bring\n    against you who live in the land:\n“There is no faithfulness,\
      \ no love,\n    no acknowledgment of God in the land.\n"
    2: "² There is only cursing, lying and murder,\n    stealing and adultery;\nthey\
      \ break all bounds,\n    and bloodshed follows bloodshed.\n"
    3: "³ Because of this the land dries up,\n    and all who live in it waste away;\n\
      the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky\n    and the fish in the sea are\
      \ swept away. \n"
    4: "⁴ “But let no one bring a charge,\n    let no one accuse another,\nfor your\
      \ people are like those\n    who bring charges against a priest.\n"
    5: "⁵ You stumble day and night,\n    and the prophets stumble with you.\nSo I\
      \ will destroy your mother—\n"
    6: "⁶     my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge.\n“Because you have rejected\
      \ knowledge,\n    I also reject you as my priests;\nbecause you have ignored\
      \ the law of your God,\n    I also will ignore your children.\n"
    7: "⁷ The more priests there were,\n    the more they sinned against me;\n   \
      \ they exchanged their glorious God for something disgraceful.\n"
    8: "⁸ They feed on the sins of my people\n    and relish their wickedness.\n"
    9: "⁹ And it will be: Like people, like priests.\n    I will punish both of them\
      \ for their ways\n    and repay them for their deeds. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “They will eat but not have enough;\n    they will engage in prostitution\
      \ but not flourish,\nbecause they have deserted the Lord\n    to give themselves "
    11: "¹¹ to prostitution;\nold wine and new wine\n    take away their understanding.\n"
    12: "¹² My people consult a wooden idol,\n    and a diviner’s rod speaks to them.\n\
      A spirit of prostitution leads them astray;\n    they are unfaithful to their\
      \ God.\n"
    13: "¹³ They sacrifice on the mountaintops\n    and burn offerings on the hills,\n\
      under oak, poplar and terebinth,\n    where the shade is pleasant.\nTherefore\
      \ your daughters turn to prostitution\n    and your daughters-in-law to adultery.\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I will not punish your daughters\n    when they turn to prostitution,\n\
      nor your daughters-in-law\n    when they commit adultery,\nbecause the men themselves\
      \ consort with harlots\n    and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes—\n    a people\
      \ without understanding will come to ruin! \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Though you, Israel, commit adultery,\n    do not let Judah become guilty.\n\
      “Do not go to Gilgal;\n    do not go up to Beth Aven.\n    And do not swear,\
      \ ‘As surely as the Lord lives!’\n"
    16: "¹⁶ The Israelites are stubborn,\n    like a stubborn heifer.\nHow then can\
      \ the Lord pasture them\n    like lambs in a meadow?\n"
    17: "¹⁷ Ephraim is joined to idols;\n    leave him alone!\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Even when their drinks are gone,\n    they continue their prostitution;\n\
      \    their rulers dearly love shameful ways.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ A whirlwind will sweep them away,\n    and their sacrifices will bring\
      \ them shame."
  5:
    1: "“Hear this, you priests!\n    Pay attention, you Israelites!\nListen, royal\
      \ house!\n    This judgment is against you:\nYou have been a snare at Mizpah,\n\
      \    a net spread out on Tabor.\n"
    2: "² The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter.\n    I will discipline all of them.\n"
    3: "³ I know all about Ephraim;\n    Israel is not hidden from me.\nEphraim, you\
      \ have now turned to prostitution;\n    Israel is corrupt. \n"
    4: "⁴ “Their deeds do not permit them\n    to return to their God.\nA spirit of\
      \ prostitution is in their heart;\n    they do not acknowledge the Lord.\n"
    5: "⁵ Israel’s arrogance testifies against them;\n    the Israelites, even Ephraim,\
      \ stumble in their sin;\n    Judah also stumbles with them.\n"
    6: "⁶ When they go with their flocks and herds\n    to seek the Lord,\nthey will\
      \ not find him;\n    he has withdrawn himself from them.\n"
    7: "⁷ They are unfaithful to the Lord;\n    they give birth to illegitimate children.\n\
      When they celebrate their New Moon feasts,\n    he will devour their fields.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “Sound the trumpet in Gibeah,\n    the horn in Ramah.\nRaise the battle\
      \ cry in Beth Aven;\n    lead on, Benjamin.\n"
    9: "⁹ Ephraim will be laid waste\n    on the day of reckoning.\nAmong the tribes\
      \ of Israel\n    I proclaim what is certain.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Judah’s leaders are like those\n    who move boundary stones.\nI will\
      \ pour out my wrath on them\n    like a flood of water.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim is oppressed,\n    trampled in judgment,\n    intent on pursuing\
      \ idols.\n"
    12: "¹² I am like a moth to Ephraim,\n    like rot to the people of Judah. \n"
    13: "¹³ “When Ephraim saw his sickness,\n    and Judah his sores,\nthen Ephraim\
      \ turned to Assyria,\n    and sent to the great king for help.\nBut he is not\
      \ able to cure you,\n    not able to heal your sores.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,\n    like a great lion to Judah.\n\
      I will tear them to pieces and go away;\n    I will carry them off, with no\
      \ one to rescue them.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ Then I will return to my lair\n    until they have borne their guilt\n\
      \    and seek my face—\nin their misery\n    they will earnestly seek me.”"
  6:
    1: "“Come, let us return to the Lord.\nHe has torn us to pieces\n    but he will\
      \ heal us;\nhe has injured us\n    but he will bind up our wounds.\n"
    2: "² After two days he will revive us;\n    on the third day he will restore\
      \ us,\n    that we may live in his presence.\n"
    3: "³ Let us acknowledge the Lord;\n    let us press on to acknowledge him.\n\
      As surely as the sun rises,\n    he will appear;\nhe will come to us like the\
      \ winter rains,\n    like the spring rains that water the earth.” \n"
    4: "⁴ “What can I do with you, Ephraim?\n    What can I do with you, Judah?\n\
      Your love is like the morning mist,\n    like the early dew that disappears.\n"
    5: "⁵ Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets,\n    I killed you with the\
      \ words of my mouth—\n    then my judgments go forth like the sun.\n"
    6: "⁶ For I desire mercy, not sacrifice,\n    and acknowledgment of God rather\
      \ than burnt offerings.\n"
    7: "⁷ As at Adam, they have broken the covenant;\n    they were unfaithful to\
      \ me there.\n"
    8: "⁸ Gilead is a city of evildoers,\n    stained with footprints of blood.\n"
    9: "⁹ As marauders lie in ambush for a victim,\n    so do bands of priests;\n\
      they murder on the road to Shechem,\n    carrying out their wicked schemes.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ I have seen a horrible thing in Israel:\n    There Ephraim is given to\
      \ prostitution,\n    Israel is defiled. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Also for you, Judah,\n    a harvest is appointed.\n“Whenever I would\
      \ restore the fortunes of my people,"
  7:
    1: "¹ whenever I would heal Israel,\nthe sins of Ephraim are exposed\n    and\
      \ the crimes of Samaria revealed.\nThey practice deceit,\n    thieves break\
      \ into houses,\n    bandits rob in the streets;\n"
    2: "² but they do not realize\n    that I remember all their evil deeds.\nTheir\
      \ sins engulf them;\n    they are always before me. \n"
    3: "³ “They delight the king with their wickedness,\n    the princes with their\
      \ lies.\n"
    4: "⁴ They are all adulterers,\n    burning like an oven\nwhose fire the baker\
      \ need not stir\n    from the kneading of the dough till it rises.\n"
    5: "⁵ On the day of the festival of our king\n    the princes become inflamed\
      \ with wine,\n    and he joins hands with the mockers.\n"
    6: "⁶ Their hearts are like an oven;\n    they approach him with intrigue.\nTheir\
      \ passion smolders all night;\n    in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.\n"
    7: "⁷ All of them are hot as an oven;\n    they devour their rulers.\nAll their\
      \ kings fall,\n    and none of them calls on me. \n"
    8: "⁸ “Ephraim mixes with the nations;\n    Ephraim is a flat loaf not turned\
      \ over.\n"
    9: "⁹ Foreigners sap his strength,\n    but he does not realize it.\nHis hair\
      \ is sprinkled with gray,\n    but he does not notice.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Israel’s arrogance testifies against him,\n    but despite all this\n\
      he does not return to the Lord his God\n    or search for him. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Ephraim is like a dove,\n    easily deceived and senseless—\nnow calling\
      \ to Egypt,\n    now turning to Assyria.\n"
    12: "¹² When they go, I will throw my net over them;\n    I will pull them down\
      \ like the birds in the sky.\nWhen I hear them flocking together,\n    I will\
      \ catch them.\n"
    13: "¹³ Woe to them,\n    because they have strayed from me!\nDestruction to them,\n\
      \    because they have rebelled against me!\nI long to redeem them\n    but\
      \ they speak about me falsely.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ They do not cry out to me from their hearts\n    but wail on their beds.\n\
      They slash themselves, appealing to their gods\n    for grain and new wine,\n\
      \    but they turn away from me.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ I trained them and strengthened their arms,\n    but they plot evil against\
      \ me.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ They do not turn to the Most High;\n    they are like a faulty bow.\n\
      Their leaders will fall by the sword\n    because of their insolent words.\n\
      For this they will be ridiculed\n    in the land of Egypt."
  8:
    1: "“Put the trumpet to your lips!\n    An eagle is over the house of the Lord\n\

    2: "² Israel cries out to me,\n    ‘Our God, we acknowledge you!’\n"
    3: "³ But Israel has rejected what is good;\n    an enemy will pursue him.\n"
    4: "⁴ They set up kings without my consent;\n    they choose princes without my\
      \ approval.\nWith their silver and gold\n    they make idols for themselves\n\
      \    to their own destruction.\n"
    5: "⁵ Samaria, throw out your calf-idol!\n    My anger burns against them.\nHow\
      \ long will they be incapable of purity?\n"
    6: "⁶     They are from Israel!\nThis calf—a metalworker has made it;\n    it\
      \ is not God.\nIt will be broken in pieces,\n    that calf of Samaria. \n"
    7: "⁷ “They sow the wind\n    and reap the whirlwind.\nThe stalk has no head;\n\
      \    it will produce no flour.\nWere it to yield grain,\n    foreigners would\
      \ swallow it up.\n"
    8: "⁸ Israel is swallowed up;\n    now she is among the nations\n    like something\
      \ no one wants.\n"
    9: "⁹ For they have gone up to Assyria\n    like a wild donkey wandering alone.\n\
      \    Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Although they have sold themselves among the nations,\n    I will now\
      \ gather them together.\nThey will begin to waste away\n    under the oppression\
      \ of the mighty king. \n"
    11: "¹¹ “Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings,\n    these have become\
      \ altars for sinning.\n"
    12: "¹² I wrote for them the many things of my law,\n    but they regarded them\
      \ as something foreign.\n"
    13: "¹³ Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to me,\n    and though they eat\
      \ the meat,\n    the Lord is not pleased with them.\nNow he will remember their\
      \ wickedness\n    and punish their sins:\n    They will return to Egypt.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Israel has forgotten their Maker\n    and built palaces;\n    Judah has\
      \ fortified many towns.\nBut I will send fire on their cities\n    that will\
      \ consume their fortresses.”"
  9:
    1: "Do not rejoice, Israel;\n    do not be jubilant like the other nations.\n\
      For you have been unfaithful to your God;\n    you love the wages of a prostitute\n\
      \    at every threshing floor.\n"
    2: "² Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people;\n    the new\
      \ wine will fail them.\n"
    3: "³ They will not remain in the Lord’s land;\n    Ephraim will return to Egypt\n\
      \    and eat unclean food in Assyria.\n"
    4: "⁴ They will not pour out wine offerings to the Lord,\n    nor will their sacrifices\
      \ please him.\nSuch sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;\n\
      \    all who eat them will be unclean.\nThis food will be for themselves;\n\
      \    it will not come into the temple of the Lord. \n"
    5: "⁵ What will you do on the day of your appointed festivals,\n    on the feast\
      \ days of the Lord?\n"
    6: "⁶ Even if they escape from destruction,\n    Egypt will gather them,\n   \
      \ and Memphis will bury them.\nTheir treasures of silver will be taken over\
      \ by briers,\n    and thorns will overrun their tents.\n"
    7: "⁷ The days of punishment are coming,\n    the days of reckoning are at hand.\n\
      \    Let Israel know this.\nBecause your sins are so many\n    and your hostility\
      \ so great,\nthe prophet is considered a fool,\n    the inspired person a maniac.\n"
    8: "⁸ The prophet, along with my God,\n    is the watchman over Ephraim,\nyet\
      \ snares await him on all his paths,\n    and hostility in the house of his\
      \ God.\n"
    9: "⁹ They have sunk deep into corruption,\n    as in the days of Gibeah.\nGod\
      \ will remember their wickedness\n    and punish them for their sins. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “When I found Israel,\n    it was like finding grapes in the desert;\n\
      when I saw your ancestors,\n    it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig\
      \ tree.\nBut when they came to Baal Peor,\n    they consecrated themselves to\
      \ that shameful idol\n    and became as vile as the thing they loved.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird—\n    no birth, no pregnancy,\

    12: "¹² Even if they rear children,\n    I will bereave them of every one.\nWoe\
      \ to them\n    when I turn away from them!\n"
    13: "¹³ I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre,\n    planted in a pleasant place.\nBut\
      \ Ephraim will bring out\n    their children to the slayer.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Give them, Lord—\n    what will you give them?\nGive them wombs that miscarry\n\
      \    and breasts that are dry. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal,\n    I hated them there.\n\

    5: "⁵ The people who live in Samaria fear\n    for the calf-idol of Beth Aven.\n\
      Its people will mourn over it,\n    and so will its idolatrous priests,\nthose\

      \ exile.\n"
    6: "⁶ It will be carried to Assyria\n    as tribute for the great king.\nEphraim\

  12:
    1: "¹ Ephraim feeds on the wind;\n    he pursues the east wind all day\n    and\

      \ he became guilty of Baal worship and died.\n"
    2: "² Now they sin more and more;\n    they make idols for themselves from their\
      \ silver,\ncleverly fashioned images,\n    all of them the work of craftsmen.\n\

    3: "³ Assyria cannot save us;\n    we will not mount warhorses.\nWe will never\
