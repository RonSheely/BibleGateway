      These were the gatekeepers belonging to the camp of the Levites. '
    19: '¹⁹ Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his fellow
      gatekeepers from his family (the Korahites) were responsible for guarding the
      thresholds of the tent just as their ancestors had been responsible for guarding
      the entrance to the dwelling of the Lord. '
    20: '²⁰ In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar was the official in charge of
      the gatekeepers, and the Lord was with him. '
    21: "²¹ Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the\
      \ tent of meeting. \n"
    22: '²² Altogether, those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds numbered
      212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. The gatekeepers had
      been assigned to their positions of trust by David and Samuel the seer. '
    23: '²³ They and their descendants were in charge of guarding the gates of the
      house of the Lord—the house called the tent of meeting. '
    24: '²⁴ The gatekeepers were on the four sides: east, west, north and south. '
    25: '²⁵ Their fellow Levites in their villages had to come from time to time and
      share their duties for seven-day periods. '
    26: '²⁶ But the four principal gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with
      the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God. '
    27: "²⁷ They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because\
      \ they had to guard it; and they had charge of the key for opening it each morning.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ Some of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service;
      they counted them when they were brought in and when they were taken out. '
    29: '²⁹ Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the other
      articles of the sanctuary, as well as the special flour and wine, and the olive
      oil, incense and spices. '
    30: '³⁰ But some of the priests took care of mixing the spices. '
    31: '³¹ A Levite named Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite,
      was entrusted with the responsibility for baking the offering bread. '
    32: "³² Some of the Kohathites, their fellow Levites, were in charge of preparing\
      \ for every Sabbath the bread set out on the table. \n"
    33: "³³ Those who were musicians, heads of Levite families, stayed in the rooms\
      \ of the temple and were exempt from other duties because they were responsible\
      \ for the work day and night. \n"
    34: "³⁴ All these were heads of Levite families, chiefs as listed in their genealogy,\

    35: "³⁵ Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon.\nHis wife’s name was Maakah, "

  10:
    1: '¹ Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them,
      and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. '
    2: '² The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed
      his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. '
    3: "³ The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him,\
      \ they wounded him. \n"
    4: "⁴ Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these\
      \ uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me.”\nBut his armor-bearer was terrified\
      \ and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. "
    5: '⁵ When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and
      died. '
    6: "⁶ So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together. \n"
    7: "⁷ When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that\
      \ Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines\
      \ came and occupied them. \n"
    8: '⁸ The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul
      and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. '
    9: '⁹ They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout
      the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their
      people. '
    10: "¹⁰ They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in\
      \ the temple of Dagon. \n"
    11: '¹¹ When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had
      done to Saul, '
    12: "¹² all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and\
      \ brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree\
      \ in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days. \n"
    13: '¹³ Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord; he did not keep the word
      of the Lord and even consulted a medium for guidance, '
    14: ¹⁴ and did not inquire of the Lord. So the Lord put him to death and turned
      the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
  11:
    1: '¹ All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh
      and blood. '
    2: "² In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on\
      \ their military campaigns. And the Lord your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd\
      \ my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’” \n"
    3: "³ When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made\
      \ a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king\
      \ over Israel, as the Lord had promised through Samuel. \n"
    4: '⁴ David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The
      Jebusites who lived there '
    5: "⁵ said to David, “You will not get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured\
      \ the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David. \n"
    6: "⁶ David had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.”\
      \ Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command. \n"
    7: '⁷ David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City
      of David. '
    8: '⁸ He built up the city around it, from the terraces to the surrounding wall,
      while Joab restored the rest of the city. '
    9: "⁹ And David became more and more powerful, because the Lord Almighty was with\
      \ him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ These were the chiefs of David’s mighty warriors—they, together with all
      Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as
      the Lord had promised— '
    11: "¹¹ this is the list of David’s mighty warriors:\nJashobeam, a Hakmonite,\
      \ was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men,\
      \ whom he killed in one encounter. \n"
    12: '¹² Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty
      warriors. '
    13: '¹³ He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for
      battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from
      the Philistines. '
    14: "¹⁴ But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it\
      \ and struck the Philistines down, and the Lord brought about a great victory.\
      \ \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave
      of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. '
    16: '¹⁶ At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison
      was at Bethlehem. '
    17: '¹⁷ David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink
      of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” '
    18: '¹⁸ So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well
      near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink
      it; instead, he poured it out to the Lord. '
    19: "¹⁹ “God forbid that I should do this!” he said. “Should I drink the blood\
      \ of these men who went at the risk of their lives?” Because they risked their\
      \ lives to bring it back, David would not drink it.\nSuch were the exploits\
      \ of the three mighty warriors. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear
      against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the
      Three. '
    21: "²¹ He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even\
      \ though he was not included among them. \n"
    22: '²² Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great
      exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into
      a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. '
    23: '²³ And he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits tall. Although the
      Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him
      with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with
      his own spear. '
    24: '²⁴ Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous
      as the three mighty warriors. '
    25: "²⁵ He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included\
      \ among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. \n"
    26: "²⁶ The mighty warriors were:\nAsahel the brother of Joab,\nElhanan son of\
      \ Dodo from Bethlehem, \n"

    1: '¹ These were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was banished from

    9: "⁹ Ezer was the chief,\nObadiah the second in command, Eliab the third, \n"
    10: "¹⁰ Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, \n"

    14: '¹⁴ These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred,

    15: "¹⁵ It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing\

      \ east and to the west. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold. '
    17: "¹⁷ David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me\
      \ in peace to help me, I am ready for you to join me. But if you have come to\

    19: '¹⁹ Some of the tribe of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the

      \ armed with every type of weapon—120,000. \n"
    38: '³⁸ All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They
      came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the
      rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king. '
    39: '³⁹ The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their
      families had supplied provisions for them. '
    40: ⁴⁰ Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali
      came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful
      supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep,
      for there was joy in Israel.
  13:
    1: '¹ David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and
      commanders of hundreds. '
    2: '² He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and
      if it is the will of the Lord our God, let us send word far and wide to the
      rest of our people throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests
      and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join
      us. '
    3: '³ Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it
      during the reign of Saul.” '
    4: "⁴ The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the\
      \ people. \n"
    5: '⁵ So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath,
      to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. '
    6: "⁶ David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up\
      \ from there the ark of God the Lord, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the\
      \ ark that is called by the Name. \n"
    7: '⁷ They moved the ark of God from Abinadab’s house on a new cart, with Uzzah
      and Ahio guiding it. '
    8: "⁸ David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before\
      \ God, with songs and with harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets. \n"
    9: '⁹ When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand
      to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled. '
    10: "¹⁰ The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because\
      \ he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Then David was angry because the Lord’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah,\
      \ and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. \n"
    12: '¹² David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How can I ever bring the
      ark of God to me?” '
    13: '¹³ He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead,
      he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. '
    14: ¹⁴ The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three
      months, and the Lord blessed his household and everything he had.
  14:
    1: '¹ Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs,
      stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him. '
    2: "² And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and\
      \ that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and
      daughters. '
    4: '⁴ These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab,
      Nathan, Solomon, '
    5: '⁵ Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, '
    6: '⁶ Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, '
    7: "⁷ Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet. \n"
    8: '⁸ When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel,
      they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went
      out to meet them. '
    9: '⁹ Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim; '
    10: "¹⁰ so David inquired of God: “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will\
      \ you deliver them into my hands?”\nThe Lord answered him, “Go, I will deliver\
      \ them into your hands.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them.
      He said, “As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.”
      So that place was called Baal Perazim. '
    12: "¹² The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders\
      \ to burn them in the fire. \n"
    13: '¹³ Once more the Philistines raided the valley; '
    14: '¹⁴ so David inquired of God again, and God answered him, “Do not go directly
      after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. '
    15: '¹⁵ As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees,
      move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you
      to strike the Philistine army.” '
    16: "¹⁶ So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine\
      \ army, all the way from Gibeon to Gezer. \n"
    17: ¹⁷ So David’s fame spread throughout every land, and the Lord made all the
      nations fear him.
  15:
    1: '¹ After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David,
      he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. '
    2: "² Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because\
      \ the Lord chose them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister before him\
      \ forever.” \n"
    3: '³ David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord
      to the place he had prepared for it. '
    4: "⁴ He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: \n"
    5: "⁵ From the descendants of Kohath,\nUriel the leader and 120 relatives; \n"
    6: "⁶ from the descendants of Merari,\nAsaiah the leader and 220 relatives; \n"
    7: "⁷ from the descendants of Gershon,\nJoel the leader and 130 relatives; \n"
    8: "⁸ from the descendants of Elizaphan,\nShemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ from the descendants of Hebron,\nEliel the leader and 80 relatives; \n"
    10: "¹⁰ from the descendants of Uzziel,\nAmminadab the leader and 112 relatives.\
      \ \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah,
      Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites. '
    12: '¹² He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and
      your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the
      Lord, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it. '
    13: '¹³ It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that
      the Lord our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about
      how to do it in the prescribed way.” '
    14: '¹⁴ So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up
      the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    15: "¹⁵ And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders,\
      \ as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the Lord. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their fellow Levites\
      \ as musicians to make a joyful sound with musical instruments: lyres, harps\
      \ and cymbals. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph
      son of Berekiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah; '
    18: "¹⁸ and with them their relatives next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth,\
      \ Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah,\
      \ Obed-Edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; '
    20: '²⁰ Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah
      were to play the lyres according to alamoth, '
    21: '²¹ and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were
      to play the harps, directing according to sheminith. '
    22: "²² Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility\
      \ because he was skillful at it. \n"
    23: '²³ Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark. '
    24: "²⁴ Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer\
      \ the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah\
      \ were also to be doorkeepers for the ark. \n"
    25: '²⁵ So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand
      went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-Edom,
      with rejoicing. '
    26: '²⁶ Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed. '
    27: '²⁷ Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites
      who were carrying the ark, and as were the musicians, and Kenaniah, who was
      in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod. '
    28: "²⁸ So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouts,\
      \ with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing\
      \ of lyres and harps. \n"
    29: ²⁹ As the ark of the covenant of the Lord was entering the City of David,
      Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing
      and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.
  16:
    1: '¹ They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched
      for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. '
    2: '² After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship
      offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. '
    3: "³ Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each\
      \ Israelite man and woman. \n"
    4: '⁴ He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord,
      to extol, thank, and praise the Lord, the God of Israel: '
    5: '⁵ Asaph was the chief, and next to him in rank were Zechariah, then Jaaziel,
      Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel. They were
      to play the lyres and harps, Asaph was to sound the cymbals, '
    6: "⁶ and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly\
      \ before the ark of the covenant of God. \n"
    7: "⁷ That day David first appointed Asaph and his associates to give praise to\
      \ the Lord in this manner: \n"
    8: "⁸ Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name;\n    make known among the nations\
      \ what he has done.\n"
    9: "⁹ Sing to him, sing praise to him;\n    tell of all his wonderful acts.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Glory in his holy name;\n    let the hearts of those who seek the Lord\
      \ rejoice.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Look to the Lord and his strength;\n    seek his face always. \n"
    12: "¹² Remember the wonders he has done,\n    his miracles, and the judgments\
      \ he pronounced,\n"
    13: "¹³ you his servants, the descendants of Israel,\n    his chosen ones, the\
      \ children of Jacob.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ He is the Lord our God;\n    his judgments are in all the earth. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ He remembers his covenant forever,\n    the promise he made, for a thousand\
      \ generations,\n"
    16: "¹⁶ the covenant he made with Abraham,\n    the oath he swore to Isaac.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,\n    to Israel as an everlasting\
      \ covenant:\n"
    18: "¹⁸ “To you I will give the land of Canaan\n    as the portion you will inherit.”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ When they were but few in number,\n    few indeed, and strangers in it,\n"
    20: "²⁰ they wandered from nation to nation,\n    from one kingdom to another.\n"
    21: "²¹ He allowed no one to oppress them;\n    for their sake he rebuked kings:\n"
    22: "²² “Do not touch my anointed ones;\n    do my prophets no harm.” \n"
    23: "²³ Sing to the Lord, all the earth;\n    proclaim his salvation day after\
      \ day.\n"
    24: "²⁴ Declare his glory among the nations,\n    his marvelous deeds among all\
      \ peoples. \n"
    25: "²⁵ For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise;\n    he is to be feared\
      \ above all gods.\n"
    26: "²⁶ For all the gods of the nations are idols,\n    but the Lord made the\
      \ heavens.\n"
    27: "²⁷ Splendor and majesty are before him;\n    strength and joy are in his\
      \ dwelling place. \n"
    28: "²⁸ Ascribe to the Lord, all you families of nations,\n    ascribe to the\
      \ Lord glory and strength.\n"
    29: "²⁹ Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;\n    bring an offering and\
      \ come before him.\nWorship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.\n"
    30: "³⁰     Tremble before him, all the earth!\n    The world is firmly established;\
      \ it cannot be moved. \n"
    31: "³¹ Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad;\n    let them say among\
      \ the nations, “The Lord reigns!”\n"
    32: "³² Let the sea resound, and all that is in it;\n    let the fields be jubilant,\
      \ and everything in them!\n"
    33: "³³ Let the trees of the forest sing,\n    let them sing for joy before the\
      \ Lord,\n    for he comes to judge the earth. \n"
    34: "³⁴ Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;\n    his love endures forever.\n"
    35: "³⁵ Cry out, “Save us, God our Savior;\n    gather us and deliver us from\
      \ the nations,\nthat we may give thanks to your holy name,\n    and glory in\
      \ your praise.”\n"
    36: "³⁶ Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    from everlasting to everlasting.\n\
      Then all the people said “Amen” and “Praise the Lord.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of
      the Lord to minister there regularly, according to each day’s requirements. '
    38: "³⁸ He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with\
      \ them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers. \n"
    39: '³⁹ David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle
      of the Lord at the high place in Gibeon '
    40: '⁴⁰ to present burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering
      regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the
      Law of the Lord, which he had given Israel. '
    41: '⁴¹ With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated
      by name to give thanks to the Lord, “for his love endures forever.” '
    42: "⁴² Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and\
      \ cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The\
      \ sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate. \n"
    43: ⁴³ Then all the people left, each for their own home, and David returned home
      to bless his family.
  17:
    1: "¹ After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here\
      \ I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the Lord\
      \ is under a tent.” \n"
    2: "² Nathan replied to David, “Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with\
      \ you.” \n"
    3: "³ But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: \n"
    4: '⁴ “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: You are not
      the one to build me a house to dwell in. '
    5: '⁵ I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt
      to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place
      to another. '
    6: "⁶ Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of\
      \ their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people, “Why have you not built\
      \ me a house of cedar?”’ \n"
    7: '⁷ “Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says:
      I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler
      over my people Israel. '
    8: '⁸ I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your
      enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest
      men on earth. '
    9: '⁹ And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that
      they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people
      will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning '
    10: "¹⁰ and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel.\
      \ I will also subdue all your enemies.\n“‘I declare to you that the Lord will\
      \ build a house for you: "
    11: '¹¹ When your days are over and you go to be with your ancestors, I will raise
      up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish
      his kingdom. '
    12: '¹² He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his
      throne forever. '
    13: '¹³ I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love
      away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor. '
    14: "¹⁴ I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be\
      \ established forever.’” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and he said:\n“Who am\
      \ I, Lord God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? "
    17: "¹⁷ And as if this were not enough in your sight, my God, you have spoken\

    18: '¹⁸ “What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know
      your servant, '
    19: "¹⁹ Lord. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have\
      \ done this great thing and made known all these great promises. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “There is no one like you, Lord, and there is no God but you, as we have
      heard with our own ears. '
    21: '²¹ And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth whose God went
      out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to
      perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people,
      whom you redeemed from Egypt? '
    22: "²² You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, Lord, have\
      \ become their God. \n"
    23: '²³ “And now, Lord, let the promise you have made concerning your servant
      and his house be established forever. Do as you promised, '
    24: "²⁴ so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever.\
      \ Then people will say, ‘The Lord Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel’s\
      \ God!’ And the house of your servant David will be established before you.\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house
      for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you. '
    26: '²⁶ You, Lord, are God! You have promised these good things to your servant. '
    27: ²⁷ Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may
      continue forever in your sight; for you, Lord, have blessed it, and it will
      be blessed forever.”
  18:
    1: "¹ In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them,\
      \ and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines.\
      \ \n"
    2: "² David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to him and brought\
      \ him tribute. \n"
    3: '³ Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, in the vicinity of Hamath,
      when he went to set up his monument at the Euphrates River. '
    4: "⁴ David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and\
      \ twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot\
      \ horses. \n"
    5: '⁵ When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David
      struck down twenty-two thousand of them. '
    6: "⁶ He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became\
      \ subject to him and brought him tribute. The Lord gave David victory wherever\
      \ he went. \n"
    7: '⁷ David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought
      them to Jerusalem. '
    8: "⁸ From Tebah and Kun, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, David took a great\
      \ quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze Sea, the pillars\
      \ and various bronze articles. \n"
    9: '⁹ When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of
      Hadadezer king of Zobah, '
    10: "¹⁰ he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him\
      \ on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram\
      \ brought all kinds of articles of gold, of silver and of bronze. \n"
    11: "¹¹ King David dedicated these articles to the Lord, as he had done with the\
      \ silver and gold he had taken from all these nations: Edom and Moab, the Ammonites\
      \ and the Philistines, and Amalek. \n"
    12: '¹² Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley
      of Salt. '
    13: "¹³ He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David.\
      \ The Lord gave David victory wherever he went. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his
      people. '
    15: '¹⁵ Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; '
    16: '¹⁶ Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha
      was secretary; '
    17: ¹⁷ Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s
      sons were chief officials at the king’s side.
  19:
    1: '¹ In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded
      him as king. '
    2: "² David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his\
      \ father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy\
      \ to Hanun concerning his father.\nWhen David’s envoys came to Hanun in the\
      \ land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him, "
    3: '³ the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your
      father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Haven’t his envoys come
      to you only to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?” '
    4: "⁴ So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved them, cut off their garments at the\
      \ buttocks, and sent them away. \n"
    5: "⁵ When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet\
      \ them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till\
      \ your beards have grown, and then come back.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, Hanun
      and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers
      from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maakah and Zobah. '
    7: "⁷ They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the\
      \ king of Maakah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the\
      \ Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle. \n"
    8: '⁸ On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men. '
    9: "⁹ The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to\
      \ their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.\
      \ \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him;
      so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the
      Arameans. '
    11: '¹¹ He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and
      they were deployed against the Ammonites. '
    12: '¹² Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue
      me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you. '
    13: "¹³ Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our\

    14: '¹⁴ Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and
      they fled before him. '
    15: "¹⁵ When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled\
      \ before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to\
      \ Jerusalem. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent\
      \ messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with\
      \ Shophak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan;
      he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed
      his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him. '
    18: "¹⁸ But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their\
      \ charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophak\
      \ the commander of their army. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel,\
      \ they made peace with David and became subject to him.\nSo the Arameans were\
      \ not willing to help the Ammonites anymore."
  20:
    1: '¹ In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed
      forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged
      it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins. '
    2: '² David took the crown from the head of their king—its weight was found to
      be a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones—and it was placed on
      David’s head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city '
    3: "³ and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with\
      \ saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns.\
      \ Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem. \n"
    4: "⁴ In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At\
      \ that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of\
      \ the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated. \n"
    5: "⁵ In another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi\
      \ the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver’s\
      \ rod. \n"
    6: '⁶ In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man
      with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all.
      He also was descended from Rapha. '
    7: "⁷ When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed\
      \ him. \n"
    8: ⁸ These were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David
      and his men.
  21:
    1: '¹ Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. '
    2: "² So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the\
      \ Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know\
      \ how many there are.” \n"
    3: "³ But Joab replied, “May the Lord multiply his troops a hundred times over.\
      \ My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s subjects? Why does my lord want\
      \ to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?” \n"
    4: '⁴ The king’s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout
      Israel and then came back to Jerusalem. '
    5: "⁵ Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there\
      \ were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including\
      \ four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah. \n"
    6: '⁶ But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the
      king’s command was repulsive to him. '
    7: "⁷ This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel. \n"
    8: "⁸ Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg\
      \ you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”\
      \ \n"
    9: '⁹ The Lord said to Gad, David’s seer, '
    10: "¹⁰ “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am giving you three\
      \ options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Take
      your choice: '
    12: "¹² three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies,\
      \ with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the Lord—days\
      \ of plague in the land, with the angel of the Lord ravaging every part of Israel.’\
      \ Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me.” \n"
    13: "¹³ David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands\
      \ of the Lord, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into human\
      \ hands.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ So the Lord sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel
      fell dead. '
    15: "¹⁵ And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing\
      \ so, the Lord saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel\
      \ who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of\
      \ the Lord was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\
      \ \n"
    16: "¹⁶ David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven\
      \ and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David\
      \ and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ David said to God, “Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted?\
      \ I, the shepherd, have sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have\
      \ they done? Lord my God, let your hand fall on me and my family, but do not\
      \ let this plague remain on your people.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build
      an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. '
    19: "¹⁹ So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name\
      \ of the Lord. \n"
    20: '²⁰ While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four
      sons who were with him hid themselves. '
    21: "²¹ Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the\
      \ threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground. \n"
    22: "²² David said to him, “Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I\
      \ can build an altar to the Lord, that the plague on the people may be stopped.\
      \ Sell it to me at the full price.” \n"
    23: "²³ Araunah said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases\
      \ him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges\
      \ for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.”\
      \ \n"
    24: "²⁴ But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying the full price.\
      \ I will not take for the Lord what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering\
      \ that costs me nothing.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site. '
    26: "²⁶ David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings\
      \ and fellowship offerings. He called on the Lord, and the Lord answered him\
      \ with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Then the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. '
    28: '²⁸ At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing
      floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there. '
    29: '²⁹ The tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and
      the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon. '
    30: ³⁰ But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid
      of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
  22:
    1: "¹ Then David said, “The house of the Lord God is to be here, and also the\
      \ altar of burnt offering for Israel.” \n"
    2: '² So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners residing in Israel, and
      from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building
      the house of God. '
    3: '³ He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways
      and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed. '
    4: "⁴ He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians\
      \ and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David. \n"
    5: "⁵ David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to\
      \ be built for the Lord should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor\
      \ in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it.”\
      \ So David made extensive preparations before his death. \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for
      the Lord, the God of Israel. '
    7: '⁷ David said to Solomon: “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for
      the Name of the Lord my God. '
    8: '⁸ But this word of the Lord came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and have
      fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have
      shed much blood on the earth in my sight. '
    9: '⁹ But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will
      give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon,
      and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign. '
    10: "¹⁰ He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and\
      \ I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over\
      \ Israel forever.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Now, my son, the Lord be with you, and may you have success and build
      the house of the Lord your God, as he said you would. '
    12: '¹² May the Lord give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in
      command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God. '
    13: "¹³ Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and\
      \ laws that the Lord gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not\
      \ be afraid or discouraged. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the Lord a hundred
      thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, quantities of bronze
      and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them. '
    15: '¹⁵ You have many workers: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as
      those skilled in every kind of work '
    16: "¹⁶ in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin\
      \ the work, and the Lord be with you.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. '
    18: '¹⁸ He said to them, “Is not the Lord your God with you? And has he not granted
      you rest on every side? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my
      hands, and the land is subject to the Lord and to his people. '
    19: ¹⁹ Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the Lord your God. Begin to build
      the sanctuary of the Lord God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant
      of the Lord and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will
      be built for the Name of the Lord.”
  23:
    1: "¹ When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over\
      \ Israel. \n"
    2: '² He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests
      and Levites. '
    3: '³ The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number
      of men was thirty-eight thousand. '
    4: '⁴ David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work
      of the temple of the Lord and six thousand are to be officials and judges. '
    5: "⁵ Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the\
      \ Lord with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose.” \n"
    6: "⁶ David separated the Levites into divisions corresponding to the sons of\
      \ Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. \n"
    7: "⁷ Belonging to the Gershonites:\nLadan and Shimei. \n"
    8: "⁸ The sons of Ladan:\nJehiel the first, Zetham and Joel—three in all. \n"
    9: "⁹ The sons of Shimei:\nShelomoth, Haziel and Haran—three in all.\nThese were\
      \ the heads of the families of Ladan. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ And the sons of Shimei:\nJahath, Ziza, Jeush and Beriah.\nThese were the\
      \ sons of Shimei—four in all. \n"
    11: "¹¹ Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not\
      \ have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment. \n"
    12: "¹² The sons of Kohath:\nAmram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel—four in all. \n"
    13: "¹³ The sons of Amram:\nAaron and Moses.\nAaron was set apart, he and his\
      \ descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices\
      \ before the Lord, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his\
      \ name forever. "
    14: "¹⁴ The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of\
      \ Levi. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ The sons of Moses:\nGershom and Eliezer. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ The descendants of Gershom:\nShubael was the first. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The descendants of Eliezer:\nRehabiah was the first.\nEliezer had no other\
      \ sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ The sons of Izhar:\nShelomith was the first. \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The sons of Hebron:\nJeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the\
      \ third and Jekameam the fourth. \n"
    20: "²⁰ The sons of Uzziel:\nMicah the first and Ishiah the second. \n"
    21: "²¹ The sons of Merari:\nMahli and Mushi.\nThe sons of Mahli:\nEleazar and\
      \ Kish. \n"
    22: "²² Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins,\
      \ the sons of Kish, married them. \n"
    23: "²³ The sons of Mushi:\nMahli, Eder and Jerimoth—three in all. \n"
    24: '²⁴ These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families
      as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is,
      the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the Lord. '
    25: '²⁵ For David had said, “Since the Lord, the God of Israel, has granted rest
      to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever, '
    26: '²⁶ the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles
      used in its service.” '
    27: "²⁷ According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted\
      \ from those twenty years old or more. \n"
    28: '²⁸ The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service
      of the temple of the Lord: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms,
      the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at
      the house of God. '
    29: '²⁹ They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the special flour
      for the grain offerings, the thin loaves made without yeast, the baking and
      the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. '
    30: '³⁰ They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord. They
      were to do the same in the evening '
    31: "³¹ and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the Lord on the Sabbaths,\
      \ at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals. They were to serve\
      \ before the Lord regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for\
      \ them. \n"
    32: ³² And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting,
      for the Holy Place and, under their relatives the descendants of Aaron, for
      the service of the temple of the Lord.
  24:
    1: "¹ These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron:\nThe sons of Aaron\
      \ were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. "
    2: '² But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons;
      so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. '
    3: '³ With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelek a descendant
      of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of
      ministering. '
    4: '⁴ A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than among
      Ithamar’s, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from
      Eleazar’s descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar’s descendants. '
    5: "⁵ They divided them impartially by casting lots, for there were officials\
      \ of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar\
      \ and Ithamar. \n"
    6: "⁶ The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the\
      \ presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelek son\
      \ of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites—one\
      \ family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar. \n"
    7: "⁷ The first lot fell to Jehoiarib,\nthe second to Jedaiah, \n"
    8: "⁸ the third to Harim,\nthe fourth to Seorim, \n"
    9: "⁹ the fifth to Malkijah,\nthe sixth to Mijamin, \n"

    19: "¹⁹ This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple\
      \ of the Lord, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their ancestor\
      \ Aaron, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him. \n"
    20: "²⁰ As for the rest of the descendants of Levi:\nfrom the sons of Amram: Shubael;\n\
      from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah. \n"
    21: "²¹ As for Rehabiah, from his sons:\nIshiah was the first. \n"
    22: "²² From the Izharites: Shelomoth;\nfrom the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath. \n"
    23: "²³ The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the\
      \ third and Jekameam the fourth. \n"
    24: "²⁴ The son of Uzziel: Micah;\nfrom the sons of Micah: Shamir. \n"
    25: "²⁵ The brother of Micah: Ishiah;\nfrom the sons of Ishiah: Zechariah. \n"
    26: "²⁶ The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.\nThe son of Jaaziah: Beno. \n"
    27: "²⁷ The sons of Merari:\nfrom Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zakkur and Ibri. \n"
    28: "²⁸ From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. \n"
    29: "²⁹ From Kish: the son of Kish:\nJerahmeel. \n"
    30: "³⁰ And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth.\nThese were the Levites,\
      \ according to their families. "
    31: ³¹ They also cast lots, just as their relatives the descendants of Aaron did,
      in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelek, and the heads of families
      of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated
      the same as those of the youngest.
  25:
    1: "¹ David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons\
      \ of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied\
      \ by harps, lyres and cymbals. Here is the list of the men who performed this\
      \ service: \n"
    2: "² From the sons of Asaph:\nZakkur, Joseph, Nethaniah and Asarelah. The sons\

    5: "⁵ (All these were sons of Heman the king’s seer. They were given him through\

    7: '⁷ Along with their relatives—all of them trained and skilled in music for

    8: '⁸ Young and old alike, teacher as well as student, cast lots for their duties. '

    9: '⁹ “And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve

      you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service
      of the temple of the Lord is finished. '
    21: ²¹ The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on

  29:
    1: '¹ Then King David said to the whole assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom
      God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this
      palatial structure is not for man but for the Lord God. '
    2: '² With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God—gold for
      the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron
      and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of
      various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble—all of these in large
      quantities. '
    3: '³ Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures
      of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have
      provided for this holy temple: '
    4: '⁴ three thousand talents of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents
      of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings, '
    5: "⁵ for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by\
      \ the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate themselves to the Lord today?”\
      \ \n"
    6: '⁶ Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the
      commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge
      of the king’s work gave willingly. '
    7: '⁷ They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and
      ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand
      talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron. '
    8: '⁸ Anyone who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of
      the Lord in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite. '
    9: "⁹ The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had\
      \ given freely and wholeheartedly to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced\
      \ greatly. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly, saying,\n\
      “Praise be to you, Lord,\n    the God of our father Israel,\n    from everlasting\
      \ to everlasting.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power\n    and the glory and the\
      \ majesty and the splendor,\n    for everything in heaven and earth is yours.\n\
      Yours, Lord, is the kingdom;\n    you are exalted as head over all.\n"
    12: "¹² Wealth and honor come from you;\n    you are the ruler of all things.\n\
      In your hands are strength and power\n    to exalt and give strength to all.\n"

    14: '¹⁴ “But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as

      comes from your hand. '
    15: '¹⁵ We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors.
      Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. '
    16: '¹⁶ Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you
      a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. '
    17: '¹⁷ I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity.
      All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have
      seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you. '
    18: '¹⁸ Lord, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep these desires
      and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal
      to you. '
    19: "¹⁹ And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands,\
      \ statutes and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure\

    20: "²⁰ Then David said to the whole assembly, “Praise the Lord your God.” So\

      \ themselves before the Lord and the king. \n"
    21: '²¹ The next day they made sacrifices to the Lord and presented burnt offerings
      to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together
      with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. '
    22: "²² They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the Lord that day.\n\
      Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing\
      \ him before the Lord to be ruler and Zadok to be priest. "
    23: '²³ So Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king in place of his father
      David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him. '
    24: "²⁴ All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged\

    25: "²⁵ The Lord highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed\

    27: '²⁷ He ruled over Israel forty years—seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. '
    28: "²⁸ He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor.\
      \ His son Solomon succeeded him as king. \n"
    29: '²⁹ As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, they are
      written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet
