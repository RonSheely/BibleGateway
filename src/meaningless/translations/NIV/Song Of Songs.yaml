      \ vineyards;\n    my own vineyard I had to neglect.\n"
    7: "⁷ Tell me, you whom I love,\n    where you graze your flock\n    and where\

      \ burns like blazing fire,\n    like a mighty flame.\n"
    7: "⁷ Many waters cannot quench love;\n    rivers cannot sweep it away.\nIf one\
      \ were to give\n    all the wealth of one’s house for love,\n    it would be\
      \ utterly scorned. \n"
    8: "⁸ We have a little sister,\n    and her breasts are not yet grown.\nWhat shall\
      \ we do for our sister\n    on the day she is spoken for?\n"
