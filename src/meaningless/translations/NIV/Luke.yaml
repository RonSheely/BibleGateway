Luke:
  1:
    1: '¹ Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been
      fulfilled among us, '
    2: '² just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses
      and servants of the word. '
    3: '³ With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything
      from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most
      excellent Theophilus, '
    4: "⁴ so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n"
    5: '⁵ In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who
      belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant
      of Aaron. '
    6: '⁶ Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s
      commands and decrees blamelessly. '
    7: "⁷ But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and\
      \ they were both very old. \n"
    8: '⁸ Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest
      before God, '
    9: '⁹ he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into
      the temple of the Lord and burn incense. '
    10: "¹⁰ And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers\
      \ were praying outside. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side
      of the altar of incense. '
    12: '¹² When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. '
    13: '¹³ But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has
      been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him
      John. '
    14: '¹⁴ He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of
      his birth, '
    15: '¹⁵ for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine
      or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before
      he is born. '
    16: '¹⁶ He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. '
    17: "¹⁷ And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah,\
      \ to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to\
      \ the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”\
      \ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man\
      \ and my wife is well along in years.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God,
      and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. '
    20: "²⁰ And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens,\
      \ because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed\
      \ time.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he
      stayed so long in the temple. '
    22: "²² When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen\
      \ a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable\
      \ to speak. \n"
    23: '²³ When his time of service was completed, he returned home. '
    24: '²⁴ After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained
      in seclusion. '
    25: "²⁵ “The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown\
      \ his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel
      to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, '
    27: '²⁷ to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant
      of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. '
    28: "²⁸ The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored!\
      \ The Lord is with you.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting
      this might be. '
    30: '³⁰ But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor
      with God. '
    31: '³¹ You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. '
    32: '³² He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord
      God will give him the throne of his father David, '
    33: "³³ and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never\
      \ end.” \n"
    34: "³⁴ “How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?” \n"
    35: '³⁵ The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of
      the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called
      the Son of God. '
    36: '³⁶ Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age,
      and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. '
    37: "³⁷ For no word from God will ever fail.” \n"
    38: "³⁸ “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.”\
      \ Then the angel left her. \n"
    39: '³⁹ At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country
      of Judea, '
    40: '⁴⁰ where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth. '
    41: '⁴¹ When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and
      Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. '
    42: '⁴² In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed
      is the child you will bear! '
    43: '⁴³ But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? '
    44: '⁴⁴ As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my
      womb leaped for joy. '
    45: "⁴⁵ Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises\
      \ to her!” \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ And Mary said:\n“My soul glorifies the Lord\n"
    47: "⁴⁷     and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,\n"
    48: "⁴⁸ for he has been mindful\n    of the humble state of his servant.\nFrom\
      \ now on all generations will call me blessed,\n"
    49: "⁴⁹     for the Mighty One has done great things for me—\n    holy is his\
      \ name.\n"
    50: "⁵⁰ His mercy extends to those who fear him,\n    from generation to generation.\n"
    51: "⁵¹ He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;\n    he has scattered those\
      \ who are proud in their inmost thoughts.\n"
    52: "⁵² He has brought down rulers from their thrones\n    but has lifted up the\
      \ humble.\n"
    53: "⁵³ He has filled the hungry with good things\n    but has sent the rich away\
      \ empty.\n"
    54: "⁵⁴ He has helped his servant Israel,\n    remembering to be merciful\n"
    55: "⁵⁵ to Abraham and his descendants forever,\n    just as he promised our ancestors.”\
      \ \n"
    56: "⁵⁶ Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.\
      \ \n"
    57: '⁵⁷ When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. '
    58: "⁵⁸ Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy,\
      \ and they shared her joy. \n"
    59: '⁵⁹ On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going
      to name him after his father Zechariah, '
    60: "⁶⁰ but his mother spoke up and said, “No! He is to be called John.” \n"
    61: "⁶¹ They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that name.”\
      \ \n"
    62: '⁶² Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to
      name the child. '
    63: '⁶³ He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote,
      “His name is John.” '
    64: '⁶⁴ Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began
      to speak, praising God. '
    65: '⁶⁵ All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country
      of Judea people were talking about all these things. '
    66: "⁶⁶ Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is this\
      \ child going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him. \n"
    67: "⁶⁷ His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: \n"
    68: "⁶⁸ “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    because he has come to\
      \ his people and redeemed them.\n"
    69: "⁶⁹ He has raised up a horn of salvation for us\n    in the house of his servant\
      \ David\n"
    70: "⁷⁰ (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),\n"
    71: "⁷¹ salvation from our enemies\n    and from the hand of all who hate us—\n"
    72: "⁷² to show mercy to our ancestors\n    and to remember his holy covenant,\n"
    73: "⁷³     the oath he swore to our father Abraham:\n"
    74: "⁷⁴ to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,\n    and to enable us to serve\
      \ him without fear\n"
    75: "⁷⁵     in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. \n"
    76: "⁷⁶ And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;\n    for\
      \ you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,\n"
    77: "⁷⁷ to give his people the knowledge of salvation\n    through the forgiveness\
      \ of their sins,\n"
    78: "⁷⁸ because of the tender mercy of our God,\n    by which the rising sun will\
      \ come to us from heaven\n"
    79: "⁷⁹ to shine on those living in darkness\n    and in the shadow of death,\n\
      to guide our feet into the path of peace.” \n"
    80: ⁸⁰ And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness
      until he appeared publicly to Israel.
  2:
    1: '¹ In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken
      of the entire Roman world. '
    2: '² (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor
      of Syria.) '
    3: "³ And everyone went to their own town to register. \n"
    4: '⁴ So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to
      Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. '
    5: '⁵ He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him
      and was expecting a child. '
    6: '⁶ While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, '
    7: "⁷ and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and\
      \ placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch
      over their flocks at night. '
    9: '⁹ An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around
      them, and they were terrified. '
    10: '¹⁰ But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that
      will cause great joy for all the people. '
    11: '¹¹ Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah,
      the Lord. '
    12: "¹² This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and\
      \ lying in a manger.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel,\
      \ praising God and saying, \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “Glory to God in the highest heaven,\n    and on earth peace to those\
      \ on whom his favor rests.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said\
      \ to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,\
      \ which the Lord has told us about.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying
      in the manger. '
    17: '¹⁷ When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been
      told them about this child, '
    18: '¹⁸ and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. '
    19: '¹⁹ But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. '
    20: "²⁰ The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things\
      \ they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. \n"
    21: "²¹ On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named\
      \ Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. \n"
    22: '²² When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses,
      Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord '
    23: '²³ (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to
      be consecrated to the Lord”), '
    24: "²⁴ and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the\
      \ Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and
      devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was
      on him. '
    26: '²⁶ It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before
      he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. '
    27: '²⁷ Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents
      brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, '
    28: "²⁸ Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,\n    you may now dismiss your servant\
      \ in peace.\n"
    30: "³⁰ For my eyes have seen your salvation,\n"
    31: "³¹     which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:\n"
    32: "³² a light for revelation to the Gentiles,\n    and the glory of your people\
      \ Israel.” \n"
    33: '³³ The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. '
    34: '³⁴ Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is
      destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign
      that will be spoken against, '
    35: "³⁵ so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will\
      \ pierce your own soul too.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of
      Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her
      marriage, '
    37: '³⁷ and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple
      but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. '
    38: "³⁸ Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke\
      \ about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord,
      they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. '
    40: "⁴⁰ And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the\
      \ grace of God was on him. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. '
    42: '⁴² When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according
      to the custom. '
    43: '⁴³ After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the
      boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they
      began looking for him among their relatives and friends. '
    45: '⁴⁵ When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. '
    46: '⁴⁶ After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the
      teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. '
    48: "⁴⁸ When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him,\
      \ “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously\
      \ searching for you.” \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be
      in my Father’s house?” '
    50: "⁵⁰ But they did not understand what he was saying to them. \n"
    51: '⁵¹ Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But
      his mother treasured all these things in her heart. '
    52: ⁵² And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
  3:
    1: '¹ In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate
      was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch
      of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene— '
    2: '² during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to
      John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. '
    3: '³ He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance
      for the forgiveness of sins. '
    4: "⁴ As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:\n“A voice\
      \ of one calling in the wilderness,\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord,\n    make\
      \ straight paths for him.\n"
    5: "⁵ Every valley shall be filled in,\n    every mountain and hill made low.\n\
      The crooked roads shall become straight,\n    the rough ways smooth.\n"
    6: "⁶ And all people will see God’s salvation.’” \n"
    7: '⁷ John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of
      vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? '
    8: '⁸ Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves,
      ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God
      can raise up children for Abraham. '
    9: "⁹ The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not\
      \ produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “What should we do then?” the crowd asked. \n"
    11: "¹¹ John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who\
      \ has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.” \n"
    12: "¹² Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what\
      \ should we do?” \n"
    13: "¹³ “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”\nHe replied, “Don’t\
      \ extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts
      if John might possibly be the Messiah. '
    16: '¹⁶ John answered them all, “I baptize you with water. But one who is more
      powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.
      He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. '
    17: '¹⁷ His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to
      gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
      fire.” '
    18: "¹⁸ And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the\
      \ good news to them. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias,
      his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done, '
    20: "²⁰ Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison. \n"
    21: '²¹ When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as
      he was praying, heaven was opened '
    22: "²² and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a\
      \ voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”\

  4:
    1: '¹ Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit
      into the wilderness, '
    2: "² where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during\
      \ those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. \n"
    3: "³ The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become\
      \ bread.” \n"
    4: "⁴ Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the

    6: '⁶ And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it

    7: "⁷ If you worship me, it will all be yours.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him\

      \ time. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him
      spread through the whole countryside. '
    15: "¹⁵ He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath
      day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, '
    17: "¹⁷ and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it,\
      \ he found the place where it is written: \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The Spirit of the Lord is on me,\n    because he has anointed me\n  \
      \  to proclaim good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to proclaim freedom for\
      \ the prisoners\n    and recovery of sight for the blind,\nto set the oppressed\
      \ free,\n"
    19: "¹⁹     to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down.
      The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. '
    21: "²¹ He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your\
      \ hearing.” \n"
    22: "²² All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came\
      \ from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked. \n"
    23: "²³ Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician,\
      \ heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we have\
      \ heard that you did in Capernaum.’” \n"
    24: '²⁴ “Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown. '
    25: '²⁵ I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when
      the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout
      the land. '
    26: '²⁶ Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in
      the region of Sidon. '
    27: "²⁷ And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet,\
      \ yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. '
    29: '²⁹ They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the
      hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. '
    30: "³⁰ But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. \n"
    31: '³¹ Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath
      he taught the people. '
    32: "³² They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. \n"
    33: '³³ In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit.
      He cried out at the top of his voice, '
    34: "³⁴ “Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to\
      \ destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” \n"
    35: "³⁵ “Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw\
      \ the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. \n"
    36: '³⁶ All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are!
      With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!” '
    37: "³⁷ And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. \n"
    38: '³⁸ Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law
      was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. '
    39: "³⁹ So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up\
      \ at once and began to wait on them. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness,
      and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. '
    41: "⁴¹ Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of\
      \ God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they\
      \ knew he was the Messiah. \n"
    42: '⁴² At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking
      for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving
      them. '
    43: '⁴³ But he said, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the
      other towns also, because that is why I was sent.” '
    44: ⁴⁴ And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
  5:
    1: '¹ One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were
      crowding around him and listening to the word of God. '
    2: '² He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were
      washing their nets. '
    3: "³ He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him\
      \ to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from\
      \ the boat. \n"
    4: "⁴ When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water,\
      \ and let down the nets for a catch.” \n"
    5: "⁵ Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught\
      \ anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.” \n"
    6: '⁶ When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their
      nets began to break. '
    7: "⁷ So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them,\
      \ and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. \n"
    8: '⁸ When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from
      me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” '
    9: '⁹ For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they
      had taken, '
    10: "¹⁰ and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.\nThen\
      \ Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.” "
    11: "¹¹ So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered\
      \ with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged\
      \ him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” \n"
    13: "¹³ Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said.\
      \ “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Then Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the\
      \ priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as\
      \ a testimony to them.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came
      to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. '
    16: "¹⁶ But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were
      sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and
      Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. '
    18: '¹⁸ Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him
      into the house to lay him before Jesus. '
    19: "¹⁹ When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went\
      \ up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle\
      \ of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. \n"
    20: "²⁰ When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”\
      \ \n"
    21: "²¹ The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves,\
      \ “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”\
      \ \n"
    22: '²² Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these
      things in your hearts? '
    23: '²³ Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up
      and walk’? '
    24: '²⁴ But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive
      sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and
      go home.” '
    25: '²⁵ Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying
      on and went home praising God. '
    26: "²⁶ Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe\
      \ and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.” \n"
    27: '²⁷ After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi
      sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him, '
    28: "²⁸ and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. \n"
    29: '²⁹ Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd
      of tax collectors and others were eating with them. '
    30: "³⁰ But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect\
      \ complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors\
      \ and sinners?” \n"
    31: '³¹ Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the
      sick. '
    32: "³² I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” \n"
    33: "³³ They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the\
      \ disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.” \n"
    34: '³⁴ Jesus answered, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while
      he is with them? '
    35: "³⁵ But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in\
      \ those days they will fast.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ He told them this parable: “No one tears a piece out of a new garment
      to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the
      patch from the new will not match the old. '
    37: '³⁷ And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine
      will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. '
    38: '³⁸ No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. '
    39: ³⁹ And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old
      is better.’”
  6:
    1: '¹ One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began
      to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. '
    2: "² Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the\
      \ Sabbath?” \n"
    3: '³ Jesus answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his
      companions were hungry? '
    4: '⁴ He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what
      is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.” '
    5: "⁵ Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” \n"
    6: '⁶ On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man
      was there whose right hand was shriveled. '
    7: '⁷ The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse
      Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. '
    8: "⁸ But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled\
      \ hand, “Get up and stand in front of everyone.” So he got up and stood there.\
      \ \n"
    9: "⁹ Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to\
      \ do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, “Stretch out your
      hand.” He did so, and his hand was completely restored. '
    11: "¹¹ But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to\
      \ discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. \n"
    12: '¹² One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent
      the night praying to God. '
    13: '¹³ When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of
      them, whom he also designated apostles: '
    14: '¹⁴ Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip,
      Bartholomew, '
    15: '¹⁵ Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, '
    16: "¹⁶ Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his
      disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem,
      and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, '
    18: '¹⁸ who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled
      by impure spirits were cured, '
    19: "¹⁹ and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him\
      \ and healing them all. \n"
    20: "²⁰ Looking at his disciples, he said:\n“Blessed are you who are poor,\n \
      \   for yours is the kingdom of God.\n"
    21: "²¹ Blessed are you who hunger now,\n    for you will be satisfied.\nBlessed\
      \ are you who weep now,\n    for you will laugh.\n"
    22: "²² Blessed are you when people hate you,\n    when they exclude you and insult\
      \ you\n    and reject your name as evil,\n        because of the Son of Man.\
      \ \n"
    23: "²³ “Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in\
      \ heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets. \n"
    24: "²⁴ “But woe to you who are rich,\n    for you have already received your\
      \ comfort.\n"
    25: "²⁵ Woe to you who are well fed now,\n    for you will go hungry.\nWoe to\
      \ you who laugh now,\n    for you will mourn and weep.\n"
    26: "²⁶ Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you,\n    for that is how their\
      \ ancestors treated the false prophets. \n"
    27: '²⁷ “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those
      who hate you, '
    28: '²⁸ bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. '
    29: '²⁹ If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone
      takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. '
    30: '³⁰ Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you,
      do not demand it back. '
    31: "³¹ Do to others as you would have them do to you. \n"
    32: '³² “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners
      love those who love them. '
    33: '³³ And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to
      you? Even sinners do that. '
    34: '³⁴ And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is
      that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. '
    35: '³⁵ But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting
      to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children
      of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. '
    36: "³⁶ Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. \n"
    37: '³⁷ “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will
      not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. '
    38: "³⁸ Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken\
      \ together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure\
      \ you use, it will be measured to you.” \n"
    39: '³⁹ He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they
      not both fall into a pit? '
    40: "⁴⁰ The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained\
      \ will be like their teacher. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay
      no attention to the plank in your own eye? '
    42: "⁴² How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of\
      \ your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite,\
      \ first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove\
      \ the speck from your brother’s eye. \n"
    43: '⁴³ “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from
      thornbushes, or grapes from briers. '
    45: "⁴⁵ A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart,\
      \ and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.\
      \ For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? '
    47: '⁴⁷ As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into
      practice, I will show you what they are like. '
    48: '⁴⁸ They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation
      on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake
      it, because it was well built. '
    49: ⁴⁹ But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like
      a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent
      struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
  7:
    1: '¹ When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening,
      he entered Capernaum. '
    2: '² There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and
      about to die. '
    3: '³ The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking
      him to come and heal his servant. '
    4: '⁴ When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves
      to have you do this, '
    5: '⁵ because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” '
    6: "⁶ So Jesus went with them.\nHe was not far from the house when the centurion\
      \ sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve\
      \ to have you come under my roof. "
    7: '⁷ That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say
      the word, and my servant will be healed. '
    8: "⁸ For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this\
      \ one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant,\
      \ ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” \n"
    9: '⁹ When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following
      him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.” '
    10: "¹⁰ Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant\
      \ well. \n"
    11: '¹¹ Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and
      a large crowd went along with him. '
    12: '¹² As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the
      only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town
      was with her. '
    13: "¹³ When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”\
      \ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the
      bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” '
    15: "¹⁵ The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his\
      \ mother. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared
      among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.” '
    17: "¹⁷ This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, '
    19: "¹⁹ he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should\
      \ we expect someone else?” \n"
    20: "²⁰ When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you\
      \ to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”\
      \ \n"
    21: '²¹ At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil
      spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. '
    22: '²² So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you
      have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have
      leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news
      is proclaimed to the poor. '
    23: "²³ Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.” \n"
    24: '²⁴ After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about
      John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the
      wind? '
    25: '²⁵ If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No,
      those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. '
    26: '²⁶ But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than
      a prophet. '
    27: "²⁷ This is the one about whom it is written:\n“‘I will send my messenger\
      \ ahead of you,\n    who will prepare your way before you.’ \n"
    28: "²⁸ I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John;\
      \ yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words,
      acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John. '
    30: "³⁰ But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for\
      \ themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) \n"
    31: '³¹ Jesus went on to say, “To what, then, can I compare the people of this
      generation? What are they like? '
    32: "³² They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each\
      \ other:\n“‘We played the pipe for you,\n    and you did not dance;\nwe sang\
      \ a dirge,\n    and you did not cry.’ \n"
    33: '³³ For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and
      you say, ‘He has a demon.’ '
    34: '³⁴ The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton
      and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ '
    35: "³⁵ But wisdom is proved right by all her children.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went
      to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. '
    37: '³⁷ A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating
      at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. '
    38: "³⁸ As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet\
      \ with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured\
      \ perfume on them. \n"
    39: "³⁹ When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If\
      \ this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of\
      \ woman she is—that she is a sinner.” \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.”\n“Tell me,\
      \ teacher,” he said. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred
      denarii, and the other fifty. '
    42: "⁴² Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts\
      \ of both. Now which of them will love him more?” \n"
    43: "⁴³ Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”\n\
      “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said. \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman?
      I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet
      my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. '
    45: '⁴⁵ You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has
      not stopped kissing my feet. '
    46: '⁴⁶ You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. '
    47: "⁴⁷ Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love\
      \ has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.” \n"
    48: "⁴⁸ Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even\
      \ forgives sins?” \n"
    50: ⁵⁰ Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”
  8:
    1: '¹ After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming
      the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, '
    2: '² and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary
      (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; '
    3: "³ Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and\
      \ many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town
      after town, he told this parable: '
    5: '⁵ “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some
      fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. '
    6: '⁶ Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because
      they had no moisture. '
    7: '⁷ Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. '
    8: "⁸ Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred\
      \ times more than was sown.”\nWhen he said this, he called out, “Whoever has\
      \ ears to hear, let them hear.” \n"
    9: '⁹ His disciples asked him what this parable meant. '
    10: "¹⁰ He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been\
      \ given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,\n“‘though seeing,\
      \ they may not see;\n    though hearing, they may not understand.’ \n"
    11: '¹¹ “This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. '
    12: '¹² Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and
      takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. '
    13: '¹³ Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when
      they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time
      of testing they fall away. '
    14: '¹⁴ The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they
      go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and
      they do not mature. '
    15: "¹⁵ But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart,\
      \ who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed.
      Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. '
    17: '¹⁷ For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed
      that will not be known or brought out into the open. '
    18: "¹⁸ Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given\
      \ more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken\
      \ from them.” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able
      to get near him because of the crowd. '
    20: "²⁰ Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting\
      \ to see you.” \n"
    21: "²¹ He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and\
      \ put it into practice.” \n"
    22: '²² One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side
      of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out. '
    23: "²³ As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that\
      \ the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. \n"
    24: "²⁴ The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going\
      \ to drown!”\nHe got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm\
      \ subsided, and all was calm. "
    25: "²⁵ “Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples.\nIn fear and amazement\
      \ they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water,\
      \ and they obey him.” \n"
    26: '²⁶ They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from
      Galilee. '
    27: '²⁷ When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the
      town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but
      had lived in the tombs. '
    28: '²⁸ When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the
      top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
      I beg you, don’t torture me!” '
    29: "²⁹ For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many\
      \ times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept\
      \ under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into\
      \ solitary places. \n"
    30: "³⁰ Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\n“Legion,” he replied, because many\
      \ demons had gone into him. "
    31: "³¹ And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.\
      \ \n"
    32: '³² A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged
      Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. '
    33: "³³ When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the\
      \ herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. \n"
    34: '³⁴ When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported
      this in the town and countryside, '
    35: '³⁵ and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus,
      they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet,
      dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. '
    36: '³⁶ Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had
      been cured. '
    37: "³⁷ Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave\
      \ them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.\
      \ \n"
    38: '³⁸ The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus
      sent him away, saying, '
    39: "³⁹ “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went\
      \ away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting
      him. '
    41: '⁴¹ Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet,
      pleading with him to come to his house '
    42: "⁴² because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying.\nAs Jesus\
      \ was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. "
    43: '⁴³ And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years,
      but no one could heal her. '
    44: "⁴⁴ She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately\
      \ her bleeding stopped. \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ “Who touched me?” Jesus asked.\nWhen they all denied it, Peter said, “Master,\
      \ the people are crowding and pressing against you.” \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from\
      \ me.” \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling
      and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had
      touched him and how she had been instantly healed. '
    48: "⁴⁸ Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”\
      \ \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus,\
      \ the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the\
      \ teacher anymore.” \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid; just believe, and\
      \ she will be healed.” \n"
    51: '⁵¹ When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with
      him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother. '
    52: "⁵² Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. “Stop wailing,”\
      \ Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.” \n"
    53: '⁵³ They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. '
    54: '⁵⁴ But he took her by the hand and said, “My child, get up!” '
    55: '⁵⁵ Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to
      give her something to eat. '
    56: ⁵⁶ Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what
      had happened.
  9:
    1: '¹ When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority
      to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, '
    2: '² and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. '
    3: '³ He told them: “Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread,
      no money, no extra shirt. '
    4: '⁴ Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. '
    5: '⁵ If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your
      feet as a testimony against them.” '
    6: "⁶ So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news\
      \ and healing people everywhere. \n"
    7: '⁷ Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed
      because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, '
    8: '⁸ others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets
      of long ago had come back to life. '
    9: "⁹ But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things\
      \ about?” And he tried to see him. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done.
      Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called
      Bethsaida, '
    11: "¹¹ but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and\
      \ spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.\
      \ \n"
    12: "¹² Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd\
      \ away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food\
      \ and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.” \n"
    13: "¹³ He replied, “You give them something to eat.”\nThey answered, “We have\
      \ only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this\
      \ crowd.” "
    14: "¹⁴ (About five thousand men were there.)\nBut he said to his disciples, “Have\
      \ them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” "
    15: '¹⁵ The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. '
    16: '¹⁶ Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave
      thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the
      people. '
    17: "¹⁷ They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls\
      \ of broken pieces that were left over. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him,\
      \ he asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still\
      \ others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.” \n"
    20: "²⁰ “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”\nPeter answered,\
      \ “God’s Messiah.” \n"
    21: '²¹ Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. '
    22: "²² And he said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by\
      \ the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be\
      \ killed and on the third day be raised to life.” \n"
    23: '²³ Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves
      and take up their cross daily and follow me. '
    24: '²⁴ For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their
      life for me will save it. '
    25: '²⁵ What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit
      their very self? '
    26: "²⁶ Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed\
      \ of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the\
      \ holy angels. \n"
    27: "²⁷ “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before\
      \ they see the kingdom of God.” \n"
    28: '²⁸ About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James
      with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. '
    29: '²⁹ As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes
      became as bright as a flash of lightning. '
    30: '³⁰ Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with
      Jesus. '
    31: '³¹ They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment
      at Jerusalem. '
    32: '³² Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully
      awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. '
    33: "³³ As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good\
      \ for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses\
      \ and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) \n"
    34: '³⁴ While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were
      afraid as they entered the cloud. '
    35: '³⁵ A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen;
      listen to him.” '
    36: "³⁶ When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples\
      \ kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had\
      \ seen. \n"
    37: '³⁷ The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met
      him. '
    38: '³⁸ A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son,
      for he is my only child. '
    39: '³⁹ A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions
      so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying
      him. '
    40: "⁴⁰ I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.” \n"
    41: "⁴¹ “You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall\
      \ I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.” \n"
    42: '⁴² Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a
      convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him
      back to his father. '
    43: "⁴³ And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.\nWhile everyone was\
      \ marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, "
    44: '⁴⁴ “Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going
      to be delivered into the hands of men.” '
    45: "⁴⁵ But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them,\
      \ so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. \n"
    46: '⁴⁶ An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the
      greatest. '
    47: '⁴⁷ Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside
      him. '
    48: "⁴⁸ Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes\
      \ me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one\
      \ who is least among you all who is the greatest.” \n"
    49: "⁴⁹ “Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and\
      \ we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.” \n"
    50: "⁵⁰ “Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is not against you is for\
      \ you.” \n"
    51: '⁵¹ As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely
      set out for Jerusalem. '
    52: '⁵² And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to
      get things ready for him; '
    53: '⁵³ but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. '
    54: '⁵⁴ When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you
      want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?” '
    55: '⁵⁵ But Jesus turned and rebuked them. '
    56: "⁵⁶ Then he and his disciples went to another village. \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow\
      \ you wherever you go.” \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man\
      \ has no place to lay his head.” \n"
    59: "⁵⁹ He said to another man, “Follow me.”\nBut he replied, “Lord, first let\
      \ me go and bury my father.” \n"
    60: "⁶⁰ Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim\
      \ the kingdom of God.” \n"
    61: "⁶¹ Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back\
      \ and say goodbye to my family.” \n"
    62: ⁶² Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit
      for service in the kingdom of God.”
  10:
    1: '¹ After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two
      ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. '
    2: '² He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the
      Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. '
    3: '³ Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. '
    4: "⁴ Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.\
      \ \n"
    5: '⁵ “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ '
    6: '⁶ If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if
      not, it will return to you. '
    7: "⁷ Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves\
      \ his wages. Do not move around from house to house. \n"
    8: '⁸ “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. '
    9: '⁹ Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come
      near to you.’ '
    10: '¹⁰ But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and
      say, '
    11: '¹¹ ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you.
      Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’ '
    12: "¹² I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that\
      \ town. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that
      were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have
      repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. '
    14: '¹⁴ But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for
      you. '
    15: "¹⁵ And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go\
      \ down to Hades. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me;\
      \ but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit\
      \ to us in your name.” \n"
    18: '¹⁸ He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. '
    19: '¹⁹ I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome
      all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. '
    20: "²⁰ However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that\
      \ your names are written in heaven.” \n"
    21: "²¹ At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise\
      \ you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things\
      \ from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father,\
      \ for this is what you were pleased to do. \n"
    22: "²² “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the\
      \ Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son\
      \ and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” \n"
    23: '²³ Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes
      that see what you see. '
    24: "²⁴ For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see\
      \ but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.” \n"
    25: "²⁵ On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,”\
      \ he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” \n"
    26: "²⁶ “What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?” \n"
    27: "²⁷ He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all\
      \ your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your\
      \ neighbor as yourself.’” \n"
    28: "²⁸ “You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”\
      \ \n"
    29: "²⁹ But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”\
      \ \n"
    30: '³⁰ In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
      when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him
      and went away, leaving him half dead. '
    31: '³¹ A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the
      man, he passed by on the other side. '
    32: '³² So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on
      the other side. '
    33: '³³ But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw
      him, he took pity on him. '
    34: '³⁴ He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then
      he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. '
    35: "³⁵ The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look\
      \ after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra\
      \ expense you may have.’ \n"
    36: "³⁶ “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell\
      \ into the hands of robbers?” \n"
    37: "³⁷ The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”\nJesus\
      \ told him, “Go and do likewise.” \n"
    38: '³⁸ As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where
      a woman named Martha opened her home to him. '
    39: '³⁹ She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to
      what he said. '
    40: "⁴⁰ But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made.\
      \ She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me\
      \ to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!” \n"
    41: '⁴¹ “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about
      many things, '
    42: ⁴² but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better,
      and it will not be taken away from her.”
  11:
    1: "¹ One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his\
      \ disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”\
      \ \n"
    2: "² He said to them, “When you pray, say:\n“‘Father,\nhallowed be your name,\n\
      your kingdom come.\n"
    3: "³ Give us each day our daily bread.\n"
    4: "⁴ Forgive us our sins,\n    for we also forgive everyone who sins against\
      \ us.\nAnd lead us not into temptation.’” \n"
    5: '⁵ Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at
      midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; '
    6: '⁶ a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer
      him.’ '
    7: '⁷ And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already
      locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’ '
    8: "⁸ I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because\
      \ of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up\
      \ and give you as much as you need. \n"
    9: '⁹ “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find;
      knock and the door will be opened to you. '
    10: "¹⁰ For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one\
      \ who knocks, the door will be opened. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake
      instead? '
    12: '¹² Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? '
    13: "¹³ If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your\
      \ children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to\
      \ those who ask him!” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the
      man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. '
    15: '¹⁵ But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving
      out demons.” '
    16: "¹⁶ Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: “Any kingdom divided against
      itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. '
    18: '¹⁸ If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say
      this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. '
    19: '¹⁹ Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive
      them out? So then, they will be your judges. '
    20: "²⁰ But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God\
      \ has come upon you. \n"
    21: '²¹ “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions
      are safe. '
    22: "²² But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the\
      \ armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder. \n"
    23: "²³ “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with\
      \ me scatters. \n"
    24: '²⁴ “When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places
      seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house
      I left.’ '
    25: '²⁵ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. '
    26: "²⁶ Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and\
      \ they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse\
      \ than the first.” \n"
    27: "²⁷ As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed\
      \ is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey\
      \ it.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ As the crowds increased, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It
      asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. '
    30: '³⁰ For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man
      be to this generation. '
    31: '³¹ The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this
      generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen
      to Solomon’s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here. '
    32: "³² The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation\
      \ and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something\
      \ greater than Jonah is here. \n"
    33: '³³ “No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden,
      or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in
      may see the light. '
    34: '³⁴ Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole
      body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full
      of darkness. '
    35: '³⁵ See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. '
    36: "³⁶ Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark,\
      \ it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him;
      so he went in and reclined at the table. '
    38: "³⁸ But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first\
      \ wash before the meal. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Then the Lord said to him, “Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside
      of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. '
    40: '⁴⁰ You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside
      also? '
    41: "⁴¹ But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything\
      \ will be clean for you. \n"
    42: "⁴² “Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue\
      \ and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love\
      \ of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.\
      \ \n"
    43: "⁴³ “Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the\
      \ synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ “Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over\
      \ without knowing it.” \n"
    45: "⁴⁵ One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these\
      \ things, you insult us also.” \n"
    46: "⁴⁶ Jesus replied, “And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load\
      \ people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not\
      \ lift one finger to help them. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ “Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your
      ancestors who killed them. '
    48: '⁴⁸ So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed
      the prophets, and you build their tombs. '
    49: '⁴⁹ Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and
      apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’ '
    50: '⁵⁰ Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all
      the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, '
    51: "⁵¹ from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between\
      \ the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held\
      \ responsible for it all. \n"
    52: "⁵² “Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to\
      \ knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who\
      \ were entering.” \n"
    53: '⁵³ When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began
      to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, '
    54: ⁵⁴ waiting to catch him in something he might say.
  12:
    1: '¹ Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were
      trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying:
      “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. '
    2: '² There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will
      not be made known. '
    3: "³ What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you\
      \ have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.\
      \ \n"
    4: '⁴ “I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and
      after that can do no more. '
    5: '⁵ But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body
      has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear
      him. '
    6: '⁶ Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten
      by God. '
    7: "⁷ Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you\
      \ are worth more than many sparrows. \n"
    8: '⁸ “I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of
      Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. '
    9: '⁹ But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels
      of God. '
    10: "¹⁰ And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven,\
      \ but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. \n"
    11: '¹¹ “When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not
      worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, '
    12: "¹² for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.”\
      \ \n"
    13: "¹³ Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide\
      \ the inheritance with me.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?” '
    15: "¹⁵ Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of\
      \ greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded
      an abundant harvest. '
    17: "¹⁷ He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’\
      \ \n"
    18: '¹⁸ “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build
      bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. '
    19: "¹⁹ And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years.\
      \ Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded\
      \ from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ \n"
    21: "²¹ “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but\
      \ is not rich toward God.” \n"
    22: '²² Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry
      about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. '
    23: '²³ For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. '
    24: '²⁴ Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or
      barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! '
    25: '²⁵ Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life? '
    26: "²⁶ Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the\
      \ rest? \n"
    27: '²⁷ “Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I
      tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. '
    28: '²⁸ If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today,
      and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of
      little faith! '
    29: '²⁹ And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry
      about it. '
    30: '³⁰ For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows
      that you need them. '
    31: "³¹ But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. \n"
    32: '³² “Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give
      you the kingdom. '
    33: '³³ Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves
      that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no
      thief comes near and no moth destroys. '
    34: "³⁴ For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. \n"
    35: '³⁵ “Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, '
    36: '³⁶ like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet,
      so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. '
    37: '³⁷ It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when
      he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline
      at the table and will come and wait on them. '
    38: '³⁸ It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even
      if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. '
    39: '³⁹ But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour
      the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. '
    40: "⁴⁰ You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when\
      \ you do not expect him.” \n"
    41: "⁴¹ Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?”\
      \ \n"
    42: '⁴² The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the
      master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the
      proper time? '
    43: '⁴³ It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he
      returns. '
    44: '⁴⁴ Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. '
    45: '⁴⁵ But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time
      in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women,
      and to eat and drink and get drunk. '
    46: "⁴⁶ The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect\
      \ him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign\
      \ him a place with the unbelievers. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ “The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does
      not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. '
    48: "⁴⁸ But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will\
      \ be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will\
      \ be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more\
      \ will be asked. \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ “I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already
      kindled! '
    50: '⁵⁰ But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until
      it is completed! '
    51: '⁵¹ Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. '
    52: '⁵² From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other,
      three against two and two against three. '
    53: "⁵³ They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother\
      \ against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law\
      \ and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” \n"
    54: '⁵⁴ He said to the crowd: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately
      you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it does. '
    55: '⁵⁵ And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it
      is. '
    56: "⁵⁶ Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and\
      \ the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this present time?\
      \ \n"
    57: '⁵⁷ “Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right? '
    58: '⁵⁸ As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be
      reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and
      the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. '
    59: ⁵⁹ I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.”
  13:
    1: '¹ Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans
      whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. '
    2: '² Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than
      all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? '
    3: '³ I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. '
    4: '⁴ Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you
      think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? '
    5: "⁵ I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.” \n"
    6: '⁶ Then he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard,
      and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. '
    7: "⁷ So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now\
      \ I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any.\
      \ Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’ \n"
    8: '⁸ “‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig
      around it and fertilize it. '
    9: "⁹ If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, '
    11: '¹¹ and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years.
      She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. '
    12: '¹² When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you
      are set free from your infirmity.” '
    13: "¹³ Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and\
      \ praised God. \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader\
      \ said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on\
      \ those days, not on the Sabbath.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath
      untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? '
    16: "¹⁶ Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept\
      \ bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound\
      \ her?” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were\
      \ delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. \n"
    18: '¹⁸ Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare
      it to? '
    19: "¹⁹ It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden.\
      \ It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Again he asked, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? '
    21: "²¹ It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of\
      \ flour until it worked all through the dough.” \n"
    22: '²² Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his
      way to Jerusalem. '
    23: "²³ Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?”\n\
      He said to them, "
    24: '²⁴ “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell
      you, will try to enter and will not be able to. '
    25: "²⁵ Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand\
      \ outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’\n“But he will\
      \ answer, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’ \n"
    26: "²⁶ “Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our\
      \ streets.’ \n"
    27: "²⁷ “But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from\
      \ me, all you evildoers!’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham,
      Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves
      thrown out. '
    29: '²⁹ People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take
      their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. '
    30: "³⁰ Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will\
      \ be last.” \n"
    31: "³¹ At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this\
      \ place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.” \n"
    32: '³² He replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on driving out demons and
      healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.’ '
    33: "³³ In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely\
      \ no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! \n"
    34: '³⁴ “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent
      to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers
      her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. '
    35: ³⁵ Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see
      me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”
  14:
    1: '¹ One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee,
      he was being carefully watched. '
    2: '² There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his
      body. '
    3: '³ Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to heal
      on the Sabbath or not?” '
    4: "⁴ But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent\
      \ him on his way. \n"
    5: '⁵ Then he asked them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into
      a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?” '
    6: "⁶ And they had nothing to say. \n"
    7: '⁷ When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table,
      he told them this parable: '
    8: '⁸ “When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor,
      for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. '
    9: '⁹ If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give
      this person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important
      place. '
    10: '¹⁰ But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host
      comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will
      be honored in the presence of all the other guests. '
    11: "¹¹ For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble\
      \ themselves will be exalted.” \n"
    12: '¹² Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not
      invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich
      neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. '
    13: '¹³ But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame,
      the blind, '
    14: "¹⁴ and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid\
      \ at the resurrection of the righteous.” \n"
    15: "¹⁵ When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus,\
      \ “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.” \n"
    16: '¹⁶ Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited
      many guests. '
    17: "¹⁷ At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been\
      \ invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just\
      \ bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way\
      \ to try them out. Please excuse me.’ \n"
    20: "²⁰ “Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’ \n"
    21: "²¹ “The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner\
      \ of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the\
      \ streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind\
      \ and the lame.’ \n"
    22: "²² “‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is\
      \ still room.’ \n"
    23: '²³ “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes
      and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. '
    24: "²⁴ I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.’”\
      \ \n"
    25: '²⁵ Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: '
    26: '²⁶ “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children,
      brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple. '
    27: "²⁷ And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and
      estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? '
    29: '²⁹ For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone
      who sees it will ridicule you, '
    30: "³⁰ saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’ \n"
    31: '³¹ “Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he
      first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose
      the one coming against him with twenty thousand? '
    32: '³² If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still
      a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. '
    33: "³³ In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot\
      \ be my disciples. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty
      again? '
    35: "³⁵ It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.\n\
      “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”"
  15:
    1: '¹ Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. '
    2: "² But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes\
      \ sinners and eats with them.” \n"
    3: '³ Then Jesus told them this parable: '
    4: '⁴ “Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he
      leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until
      he finds it? '
    5: '⁵ And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders '
    6: '⁶ and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says,
      ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ '
    7: "⁷ I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over\
      \ one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not\
      \ need to repent. \n"
    8: '⁸ “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light
      a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? '
    9: '⁹ And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and
      says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ '
    10: "¹⁰ In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the\
      \ angels of God over one sinner who repents.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. '
    12: "¹² The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’\
      \ So he divided his property between them. \n"
    13: '¹³ “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off
      for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. '
    14: '¹⁴ After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole
      country, and he began to be in need. '
    15: '¹⁵ So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent
      him to his fields to feed pigs. '
    16: "¹⁶ He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating,\
      \ but no one gave him anything. \n"
    17: '¹⁷ “When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants
      have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! '
    18: '¹⁸ I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have
      sinned against heaven and against you. '
    19: '¹⁹ I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your
      hired servants.’ '
    20: "²⁰ So he got up and went to his father.\n“But while he was still a long way\
      \ off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to\
      \ his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. \n"
    21: "²¹ “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against\
      \ you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ \n"
    22: '²² “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and
      put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. '
    23: '²³ Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. '
    24: "²⁴ For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’\
      \ So they began to celebrate. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house,
      he heard music and dancing. '
    26: '²⁶ So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. '
    27: "²⁷ ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened\
      \ calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went
      out and pleaded with him. '
    29: '²⁹ But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for
      you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat
      so I could celebrate with my friends. '
    30: "³⁰ But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes\
      \ comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ \n"
    31: '³¹ “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I
      have is yours. '
    32: ³² But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was
      dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”
  16:
    1: '¹ Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused
      of wasting his possessions. '
    2: "² So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give\
      \ an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’\
      \ \n"
    3: '³ “The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking
      away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg— '
    4: "⁴ I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome\
      \ me into their houses.’ \n"
    5: "⁵ “So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How\
      \ much do you owe my master?’ \n"
    6: "⁶ “‘Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied.\n“The manager told him,\
      \ ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’ \n"
    7: "⁷ “Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’\n“‘A thousand bushels\
      \ of wheat,’ he replied.\n“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’\
      \ \n"
    8: '⁸ “The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly.
      For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind
      than are the people of the light. '
    9: "⁹ I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when\
      \ it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,
      and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. '
    11: '¹¹ So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will
      trust you with true riches? '
    12: "¹² And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who\
      \ will give you property of your own? \n"
    13: "¹³ “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the\
      \ other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot\
      \ serve both God and money.” \n"
    14: '¹⁴ The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. '
    15: "¹⁵ He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes\
      \ of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable\
      \ in God’s sight. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ “The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time,
      the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing
      their way into it. '
    17: "¹⁷ It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke\
      \ of a pen to drop out of the Law. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery,\
      \ and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived
      in luxury every day. '
    20: '²⁰ At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores '
    21: "²¹ and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs\
      \ came and licked his sores. \n"
    22: '²² “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s
      side. The rich man also died and was buried. '
    23: '²³ In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away,
      with Lazarus by his side. '
    24: "²⁴ So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus\
      \ to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in\
      \ agony in this fire.’ \n"
    25: '²⁵ “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received
      your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted
      here and you are in agony. '
    26: "²⁶ And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in\
      \ place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone\
      \ cross over from there to us.’ \n"
    27: '²⁷ “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, '
    28: "²⁸ for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also\
      \ come to this place of torment.’ \n"
    29: "²⁹ “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to\
      \ them.’ \n"
    30: "³⁰ “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to\
      \ them, they will repent.’ \n"
    31: ³¹ “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they
      will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”
  17:
    1: '¹ Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are bound
      to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. '
    2: '² It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied
      around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. '
    3: "³ So watch yourselves.\n“If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke\
      \ them; and if they repent, forgive them. "
    4: "⁴ Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back\
      \ to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.” \n"
    5: "⁵ The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” \n"
    6: "⁶ He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to\
      \ this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey\
      \ you. \n"
    7: '⁷ “Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will
      he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit
      down to eat’? '
    8: '⁸ Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on
      me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’? '
    9: '⁹ Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? '
    10: "¹⁰ So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should\
      \ say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’” \n"
    11: '¹¹ Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria
      and Galilee. '
    12: '¹² As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They
      stood at a distance '
    13: "¹³ and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as\
      \ they went, they were cleansed. \n"
    15: '¹⁵ One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud
      voice. '
    16: "¹⁶ He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.\
      \ \n"
    17: '¹⁷ Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? '
    18: '¹⁸ Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?” '
    19: "¹⁹ Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come,
      Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be
      observed, '
    21: "²¹ nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom\
      \ of God is in your midst.” \n"
    22: '²² Then he said to his disciples, “The time is coming when you will long
      to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. '
    23: '²³ People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running
      off after them. '
    24: '²⁴ For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes
      and lights up the sky from one end to the other. '
    25: "²⁵ But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.\
      \ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of
      the Son of Man. '
    27: "²⁷ People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up\
      \ to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.\
      \ \n"
    28: '²⁸ “It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking,
      buying and selling, planting and building. '
    29: "²⁹ But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and\
      \ destroyed them all. \n"
    30: '³⁰ “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. '
    31: '³¹ On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should
      go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. '
    32: '³² Remember Lot’s wife! '
    33: '³³ Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their
      life will preserve it. '
    34: '³⁴ I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken
      and the other left. '
    35: '³⁵ Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other
      left.” '
    36: "³⁶  \n"
    37: "³⁷ “Where, Lord?” they asked.\nHe replied, “Where there is a dead body, there\
      \ the vultures will gather.”"
  18:
    1: '¹ Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always
      pray and not give up. '
    2: '² He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor
      cared what people thought. '
    3: "³ And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea,\
      \ ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ \n"
    4: '⁴ “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though
      I don’t fear God or care what people think, '
    5: "⁵ yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice,\
      \ so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’” \n"
    6: '⁶ And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. '
    7: '⁷ And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to
      him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? '
    8: "⁸ I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when\
      \ the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?” \n"
    9: '⁹ To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on
      everyone else, Jesus told this parable: '
    10: '¹⁰ “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a
      tax collector. '
    11: '¹¹ The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am
      not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. '
    12: "¹² I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ \n"
    13: "¹³ “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up\
      \ to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’\
      \ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified\
      \ before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those\
      \ who humble themselves will be exalted.” \n"
    15: '¹⁵ People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on
      them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. '
    16: '¹⁶ But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children
      come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as
      these. '
    17: "¹⁷ Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like\
      \ a little child will never enter it.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal\
      \ life?” \n"
    19: '¹⁹ “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God
      alone. '
    20: "²⁰ You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not\
      \ murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your\
      \ father and mother.’” \n"
    21: "²¹ “All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said. \n"
    22: "²² When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell\
      \ everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\
      \ Then come, follow me.” \n"
    23: '²³ When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. '
    24: '²⁴ Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the
      kingdom of God! '
    25: "²⁵ Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than\
      \ for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” \n"
    27: "²⁷ Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.” \n"
    28: "²⁸ Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” \n"
    29: '²⁹ “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife
      or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of
      God '
    30: "³⁰ will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to\
      \ come eternal life.” \n"
    31: '³¹ Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up to Jerusalem,
      and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be
      fulfilled. '
    32: '³² He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult
      him and spit on him; '
    33: "³³ they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from\
      \ them, and they did not know what he was talking about. \n"
    35: '³⁵ As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. '
    36: '³⁶ When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. '
    37: "³⁷ They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” \n"
    38: "³⁸ He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” \n"
    39: "³⁹ Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted\
      \ all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near,
      Jesus asked him, '
    41: "⁴¹ “What do you want me to do for you?”\n“Lord, I want to see,” he replied.\
      \ \n"
    42: '⁴² Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” '
    43: ⁴³ Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When
      all the people saw it, they also praised God.
  19:
    1: '¹ Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. '
    2: '² A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and
      was wealthy. '
    3: '³ He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see
      over the crowd. '
    4: "⁴ So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus\
      \ was coming that way. \n"
    5: '⁵ When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come
      down immediately. I must stay at your house today.” '
    6: "⁶ So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. \n"
    7: "⁷ All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest\
      \ of a sinner.” \n"
    8: "⁸ But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I\
      \ give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out\
      \ of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.” \n"
    9: '⁹ Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this
      man, too, is a son of Abraham. '
    10: "¹⁰ For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” \n"
    11: '¹¹ While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable,
      because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God
      was going to appear at once. '
    12: '¹² He said: “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself
      appointed king and then to return. '
    13: "¹³ So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Put this money\
      \ to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’ \n"
    14: "¹⁴ “But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We\
      \ don’t want this man to be our king.’ \n"
    15: "¹⁵ “He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants\
      \ to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained\
      \ with it. \n"
    16: "¹⁶ “The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’ \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been\
      \ trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’ \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’ \n"
    20: '²⁰ “Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept
      it laid away in a piece of cloth. '
    21: "²¹ I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you\
      \ did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’ \n"
    22: '²² “His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant!
      You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and
      reaping what I did not sow? '
    23: "²³ Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back,\
      \ I could have collected it with interest?’ \n"
    24: "²⁴ “Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give\
      \ it to the one who has ten minas.’ \n"
    25: "²⁵ “‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’ \n"
    26: '²⁶ “He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given,
      but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. '
    27: "²⁷ But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring\
      \ them here and kill them in front of me.’” \n"
    28: '²⁸ After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. '
    29: '²⁹ As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of
      Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, '
    30: '³⁰ “Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a
      colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. '
    31: "³¹ If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”\
      \ \n"
    32: '³² Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. '
    33: "³³ As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying\
      \ the colt?” \n"
    34: "³⁴ They replied, “The Lord needs it.” \n"
    35: '³⁵ They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus
      on it. '
    36: "³⁶ As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. \n"
    37: "³⁷ When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives,\
      \ the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for\
      \ all the miracles they had seen: \n"
    38: "³⁸ “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”\n“Peace in heaven\
      \ and glory in the highest!” \n"
    39: "³⁹ Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your\
      \ disciples!” \n"
    40: "⁴⁰ “I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”\
      \ \n"
    41: '⁴¹ As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it '
    42: '⁴² and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring
      you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. '
    43: '⁴³ The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment
      against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. '
    44: "⁴⁴ They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.\
      \ They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the\
      \ time of God’s coming to you.” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who
      were selling. '
    46: "⁴⁶ “It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be a house of prayer’;\
      \ but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’” \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers
      of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. '
    48: ⁴⁸ Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on
      his words.
  20:
    1: '¹ One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming
      the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with
      the elders, came up to him. '
    2: "² “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who\
      \ gave you this authority?” \n"
    3: '³ He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me: '
    4: "⁴ John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?” \n"
    5: '⁵ They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’
      he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ '
    6: "⁶ But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because\
      \ they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” \n"
    7: "⁷ So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.” \n"
    8: "⁸ Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these\
      \ things.” \n"
    9: '⁹ He went on to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented
      it to some farmers and went away for a long time. '
    10: '¹⁰ At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him
      some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away
      empty-handed. '
    11: '¹¹ He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully
      and sent away empty-handed. '
    12: "¹² He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. \n"
    13: "¹³ “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my\
      \ son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’ \n"
    14: '¹⁴ “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the
      heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ '
    15: "¹⁵ So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n“What then will\
      \ the owner of the vineyard do to them? "
    16: "¹⁶ He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”\n\
      When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!” \n"
    17: "¹⁷ Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the meaning of\
      \ that which is written:\n“‘The stone the builders rejected\n    has become\
      \ the cornerstone’? \n"
    18: "¹⁸ Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom\
      \ it falls will be crushed.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest\
      \ him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them.\
      \ But they were afraid of the people. \n"
    20: '²⁰ Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere.
      They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him
      over to the power and authority of the governor. '
    21: '²¹ So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach
      what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God
      in accordance with the truth. '
    22: "²² Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” \n"
    23: '²³ He saw through their duplicity and said to them, '
    24: "²⁴ “Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”\n“Caesar’s,”\
      \ they replied. \n"
    25: "²⁵ He said to them, “Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God\
      \ what is God’s.” \n"
    26: "²⁶ They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And\
      \ astonished by his answer, they became silent. \n"
    27: '²⁷ Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus
      with a question. '
    28: '²⁸ “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies
      and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up
      offspring for his brother. '
    29: '²⁹ Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died
      childless. '
    30: '³⁰ The second '
    31: '³¹ and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving
      no children. '
    32: '³² Finally, the woman died too. '
    33: "³³ Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven\
      \ were married to her?” \n"
    34: '³⁴ Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. '
    35: '³⁵ But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come
      and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, '
    36: '³⁶ and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s
      children, since they are children of the resurrection. '
    37: '³⁷ But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead
      rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
      God of Jacob.’ '
    38: "³⁸ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”\
      \ \n"
    39: '³⁹ Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” '
    40: "⁴⁰ And no one dared to ask him any more questions. \n"
    41: '⁴¹ Then Jesus said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of
      David? '
    42: "⁴² David himself declares in the Book of Psalms:\n“‘The Lord said to my Lord:\n\
      \    “Sit at my right hand\n"
    43: "⁴³ until I make your enemies\n    a footstool for your feet.”’ \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, '
    46: '⁴⁶ “Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing
      robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most
      important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. '
    47: ⁴⁷ They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men
      will be punished most severely.”
  21:
    1: '¹ As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple
      treasury. '
    2: '² He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. '
    3: '³ “Truly I tell you,” he said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the
      others. '
    4: "⁴ All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her\
      \ poverty put in all she had to live on.” \n"
    5: '⁵ Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with
      beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, '
    6: "⁶ “As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be\
      \ left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.” \n"
    7: "⁷ “Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be\
      \ the sign that they are about to take place?” \n"
    8: '⁸ He replied: “Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in
      my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them. '
    9: "⁹ When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things\
      \ must happen first, but the end will not come right away.” \n"
    10: '¹⁰ Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
      kingdom. '
    11: "¹¹ There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places,\
      \ and fearful events and great signs from heaven. \n"
    12: '¹² “But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will
      hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before
      kings and governors, and all on account of my name. '
    13: '¹³ And so you will bear testimony to me. '
    14: '¹⁴ But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. '
    15: '¹⁵ For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will
      be able to resist or contradict. '
    16: '¹⁶ You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives
      and friends, and they will put some of you to death. '
    17: '¹⁷ Everyone will hate you because of me. '
    18: '¹⁸ But not a hair of your head will perish. '
    19: "¹⁹ Stand firm, and you will win life. \n"
    20: '²⁰ “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that
      its desolation is near. '
    21: '²¹ Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the
      city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. '
    22: '²² For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been
      written. '
    23: '²³ How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
      There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. '
    24: "²⁴ They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the\
      \ nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of\
      \ the Gentiles are fulfilled. \n"
    25: '²⁵ “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations
      will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. '
    26: '²⁶ People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world,
      for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. '
    27: '²⁷ At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power
      and great glory. '
    28: "²⁸ When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads,\
      \ because your redemption is drawing near.” \n"
    29: '²⁹ He told them this parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. '
    30: '³⁰ When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer
      is near. '
    31: "³¹ Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom\
      \ of God is near. \n"
    32: '³² “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until
      all these things have happened. '
    33: "³³ Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. \n"
    34: '³⁴ “Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness
      and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. '
    35: '³⁵ For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth. '
    36: "³⁶ Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that\
      \ is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.”\
      \ \n"
    37: '³⁷ Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out
      to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, '
    38: ³⁸ and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
  22:
    1: '¹ Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, '
    2: '² and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some
      way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. '
    3: '³ Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. '
    4: '⁴ And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard
      and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. '
    5: '⁵ They were delighted and agreed to give him money. '
    6: "⁶ He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them\
      \ when no crowd was present. \n"
    7: '⁷ Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to
      be sacrificed. '
    8: "⁸ Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat\
      \ the Passover.” \n"
    9: "⁹ “Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked. \n"
    10: '¹⁰ He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will
      meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, '
    11: '¹¹ and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest
      room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ '
    12: "¹² He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations\
      \ there.” \n"
    13: "¹³ They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared\
      \ the Passover. \n"
    14: '¹⁴ When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. '
    15: '¹⁵ And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with
      you before I suffer. '
    16: "¹⁶ For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in\
      \ the kingdom of God.” \n"
    17: '¹⁷ After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it
      among you. '
    18: "¹⁸ For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until\
      \ the kingdom of God comes.” \n"
    19: "¹⁹ And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying,\
      \ “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” \n"
    20: '²⁰ In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is
      the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. '
    21: '²¹ But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. '
    22: '²² The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who
      betrays him!” '
    23: "²³ They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who\
      \ would do this. \n"
    24: '²⁴ A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to
      be greatest. '
    25: '²⁵ Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and
      those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. '
    26: '²⁶ But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should
      be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. '
    27: '²⁷ For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves?
      Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. '
    28: '²⁸ You are those who have stood by me in my trials. '
    29: '²⁹ And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, '
    30: "³⁰ so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones,\
      \ judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \n"
    31: '³¹ “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. '
    32: "³² But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when\
      \ you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” \n"
    33: "³³ But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”\
      \ \n"
    34: "³⁴ Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you\
      \ will deny three times that you know me.” \n"
    35: "³⁵ Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,\
      \ did you lack anything?”\n“Nothing,” they answered. \n"
    36: '³⁶ He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag;
      and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. '
    37: "³⁷ It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’; and I tell\
      \ you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching\
      \ its fulfillment.” \n"
    38: "³⁸ The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.”\n“That’s enough!”\
      \ he replied. \n"
    39: '³⁹ Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed
      him. '
    40: '⁴⁰ On reaching the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into
      temptation.” '
    41: '⁴¹ He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, '
    42: '⁴² “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but
      yours be done.” '
    43: '⁴³ An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. '
    44: "⁴⁴ And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like\
      \ drops of blood falling to the ground. \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them
      asleep, exhausted from sorrow. '
    46: "⁴⁶ “Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will\
      \ not fall into temptation.” \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called
      Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, '
    48: "⁴⁸ but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”\
      \ \n"
    49: '⁴⁹ When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord,
      should we strike with our swords?” '
    50: "⁵⁰ And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his\
      \ right ear. \n"
    51: "⁵¹ But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and\
      \ healed him. \n"
    52: '⁵² Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard,
      and the elders, who had come for him, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have
      come with swords and clubs? '
    53: "⁵³ Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand\
      \ on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.” \n"
    54: '⁵⁴ Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the
      high priest. Peter followed at a distance. '
    55: '⁵⁵ And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard
      and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. '
    56: "⁵⁶ A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely\
      \ at him and said, “This man was with him.” \n"
    57: "⁵⁷ But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said. \n"
    58: "⁵⁸ A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”\n\
      “Man, I am not!” Peter replied. \n"
    59: "⁵⁹ About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with\
      \ him, for he is a Galilean.” \n"
    60: '⁶⁰ Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as
      he was speaking, the rooster crowed. '
    61: '⁶¹ The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the
      word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown
      me three times.” '
    62: "⁶² And he went outside and wept bitterly. \n"
    63: '⁶³ The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. '
    64: '⁶⁴ They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” '
    65: "⁶⁵ And they said many other insulting things to him. \n"
    66: '⁶⁶ At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests
      and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. '
    67: "⁶⁷ “If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.”\nJesus answered, “If I\
      \ tell you, you will not believe me, "
    68: '⁶⁸ and if I asked you, you would not answer. '
    69: "⁶⁹ But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the\
      \ mighty God.” \n"
    70: "⁷⁰ They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”\nHe replied, “You say that\
      \ I am.” \n"
    71: ⁷¹ Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from
      his own lips.”
  23:
    1: '¹ Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. '
    2: "² And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting\
      \ our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah,\
      \ a king.” \n"
    3: "³ So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”\n“You have said so,”\
      \ Jesus replied. \n"
    4: "⁴ Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis\
      \ for a charge against this man.” \n"
    5: "⁵ But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching.\
      \ He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.” \n"
    6: '⁶ On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. '
    7: "⁷ When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to\
      \ Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. \n"
    8: '⁸ When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he
      had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see
      him perform a sign of some sort. '
    9: '⁹ He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. '
    10: '¹⁰ The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently
      accusing him. '
    11: '¹¹ Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in
      an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. '
    12: "¹² That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies.\
      \ \n"
    13: '¹³ Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, '
    14: '¹⁴ and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the
      people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no
      basis for your charges against him. '
    15: '¹⁵ Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has
      done nothing to deserve death. '
    16: '¹⁶ Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.” '
    17: "¹⁷  \n"
    18: '¹⁸ But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to
      us!” '
    19: "¹⁹ (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city,\
      \ and for murder.) \n"
    20: '²⁰ Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. '
    21: "²¹ But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” \n"
    22: "²² For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed?\
      \ I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have\
      \ him punished and then release him.” \n"
    23: '²³ But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and
      their shouts prevailed. '
    24: '²⁴ So Pilate decided to grant their demand. '
    25: "²⁵ He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and\
      \ murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will. \n"
    26: '²⁶ As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on
      his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it
      behind Jesus. '
    27: '²⁷ A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and
      wailed for him. '
    28: '²⁸ Jesus turned and said to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for
      me; weep for yourselves and for your children. '
    29: '²⁹ For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the childless women,
      the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’ '
    30: "³⁰ Then\n“‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!”\n    and to the\
      \ hills, “Cover us!”’ \n"
    31: "³¹ For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen\
      \ when it is dry?” \n"
    32: '³² Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. '
    33: '³³ When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there,
      along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. '
    34: "³⁴ Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are\
      \ doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots. \n"
    35: "³⁵ The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said,\
      \ “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen\
      \ One.” \n"
    36: '³⁶ The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar '
    37: "³⁷ and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.” \n"
    38: "³⁸ There was a written notice above him, which read: this is the king of\
      \ the jews. \n"
    39: "³⁹ One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you\
      \ the Messiah? Save yourself and us!” \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since
      you are under the same sentence? '
    41: "⁴¹ We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But\
      \ this man has done nothing wrong.” \n"
    42: "⁴² Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” \n"
    43: "⁴³ Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”\
      \ \n"
    44: '⁴⁴ It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three
      in the afternoon, '
    45: '⁴⁵ for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in
      two. '
    46: "⁴⁶ Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit\
      \ my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last. \n"
    47: '⁴⁷ The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely
      this was a righteous man.” '
    48: '⁴⁸ When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took
      place, they beat their breasts and went away. '
    49: "⁴⁹ But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from\
      \ Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and
      upright man, '
    51: '⁵¹ who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean
      town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. '
    52: '⁵² Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body. '
    53: '⁵³ Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb
      cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. '
    54: "⁵⁴ It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. \n"
    55: '⁵⁵ The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw
      the tomb and how his body was laid in it. '
    56: ⁵⁶ Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on
      the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
  24:
    1: '¹ On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took
      the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. '
    2: '² They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, '
    3: '³ but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. '
    4: '⁴ While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed
      like lightning stood beside them. '
    5: '⁵ In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but
      the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? '
    6: '⁶ He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still
      with you in Galilee: '
    7: '⁷ ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified
      and on the third day be raised again.’ ” '
    8: "⁸ Then they remembered his words. \n"
    9: '⁹ When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven
      and to all the others. '
    10: '¹⁰ It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others
      with them who told this to the apostles. '
    11: '¹¹ But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them
      like nonsense. '
    12: "¹² Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips\
      \ of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what\
      \ had happened. \n"
    13: '¹³ Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about
      seven miles from Jerusalem. '
    14: '¹⁴ They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. '
    15: '¹⁵ As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself
      came up and walked along with them; '
    16: "¹⁶ but they were kept from recognizing him. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?”\n\
      They stood still, their faces downcast. "
    18: "¹⁸ One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting\
      \ Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”\
      \ \n"
    19: "¹⁹ “What things?” he asked.\n“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He\
      \ was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. "
    20: '²⁰ The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death,
      and they crucified him; '
    21: '²¹ but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And
      what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. '
    22: '²² In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early
      this morning '
    23: '²³ but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision
      of angels, who said he was alive. '
    24: "²⁴ Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the\
      \ women had said, but they did not see Jesus.” \n"
    25: '²⁵ He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that
      the prophets have spoken! '
    26: '²⁶ Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” '
    27: "²⁷ And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what\
      \ was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. \n"
    28: '²⁸ As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued
      on as if he were going farther. '
    29: "²⁹ But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening;\
      \ the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. \n"
    30: '³⁰ When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke
      it and began to give it to them. '
    31: '³¹ Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared
      from their sight. '
    32: "³² They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he\
      \ talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” \n"
    33: '³³ They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven
      and those with them, assembled together '
    34: '³⁴ and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” '
    35: "³⁵ Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized\
      \ by them when he broke the bread. \n"
    36: "³⁶ While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them\
      \ and said to them, “Peace be with you.” \n"
    37: '³⁷ They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. '
    38: '³⁸ He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your
      minds? '
    39: "³⁹ Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost\
      \ does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” \n"
    40: '⁴⁰ When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. '
    41: '⁴¹ And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement,
      he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” '
    42: '⁴² They gave him a piece of broiled fish, '
    43: "⁴³ and he took it and ate it in their presence. \n"
    44: "⁴⁴ He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you:\
      \ Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses,\
      \ the Prophets and the Psalms.” \n"
    45: '⁴⁵ Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. '
    46: '⁴⁶ He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise
      from the dead on the third day, '
    47: '⁴⁷ and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name
      to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. '
    48: '⁴⁸ You are witnesses of these things. '
    49: "⁴⁹ I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city\
      \ until you have been clothed with power from on high.” \n"
    50: '⁵⁰ When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his
      hands and blessed them. '
    51: '⁵¹ While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. '
    52: '⁵² Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. '
    53: ⁵³ And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
