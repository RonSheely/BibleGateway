Zephaniah:
  1:
    1: "¹ The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah,\
      \ the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son of\
      \ Amon king of Judah: \n"
    2: "² “I will sweep away everything\n    from the face of the earth,”\ndeclares\
      \ the Lord.\n"
    3: "³ “I will sweep away both man and beast;\n    I will sweep away the birds\
      \ in the sky\n    and the fish in the sea—\n    and the idols that cause the\
      \ wicked to stumble.”\n“When I destroy all mankind\n    on the face of the earth,”\n\
      declares the Lord,\n"
    4: "⁴ “I will stretch out my hand against Judah\n    and against all who live\
      \ in Jerusalem.\nI will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place,\n\
      \    the very names of the idolatrous priests—\n"
    5: "⁵ those who bow down on the roofs\n    to worship the starry host,\nthose\
      \ who bow down and swear by the Lord\n    and who also swear by Molek,\n"
    6: "⁶ those who turn back from following the Lord\n    and neither seek the Lord\
      \ nor inquire of him.” \n"
    7: "⁷ Be silent before the Sovereign Lord,\n    for the day of the Lord is near.\n\
      The Lord has prepared a sacrifice;\n    he has consecrated those he has invited.\
      \ \n"
    8: "⁸ “On the day of the Lord’s sacrifice\n    I will punish the officials\n \
      \   and the king’s sons\nand all those clad\n    in foreign clothes.\n"
    9: "⁹ On that day I will punish\n    all who avoid stepping on the threshold,\n\
      who fill the temple of their gods\n    with violence and deceit. \n"
    10: "¹⁰ “On that day,”\n    declares the Lord,\n“a cry will go up from the Fish\
      \ Gate,\n    wailing from the New Quarter,\n    and a loud crash from the hills.\n"
    11: "¹¹ Wail, you who live in the market district;\n    all your merchants will\
      \ be wiped out,\n    all who trade with silver will be destroyed.\n"
    12: "¹² At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps\n    and punish those\
      \ who are complacent,\n    who are like wine left on its dregs,\nwho think,\
      \ ‘The Lord will do nothing,\n    either good or bad.’\n"
    13: "¹³ Their wealth will be plundered,\n    their houses demolished.\nThough\
      \ they build houses,\n    they will not live in them;\nthough they plant vineyards,\n\
      \    they will not drink the wine.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ The great day of the Lord is near—\n    near and coming quickly.\nThe\
      \ cry on the day of the Lord is bitter;\n    the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle\
      \ cry.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ That day will be a day of wrath—\n    a day of distress and anguish,\n\
      \        a day of trouble and ruin,\n    a day of darkness and gloom,\n    \
      \    a day of clouds and blackness—\n"
    16: "¹⁶     a day of trumpet and battle cry\nagainst the fortified cities\n  \
      \  and against the corner towers. \n"
    17: "¹⁷ “I will bring such distress on all people\n    that they will grope about\
      \ like those who are blind,\n    because they have sinned against the Lord.\n\
      Their blood will be poured out like dust\n    and their entrails like dung.\n"
    18: "¹⁸ Neither their silver nor their gold\n    will be able to save them\n \
      \   on the day of the Lord’s wrath.”\nIn the fire of his jealousy\n    the whole\
      \ earth will be consumed,\nfor he will make a sudden end\n    of all who live\
      \ on the earth."
  2:
    1: "¹ Gather together, gather yourselves together,\n    you shameful nation,\n"
    2: "² before the decree takes effect\n    and that day passes like windblown chaff,\n\
      before the Lord’s fierce anger\n    comes upon you,\nbefore the day of the Lord’s\
      \ wrath\n    comes upon you.\n"
    3: "³ Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land,\n    you who do what he commands.\n\
      Seek righteousness, seek humility;\n    perhaps you will be sheltered\n    on\
      \ the day of the Lord’s anger. \n"
    4: "⁴ Gaza will be abandoned\n    and Ashkelon left in ruins.\nAt midday Ashdod\
      \ will be emptied\n    and Ekron uprooted.\n"
    5: "⁵ Woe to you who live by the sea,\n    you Kerethite people;\nthe word of\
      \ the Lord is against you,\n    Canaan, land of the Philistines.\nHe says, “I\
      \ will destroy you,\n    and none will be left.”\n"
    6: "⁶ The land by the sea will become pastures\n    having wells for shepherds\n\
      \    and pens for flocks.\n"
    7: "⁷ That land will belong\n    to the remnant of the people of Judah;\n    there\
      \ they will find pasture.\nIn the evening they will lie down\n    in the houses\
      \ of Ashkelon.\nThe Lord their God will care for them;\n    he will restore\
      \ their fortunes. \n"
    8: "⁸ “I have heard the insults of Moab\n    and the taunts of the Ammonites,\n\
      who insulted my people\n    and made threats against their land.\n"
    9: "⁹ Therefore, as surely as I live,”\n    declares the Lord Almighty,\n    the\
      \ God of Israel,\n“surely Moab will become like Sodom,\n    the Ammonites like\
      \ Gomorrah—\na place of weeds and salt pits,\n    a wasteland forever.\nThe\
      \ remnant of my people will plunder them;\n    the survivors of my nation will\
      \ inherit their land.” \n"
    10: "¹⁰ This is what they will get in return for their pride,\n    for insulting\
      \ and mocking\n    the people of the Lord Almighty.\n"
    11: "¹¹ The Lord will be awesome to them\n    when he destroys all the gods of\
      \ the earth.\nDistant nations will bow down to him,\n    all of them in their\
      \ own lands. \n"
    12: "¹² “You Cushites, too,\n    will be slain by my sword.” \n"
    13: "¹³ He will stretch out his hand against the north\n    and destroy Assyria,\n\
      leaving Nineveh utterly desolate\n    and dry as the desert.\n"
    14: "¹⁴ Flocks and herds will lie down there,\n    creatures of every kind.\n\
      The desert owl and the screech owl\n    will roost on her columns.\nTheir hooting\
      \ will echo through the windows,\n    rubble will fill the doorways,\n    the\
      \ beams of cedar will be exposed.\n"
    15: "¹⁵ This is the city of revelry\n    that lived in safety.\nShe said to herself,\n\
      \    “I am the one! And there is none besides me.”\nWhat a ruin she has become,\n\
      \    a lair for wild beasts!\nAll who pass by her scoff\n    and shake their\
      \ fists."
  3:
    1: "¹ Woe to the city of oppressors,\n    rebellious and defiled!\n"
    2: "² She obeys no one,\n    she accepts no correction.\nShe does not trust in\
      \ the Lord,\n    she does not draw near to her God.\n"
    3: "³ Her officials within her\n    are roaring lions;\nher rulers are evening\
      \ wolves,\n    who leave nothing for the morning.\n"
    4: "⁴ Her prophets are unprincipled;\n    they are treacherous people.\nHer priests\
      \ profane the sanctuary\n    and do violence to the law.\n"
    5: "⁵ The Lord within her is righteous;\n    he does no wrong.\nMorning by morning\
      \ he dispenses his justice,\n    and every new day he does not fail,\n    yet\
      \ the unrighteous know no shame. \n"
    6: "⁶ “I have destroyed nations;\n    their strongholds are demolished.\nI have\
      \ left their streets deserted,\n    with no one passing through.\nTheir cities\
      \ are laid waste;\n    they are deserted and empty.\n"
    7: "⁷ Of Jerusalem I thought,\n    ‘Surely you will fear me\n    and accept correction!’\n\
      Then her place of refuge would not be destroyed,\n    nor all my punishments\
      \ come upon her.\nBut they were still eager\n    to act corruptly in all they\
      \ did.\n"
    8: "⁸ Therefore wait for me,”\n    declares the Lord,\n    “for the day I will\
      \ stand up to testify.\nI have decided to assemble the nations,\n    to gather\
      \ the kingdoms\nand to pour out my wrath on them—\n    all my fierce anger.\n\
      The whole world will be consumed\n    by the fire of my jealous anger. \n"
    9: "⁹ “Then I will purify the lips of the peoples,\n    that all of them may call\
      \ on the name of the Lord\n    and serve him shoulder to shoulder.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ From beyond the rivers of Cush\n    my worshipers, my scattered people,\n\
      \    will bring me offerings.\n"
    11: "¹¹ On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame\n    for all the\
      \ wrongs you have done to me,\nbecause I will remove from you\n    your arrogant\
      \ boasters.\nNever again will you be haughty\n    on my holy hill.\n"
    12: "¹² But I will leave within you\n    the meek and humble.\nThe remnant of\
      \ Israel\n    will trust in the name of the Lord.\n"
    13: "¹³ They will do no wrong;\n    they will tell no lies.\nA deceitful tongue\n\
      \    will not be found in their mouths.\nThey will eat and lie down\n    and\
      \ no one will make them afraid.” \n"
    14: "¹⁴ Sing, Daughter Zion;\n    shout aloud, Israel!\nBe glad and rejoice with\
      \ all your heart,\n    Daughter Jerusalem!\n"
    15: "¹⁵ The Lord has taken away your punishment,\n    he has turned back your\
      \ enemy.\nThe Lord, the King of Israel, is with you;\n    never again will you\
      \ fear any harm.\n"
    16: "¹⁶ On that day\n    they will say to Jerusalem,\n“Do not fear, Zion;\n  \
      \  do not let your hands hang limp.\n"
    17: "¹⁷ The Lord your God is with you,\n    the Mighty Warrior who saves.\nHe\
      \ will take great delight in you;\n    in his love he will no longer rebuke\
      \ you,\n    but will rejoice over you with singing.” \n"
    18: "¹⁸ “I will remove from you\n    all who mourn over the loss of your appointed\
      \ festivals,\n    which is a burden and reproach for you.\n"
    19: "¹⁹ At that time I will deal\n    with all who oppressed you.\nI will rescue\
      \ the lame;\n    I will gather the exiles.\nI will give them praise and honor\n\
      \    in every land where they have suffered shame.\n"
    20: "²⁰ At that time I will gather you;\n    at that time I will bring you home.\n\
      I will give you honor and praise\n    among all the peoples of the earth\nwhen\
      \ I restore your fortunes\n    before your very eyes,”\nsays the Lord."
